In this they were like the ruling-class of any other country, particularly of Great Britain, but they differed in being more vigorous and in actually trying to produce the accepted standards which all classes, everywhere, desire, but usually despair of realizing. The longest struggle of the Good Citizens' League was against the Open Shop--which was secretly a struggle against all union labor. Accompanying it was an Americanization Movement, with evening classes in English and history and economics, and daily articles in the newspapers, so that newly arrived foreigners might learn that the true-blue and one hundred per cent.

It was a brown boyish room; disordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of basket-ball teams and baseball teams. Ted was decidedly not there.

But Littlefield's great value was as a spiritual example. Despite his strange learnings he was as strict a Presbyterian and as firm a Republican as George F. Babbitt. He confirmed the business men in the faith. Where they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of industry and manners was perfect, Dr. Howard Littlefield proved it to them, out of history, economics, and the confessions of reformed radicals. Babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a savant, and in Ted's intimacy with Eunice Littlefield. At sixteen Eunice was interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages and salaries of motion-picture stars, but--as Babbitt definitively put it--\u201cshe was her father's daughter.\u201d The difference between a light man like Sam Doppelbrau and a really fine character like Littlefield was revealed in their appearances.", " Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time whisky, but then, it was only twice-- Dr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in.

He was distressed by the sight of his wife's slack plumpness, by her puffs and billows of flesh, by the tattered petticoat which she was always meaning and always forgetting to throw away. But he was aware that she, so long attuned to him, caught all his repulsions. He elaborately, heavily, jocularly tried to check them. He couldn't. They had a tolerable Christmas. Kenneth Escott was there, admittedly engaged to Verona. Mrs. Babbitt was tearful and called Kenneth her new son.

CHAPTER XXVI I As he walked through the train, looking for familiar faces, he saw only one person whom he knew, and that was Seneca Doane, the lawyer who, after the blessings of being in Babbitt's own class at college and of becoming a corporation-counsel, had turned crank, had headed farmer-labor tickets and fraternized with admitted socialists. Though he was in rebellion, naturally Babbitt did not care to be seen talking with such a fanatic, but in all the Pullmans he could find no other acquaintance, and reluctantly he halted. Seneca Doane was a slight, thin-haired man, rather like Chum Frink except that he hadn't Frink's grin. He was reading a book called \u201cThe Way of All Flesh.\u201d It looked religious to Babbitt, and he wondered if Doane could possibly have been converted and turned decent and patriotic.", " He even praised Seneca Doane. Professor Pumphrey said that was carrying a joke too far; but Babbitt argued, \u201cNo! Fact! I tell you he's got one of the keenest intellects in the country. Why, Lord Wycombe said that--\u201d \u201cOh, who the hell is Lord Wycombe? What you always lugging him in for? You been touting him for the last six weeks!\u201d protested Orville Jones. \u201cGeorge ordered him from Sears-Roebuck. You can get those English high-muckamucks by mail for two bucks apiece,\u201d suggested Sidney Finkelstein. \u201cThat's all right now! Lord Wycombe, he's one of the biggest intellects in English political life. As I was saying: Of course I'm conservative myself, but I appreciate a guy like Senny Doane because--\u201d Vergil Gunch interrupted harshly, \u201cI wonder if you are so conservative? I find I can manage to run my own business without any skunks and reds like Doane in it!\u201d The grimness of Gunch's voice, the hardness of his jaw, disconcerted Babbitt, but he recovered and went on till they looked bored, then irritated, then as doubtful as Gunch.", " He fumbled: \u201cI suppose you'd especially light on fellows like Seneca Doane and try to make 'em--\u201d \u201cYou bet your sweet life we would! Look here, old Georgie: I've never for one moment believed you meant it when you've defended Doane, and the strikers and so on, at the Club. I knew you were simply kidding those poor galoots like Sid Finkelstein.... At least I certainly hope you were kidding!\u201d \u201cOh, well--sure--Course you might say--\u201d Babbitt was conscious of how feeble he sounded, conscious of Gunch's mature and relentless eye. \u201cGosh, you know where I stand! I'm no labor agitator! I'm a business man, first, last, and all the time! But--but honestly, I don't think Doane means so badly, and you got to remember he's an old friend of mine.\u201d \u201cGeorge, when it comes right down to a struggle between decency and the security of our homes on the one hand, and red ruin and those lazy dogs plotting for free beer on the other, you got to give up even old friendships.", " \u201cI'd like to know how it hasn't!

Before he was through with it, Babbitt had Ted a United States Senator. Among the great lawyers whom he mentioned was Seneca Doane. \u201cBut, gee whiz,\u201d Ted marveled, \u201cI thought you always said this Doane was a reg'lar nut!\u201d \u201cThat's no way to speak of a great man! Doane's always been a good friend of mine--fact I helped him in college--I started him out and you might say inspired him. Just because he's sympathetic with the aims of Labor, a lot of chumps that lack liberality and broad-mindedness think he's a crank, but let me tell you there's mighty few of 'em that rake in the fees he does, and he's a friend of some of the strongest; most conservative men in the world--like Lord Wycombe, this, uh, this big English nobleman that's so well known."], "How would Prout's political philosophy best be described?": [" He acquired a fame enduring for weeks. Now and then a reporter was present at one of his meetings, and the headlines (though they were not very large) indicated that George F.

Once, in the rotogravure section of the Sunday Advocate-Times, there was a photograph of Babbitt and a dozen other business men, with the caption \u201cLeaders of Zenith Finance and Commerce Who Back Prout.\u201d He deserved his glory. He was an excellent campaigner. He had faith; he was certain that if Lincoln were alive, he would be electioneering for Mr. W. G. Harding--unless he came to Zenith and electioneered for Lucas Prout. He did not confuse audiences by silly subtleties; Prout represented honest industry, Seneca Doane represented whining laziness, and you could take your choice. With his broad shoulders and vigorous voice, he was obviously a Good Fellow; and, rarest of all, he really liked people.", " The guests were Howard Littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who furnished publicity and comforting economics to the Street Traction Company; Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the Elks and in the Boosters' Club; Eddie Swanson the agent for the Javelin Motor Car, who lived across the street; and Orville Jones, owner of the Lily White Laundry, which justly announced itself \u201cthe biggest, busiest, bulliest cleanerie shoppe in Zenith.\u201d But, naturally, the most distinguished of all was T. Cholmondeley Frink, who was not only the author of \u201cPoemulations,\u201d which, syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading newspapers, gave him one of the largest audiences of any poet in the world, but also an optimistic lecturer and the creator of \u201cAds that Add.\u201d Despite the searching philosophy and high morality of his verses, they were humorous and easily understood by any child of twelve; and it added a neat air of pleasantry to them that they were set not as verse but as prose.", " The attendant returned with \u201cRiesling says he don't want to see you.\u201d \u201cYou're crazy!

If it had any consequences, they have not been discovered. CHAPTER XIV THIS autumn a Mr. W. G. Harding, of Marion, Ohio, was appointed President of the United States, but Zenith was less interested in the national campaign than in the local election. Seneca Doane, though he was a lawyer and a graduate of the State University, was candidate for mayor of Zenith on an alarming labor ticket. To oppose him the Democrats and Republicans united on Lucas Prout, a mattress-manufacturer with a perfect record for sanity. Mr. Prout was supported by the banks, the Chamber of Commerce, all the decent newspapers, and George F. Babbitt. Babbitt was precinct-leader on Floral Heights, but his district was safe and he longed for stouter battling. His convention paper had given him the beginning of a reputation for oratory, so the Republican-Democratic Central Committee sent him to the Seventh Ward and South Zenith, to address small audiences of workmen and clerks, and wives uneasy with their new votes."], "How would Verona's beliefs best be characterized?": [" Thereafter he was often seen at the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church, but it is recorded that he avoided shaking hands with the pastor at the door. III If his moral fiber had been so weakened by rebellion that he was not quite dependable in the more rigorous campaigns of the Good Citizens' League nor quite appreciative of the church, yet there was no doubt of the joy with which Babbitt returned to the pleasures of his home and of the Athletic Club, the Boosters, the Elks. Verona and Kenneth Escott were eventually and hesitatingly married. For the wedding Babbitt was dressed as carefully as was Verona; he was crammed into the morning-coat he wore to teas thrice a year; and with a certain relief, after Verona and Kenneth had driven away in a limousine, he returned to the house, removed the morning coat, sat with his aching feet up on the davenport, and reflected that his wife and he could have the living-room to themselves now, and not have to listen to Verona and Kenneth worrying, in a cultured collegiate manner, about minimum wages and the Drama League.", " Cigar-lighter gives tone to the dashboard.\u201d \u201cYep, finally decided I'd buy me one. Got the best on the market, the clerk said it was. Paid five bucks for it. Just wondering if I got stuck. What do they charge for 'em at the store, Sid?\u201d Finkelstein asserted that five dollars was not too great a sum, not for a really high-class lighter which was suitably nickeled and provided with connections of the very best quality. \u201cI always say--and believe me, I base it on a pretty fairly extensive mercantile experience--the best is the cheapest in the long run. Of course if a fellow wants to be a Jew about it, he can get cheap junk, but in the long RUN, the cheapest thing is--the best you can get! Now you take here just th' other day: I got a new top for my old boat and some upholstery, and I paid out a hundred and twenty-six fifty, and of course a lot of fellows would say that was too much--Lord, if the Old Folks--they live in one of these hick towns up-state and they simply can't get onto the way a city fellow's mind works, and then, of course, they're Jews, and they'd lie right down and die if they knew Sid had anted up a hundred and twenty-six bones.", " The windows were large and easily opened, with the best catches and cords, and Holland roller-shades guaranteed not to crack. It was a masterpiece among bedrooms, right out of Cheerful Modern Houses for Medium Incomes. Only it had nothing to do with the Babbitts, nor with any one else. If people had ever lived and loved here, read thrillers at midnight and lain in beautiful indolence on a Sunday morning, there were no signs of it. It had the air of being a very good room in a very good hotel. One expected the chambermaid to come in and make it ready for people who would stay but one night, go without looking back, and never think of it again. Every second house in Floral Heights had a bedroom precisely like this. The Babbitts' house was five years old. It was all as competent and glossy as this bedroom. It had the best of taste, the best of inexpensive rugs, a simple and laudable architecture, and the latest conveniences.", " Can't get your fist onto 'em.

Well, you know how Your Father was, and this Smith knew it too; he knew what a Real Man he was, and he knew Your Father knew the political situation from A to Z, and he ought to have seen that here was one man he couldn't impose on, but he went on trying to and hinting and trying till Your Father spoke up and said to him, 'Captain Smith,' he said, 'I have a reputation around these parts for being one who is amply qualified to mind his own business and let other folks mind theirs!'", " Then Babbitt's own mother came down from Catawba to spend three weeks.

We don't mind a little bullying, if it's necessary. Babbitt, the G.C.L. has been talking about you a good deal. You're supposed to be a sensible, clean, responsible man; you always have been; but here lately, for God knows what reason, I hear from all sorts of sources that you're running around with a loose crowd, and what's a whole lot worse, you've actually been advocating and supporting some of the most dangerous elements in town, like this fellow Doane.\u201d \u201cColonel, that strikes me as my private business.\u201d \u201cPossibly, but we want to have an understanding.

Why had he lied to the clerk about being Paul's brother-in-law? He had acted like a child. He must be careful not to say foolish dramatic things to Paul."], "How would Babbitt's relationship with Myra best be characterized?": [" Where Zilla mocked him as a country boy, Myra said indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young dandies who had been born in the great city of Zenith--an ancient settlement in 1897, one hundred and five years old, with two hundred thousand population, the queen and wonder of all the state and, to the Catawba boy, George Babbitt, so vast and thunderous and luxurious that he was flattered to know a girl ennobled by birth in Zenith. Of love there was no talk between them. He knew that if he was to study law he could not marry for years; and Myra was distinctly a Nice Girl--one didn't kiss her, one didn't \u201cthink about her that way at all\u201d unless one was going to marry her. But she was a dependable companion. She was always ready to go skating, walking; always content to hear his discourses on the great things he was going to do, the distressed poor whom he would defend against the Unjust Rich, the speeches he would make at Banquets, the inexactitudes of popular thought which he would correct.", " Let me do SOMETHING!\u201d \u201cI'm sorry, Babbitt, but the best thing you can do--I hate to say it, but you could help us most by keeping strictly out of it.\u201d Babbitt, revolving his hat like a defaulting poor tenant, winced so visibly that Maxwell condescended: \u201cI don't like to hurt your feelings, but you see we both want to do our best for Riesling, and we mustn't consider any other factor. The trouble with you, Babbitt, is that you're one of these fellows who talk too readily. You like to hear your own voice.

She holds the wheel like an old professional!\u201d All the while he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his wife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent. III There was about the house an unofficial theory that he was to take his vacation alone, to spend a week or ten days in Catawba, but he was nagged by the memory that a year ago he had been with Paul in Maine. He saw himself returning; finding peace there, and the presence of Paul, in a life primitive and heroic. Like a shock came the thought that he actually could go. Only, he couldn't, really; he couldn't leave his business, and \u201cMyra would think it sort of funny, his going way off there alone. Course he'd decided to do whatever he darned pleased, from now on, but still--to go way off to Maine!\u201d He went, after lengthy meditations.", " Cigar-lighter gives tone to the dashboard.\u201d \u201cYep, finally decided I'd buy me one.

I'm surprised you can act so doggone common, Zilla!\u201d She brooded over her linked fingers. \u201cOh, I know. I do go and get mean sometimes, and I'm sorry afterwards. But, oh, Georgie, Paul is so aggravating! Honestly, I've tried awfully hard, these last few years, to be nice to him, but just because I used to be spiteful--or I seemed so; I wasn't, really, but I used to speak up and say anything that came into my head--and so he made up his mind that everything was my fault.", " It smelled of cosmetics, of linen, of sleep. He napped and woke, napped and woke, a hundred times. He heard her move and sigh in slumber; he wondered if there wasn't some officious brisk thing he could do for her, and before he could quite form the thought he was asleep, racked and aching. The night was infinite. When dawn came and the waiting seemed at an end, he fell asleep, and was vexed to have been caught off his guard, to have been aroused by Verona's entrance and her agitated \u201cOh, what is it, Dad?\u201d His wife was awake, her face sallow and lifeless in the morning light, but now he did not compare her with Tanis; she was not merely A Woman, to be contrasted with other women, but his own self, and though he might criticize her and nag her, it was only as he might criticize and nag himself, interestedly, unpatronizingly, without the expectation of changing--or any real desire to change--the eternal essence.", " Many members of the Athletic Club did go camping without their wives, but they were officially dedicated to fishing and hunting, whereas the sacred and unchangeable sports of Babbitt and Paul Riesling were golfing, motoring, and bridge. For either the fishermen or the golfers to have changed their habits would have been an infraction of their self-imposed discipline which would have shocked all right-thinking and regularized citizens. Babbitt blustered, \u201cWhy don't we just put our foot down and say, 'We're going on ahead of you, and that's all there is to it!' Nothing criminal in it. Simply say to Zilla--\u201d \u201cYou don't say anything to Zilla simply. Why, Georgie, she's almost as much of a moralist as you are, and if I told her the truth she'd believe we were going to meet some dames in New York. And even Myra--she never nags you, the way Zilla does, but she'd worry. She'd say, 'Don't you WANT me to go to Maine with you?", " He mentioned his friends, Lord Wycombe, Colonel Wedgwood, Professor Piccoli. Babbitt had always supposed that Doane associated only with the I. W. W., but now he nodded gravely, as one who knew Lord Wycombes by the score, and he got in two references to Sir Gerald Doak. He felt daring and idealistic and cosmopolitan. Suddenly, in his new spiritual grandeur, he was sorry for Zilla Riesling, and understood her as these ordinary fellows at the Boosters' Club never could. II Five hours after he had arrived in Zenith and told his wife how hot it was in New York, he went to call on Zilla. He was buzzing with ideas and forgiveness. He'd get Paul released; he'd do things, vague but highly benevolent things, for Zilla; he'd be as generous as his friend Seneca Doane. He had not seen Zilla since Paul had shot her, and he still pictured her as buxom, high-colored, lively, and a little blowsy. As he drove up to her boarding-house, in a depressing back street below the wholesale district, he stopped in discomfort."], "How would religion in Zenith best be described?": [" Babbitt and Frink were enchanted to join him. III If you had asked Babbitt what his religion was, he would have answered in sonorous Boosters'-Club rhetoric, \u201cMy religion is to serve my fellow men, to honor my brother as myself, and to do my bit to make life happier for one and all.\u201d If you had pressed him for more detail, he would have announced, \u201cI'm a member of the Presbyterian Church, and naturally, I accept its doctrines.\u201d If you had been so brutal as to go on, he would have protested, \u201cThere's no use discussing and arguing about religion; it just stirs up bad feeling.\u201d Actually, the content of his theology was that there was a supreme being who had tried to make us perfect, but presumably had failed; that if one was a Good Man he would go to a place called Heaven (Babbitt unconsciously pictured it as rather like an excellent hotel with a private garden), but if one was a Bad Man, that is, if he murdered or committed burglary or used cocaine or had mistresses or sold non-existent real estate, he would be punished.", " Cigar-lighter gives tone to the dashboard.\u201d \u201cYep, finally decided I'd buy me one.

It was a masterpiece among bedrooms, right out of Cheerful Modern Houses for Medium Incomes. Only it had nothing to do with the Babbitts, nor with any one else. If people had ever lived and loved here, read thrillers at midnight and lain in beautiful indolence on a Sunday morning, there were no signs of it. It had the air of being a very good room in a very good hotel. One expected the chambermaid to come in and make it ready for people who would stay but one night, go without looking back, and never think of it again. Every second house in Floral Heights had a bedroom precisely like this. The Babbitts' house was five years old. It was all as competent and glossy as this bedroom. It had the best of taste, the best of inexpensive rugs, a simple and laudable architecture, and the latest conveniences.", " Let me do SOMETHING!\u201d \u201cI'm sorry, Babbitt, but the best thing you can do--I hate to say it, but you could help us most by keeping strictly out of it.\u201d Babbitt, revolving his hat like a defaulting poor tenant, winced so visibly that Maxwell condescended: \u201cI don't like to hurt your feelings, but you see we both want to do our best for Riesling, and we mustn't consider any other factor.

Facts like the above, followed by a straight-arm appeal, will reach folks who can never be laughed or jollied into doing their part.\u201d Babbitt admitted, \u201cThat's so. I used to skin out of the ole Sunday School at Catawba every chance I got, but same time, I wouldn't be where I am to-day, maybe, if it hadn't been for its training in--in moral power. And all about the Bible. (Great literature. Have to read some of it again, one of these days).\u201d How scientifically the Sunday School could be organized he learned from an article in the Westminster Adult Bible Class: \u201cThe second vice-president looks after the fellowship of the class. She chooses a group to help her. These become ushers. Every one who comes gets a glad hand. No one goes away a stranger. One member of the group stands on the doorstep and invites passers-by to come in.\u201d Perhaps most of all Babbitt appreciated the remarks by William H. Ridgway in the Sunday School Times: \u201cIf you have a Sunday School class without any pep and get-up-and-go in it, that is, without interest, that is uncertain in attendance, that acts like a fellow with the spring fever, let old Dr. Ridgway write you a prescription.", " \u201cNow, I want to propose two stunts: First, divide the Sunday School into four armies, depending on age. Everybody gets a military rank in his own army according to how many members he brings in, and the duffers that lie down on us and don't bring in any, they remain privates. The pastor and superintendent rank as generals. And everybody has got to give salutes and all the rest of that junk, just like a regular army, to make 'em feel it's worth while to get rank. \u201cThen, second: Course the school has its advertising committee, but, Lord, nobody ever really works good--nobody works well just for the love of it. The thing to do is to be practical and up-to-date, and hire a real paid press-agent for the Sunday School-some newspaper fellow who can give part of his time.\u201d \u201cSure, you bet!\u201d said Chum Frink. \u201cThink of the nice juicy bits he could get in!\u201d Babbitt crowed. \u201cNot only the big, salient, vital facts, about how fast the Sunday School--and the collection--is growing, but a lot of humorous gossip and kidding: about how some blowhard fell down on his pledge to get new members, or the good time the Sacred Trinity class of girls had at their wieniewurst party.", " What Babbitt saw, however, was the First Congregational Church of Catawba. He was back in the Sunday School of his boyhood. He smelled again that polite stuffiness to be found only in church parlors; he recalled the case of drab Sunday School books: \u201cHetty, a Humble Heroine\u201d and \u201cJosephus, a Lad of Palestine;\u201d he thumbed once more the high-colored text-cards which no boy wanted but no boy liked to throw away, because they were somehow sacred; he was tortured by the stumbling rote of thirty-five years ago, as in the vast Zenith church he listened to: \u201cNow, Edgar, you read the next verse. What does it mean when it says it's easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye? What does this teach us? Clarence! Please don't wiggle so! If you had studied your lesson you wouldn't be so fidgety. Now, Earl, what is the lesson Jesus was trying to teach his disciples? The one thing I want you to especially remember, boys, is the words, 'With God all things are possible.'", " I'm not sure, my boy, but what if you put it off it'll be too late. I'm not sure we'll want you then. Better think quick--better think quick!\u201d The three Vigilantes, formidable in their righteousness, stared at him in a taut silence. Babbitt waited through. He thought nothing at all, he merely waited, while in his echoing head buzzed, \u201cI don't want to join--I don't want to join--I don't want to.\u201d \u201cAll right. Sorry for you!\u201d said Colonel Snow, and the three men abruptly turned their beefy backs. IV As Babbitt went out to his car that evening he saw Vergil Gunch coming down the block. He raised his hand in salutation, but Gunch ignored it and crossed the street. He was certain that Gunch had seen him. He drove home in sharp discomfort. His wife attacked at once: \u201cGeorgie dear, Muriel Frink was in this afternoon, and she says that Chum says the committee of this Good Citizens' League especially asked you to join and you wouldn't."], "What does Seneca Doane dislike about Zenith?": [" \u201cBut I'm going to--oh, I'm going to start something!\u201d he vowed, and he tried to make it valiant. CHAPTER XXVI I As he walked through the train, looking for familiar faces, he saw only one person whom he knew, and that was Seneca Doane, the lawyer who, after the blessings of being in Babbitt's own class at college and of becoming a corporation-counsel, had turned crank, had headed farmer-labor tickets and fraternized with admitted socialists. Though he was in rebellion, naturally Babbitt did not care to be seen talking with such a fanatic, but in all the Pullmans he could find no other acquaintance, and reluctantly he halted. Seneca Doane was a slight, thin-haired man, rather like Chum Frink except that he hadn't Frink's grin. He was reading a book called \u201cThe Way of All Flesh.\u201d It looked religious to Babbitt, and he wondered if Doane could possibly have been converted and turned decent and patriotic.", " He fumbled: \u201cI suppose you'd especially light on fellows like Seneca Doane and try to make 'em--\u201d \u201cYou bet your sweet life we would! Look here, old Georgie: I've never for one moment believed you meant it when you've defended Doane, and the strikers and so on, at the Club. I knew you were simply kidding those poor galoots like Sid Finkelstein.... At least I certainly hope you were kidding!\u201d \u201cOh, well--sure--Course you might say--\u201d Babbitt was conscious of how feeble he sounded, conscious of Gunch's mature and relentless eye. \u201cGosh, you know where I stand! I'm no labor agitator! I'm a business man, first, last, and all the time! But--but honestly, I don't think Doane means so badly, and you got to remember he's an old friend of mine.\u201d \u201cGeorge, when it comes right down to a struggle between decency and the security of our homes on the one hand, and red ruin and those lazy dogs plotting for free beer on the other, you got to give up even old friendships.", " \u201cI'd like to know how it hasn't!

Doane looked up. His voice was curiously kind. \u201cOh! How do, Babbitt.\u201d \u201cBeen away, eh?\u201d \u201cYes, I've been in Washington.\u201d \u201cWashington, eh?

I was, uh--Sorry you didn't turn up at the last class-dinner.\u201d \u201cOh--thanks.\u201d \u201cHow's the unions coming? Going to run for mayor again?\u201d Doane seemed restless. He was fingering the pages of his book. He said \u201cI might\u201d as though it didn't mean anything in particular, and he smiled. Babbitt liked that smile, and hunted for conversation: \u201cSaw a bang-up cabaret in New York: the 'Good-Morning Cutie' bunch at the Hotel Minton.\u201d \u201cYes, they're pretty girls. I danced there one evening.\u201d \u201cOh. Like dancing?\u201d \u201cNaturally. I like dancing and pretty women and good food better than anything else in the world."], "Why does Babbitt value a college education?": [" \u201cI'd like to know how it hasn't!

The university was at Mohalis only fifteen miles from Zenith, and Ted often came down for the week-end. Babbitt was worried. Ted was \u201cgoing in for\u201d everything but books. He had tried to \u201cmake\u201d the football team as a light half-back, he was looking forward to the basket-ball season, he was on the committee for the Freshman Hop, and (as a Zenithite, an aristocrat among the yokels) he was being \u201crushed\u201d by two fraternities. But of his studies Babbitt could learn nothing save a mumbled, \u201cOh, gosh, these old stiffs of teachers just give you a lot of junk about literature and economics.\u201d One week-end Ted proposed, \u201cSay, Dad, why can't I transfer over from the College to the School of Engineering and take mechanical engineering? You always holler that I never study, but honest, I would study there.\u201d \u201cNo, the Engineering School hasn't got the standing the College has,\u201d fretted Babbitt.", " Lord, and Ted is just as bad! He wants to go to college, and he doesn't want to go to college. Only one of the three that knows her own mind is Tinka. Simply can't understand how I ever came to have a pair of shillyshallying children like Rone and Ted. I may not be any Rockefeller or James J. Shakespeare, but I certainly do know my own mind, and I do keep right on plugging along in the office and--Do you know the latest? Far as I can figure out, Ted's new bee is he'd like to be a movie actor and--And here I've told him a hundred times, if he'll go to college and law-school and make good, I'll set him up in business and--Verona just exactly as bad. Doesn't know what she wants. Well, well, come on! Aren't you ready yet? The girl rang the bell three minutes ago.\u201d V Before he followed his wife, Babbitt stood at the westernmost window of their room. This residential settlement, Floral Heights, was on a rise; and though the center of the city was three miles away--Zenith had between three and four hundred thousand inhabitants now--he could see the top of the Second National Tower, an Indiana limestone building of thirty-five stories."], "What do Babbitt and his friends think about Prohibition?": [" Ordinarily the men found it hard to talk to the women; flirtation was an art unknown on Floral Heights, and the realms of offices and of kitchens had no alliances. But under the inspiration of the cocktails, conversation was violent. Each of the men still had a number of important things to say about prohibition, and now that each had a loyal listener in his dinner-partner he burst out: \u201cI found a place where I can get all the hootch I want at eight a quart--\u201d \u201cDid you read about this fellow that went and paid a thousand dollars for ten cases of red-eye that proved to be nothing but water? Seems this fellow was standing on the corner and fellow comes up to him--\u201d \u201cThey say there's a whole raft of stuff being smuggled across at Detroit--\u201d \u201cWhat I always say is--what a lot of folks don't realize about prohibition--\u201d \u201cAnd then you get all this awful poison stuff--wood alcohol and everything--\u201d \u201cCourse I believe in it on principle, but I don't propose to have anybody telling me what I got to think and do.", " He was surprised and blasted then by a thought. He wondered whether Floral Heights dinners were worth the hideous toil involved. But he repented the sacrilege in the excitement of buying the materials for cocktails. Now this was the manner of obtaining alcohol under the reign of righteousness and prohibition: He drove from the severe rectangular streets of the modern business center into the tangled byways of Old Town--jagged blocks filled with sooty warehouses and lofts; on into The Arbor, once a pleasant orchard but now a morass of lodging-houses, tenements, and brothels. Exquisite shivers chilled his spine and stomach, and he looked at every policeman with intense innocence, as one who loved the law, and admired the Force, and longed to stop and play with them. He parked his car a block from Healey Hanson's saloon, worrying, \u201cWell, rats, if anybody did see me, they'd think I was here on business.\u201d He entered a place curiously like the saloons of ante-prohibition days, with a long greasy bar with sawdust in front and streaky mirror behind, a pine table at which a dirty old man dreamed over a glass of something which resembled whisky, and with two men at the bar, drinking something which resembled beer, and giving that impression of forming a large crowd which two men always give in a saloon.", " Slewing round a corner came a less cautious car. It skidded, it almost raked them with its rear fenders. In relief at their escape the Bunch--Tanis, Minnie Sonntag, Pete, Fulton Bemis--shouted \u201cOh, baby,\u201d and waved their hands to the agitated other driver. Then Babbitt saw Professor Pumphrey laboriously crawling up hill, afoot, Staring owlishly at the revelers. He was sure that Pumphrey recognized him and saw Tanis kiss him as she crowed, \u201cYou're such a good driver!\u201d At lunch next day he probed Pumphrey with \u201cOut last night with my brother and some friends of his. Gosh, what driving! Slippery 's glass. Thought I saw you hiking up the Bellevue Avenue Hill.\u201d \u201cNo, I wasn't--I didn't see you,\u201d said Pumphrey, hastily, rather guiltily. Perhaps two days afterward Babbitt took Tanis to lunch at the Hotel Thornleigh. She who had seemed well content to wait for him at her flat had begun to hint with melancholy smiles that he must think but little of her if he never introduced her to his friends, if he was unwilling to be seen with her except at the movies.", " I'll never miss their poison booze, whilst I the bubbling spring can use, that leaves my head at merry morn as clear as any babe new-born!\u201d Babbitt drank with the others; his moment's depression was gone; he perceived that these were the best fellows in the world; he wanted to give them a thousand cocktails. \u201cThink you could stand another?\u201d he cried. The wives refused, with giggles, but the men, speaking in a wide, elaborate, enjoyable manner, gloated, \u201cWell, sooner than have you get sore at me, Georgie--\u201d \u201cYou got a little dividend coming,\u201d said Babbitt to each of them, and each intoned, \u201cSqueeze it, Georgie, squeeze it!\u201d When, beyond hope, the pitcher was empty, they stood and talked about prohibition.

Paul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell, admitted Babbitt, and left them together. He spoke slowly: \u201cGo on! Be moral!\u201d Babbitt plumped on the couch beside him. \u201cI'm not going to be moral! I don't care what happened! I just want to do anything I can. I'm glad Zilla got what was coming to her.\u201d Paul said argumentatively, \u201cNow, don't go jumping on Zilla. I've been thinking; maybe she hasn't had any too easy a time. Just after I shot her--I didn't hardly mean to, but she got to deviling me so I went crazy, just for a second, and pulled out that old revolver you and I used to shoot rabbits with, and took a crack at her.", " Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried, \u201cSee you later, boys,\u201d and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then, neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference, nor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic Club. He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him, admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women. Paul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had been parted three years, not three days--and they said: \u201cHow's the old horse-thief?\u201d \u201cAll right, I guess. How're you, you poor shrimp?\u201d \u201cI'm first-rate, you second-hand hunk o' cheese.\u201d Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, \u201cYou're a fine guy, you are!

Of course by-and-by--\u201d There was no by-and-by, yet his belief that he had crushed the unclean habit made him feel noble and very happy. When he called up Paul Riesling he was, in his moral splendor, unusually eager. He was fonder of Paul Riesling than of any one on earth except himself and his daughter Tinka. They had been classmates, roommates, in the State University, but always he thought of Paul Riesling, with his dark slimness, his precisely parted hair, his nose-glasses, his hesitant speech, his moodiness, his love of music, as a younger brother, to be petted and protected."], "What did Babbitt want to do when he was young?": [" How about it?

Sorry for you!\u201d said Colonel Snow, and the three men abruptly turned their beefy backs. IV As Babbitt went out to his car that evening he saw Vergil Gunch coming down the block. He raised his hand in salutation, but Gunch ignored it and crossed the street. He was certain that Gunch had seen him. He drove home in sharp discomfort. His wife attacked at once: \u201cGeorgie dear, Muriel Frink was in this afternoon, and she says that Chum says the committee of this Good Citizens' League especially asked you to join and you wouldn't.", " The worst thing about these fellows is that they're so good and, in their work at least, so intelligent.

Offutt suggested, \u201cThe thing to do is to get your fool son-in-law, Babbitt, to put it over."], "Why did Babbitt marry Myra?": [" Where Zilla mocked him as a country boy, Myra said indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young dandies who had been born in the great city of Zenith--an ancient settlement in 1897, one hundred and five years old, with two hundred thousand population, the queen and wonder of all the state and, to the Catawba boy, George Babbitt, so vast and thunderous and luxurious that he was flattered to know a girl ennobled by birth in Zenith. Of love there was no talk between them. He knew that if he was to study law he could not marry for years; and Myra was distinctly a Nice Girl--one didn't kiss her, one didn't \u201cthink about her that way at all\u201d unless one was going to marry her. But she was a dependable companion. She was always ready to go skating, walking; always content to hear his discourses on the great things he was going to do, the distressed poor whom he would defend against the Unjust Rich, the speeches he would make at Banquets, the inexactitudes of popular thought which he would correct.", " \u201cIs that you, thin, owld one? Gee, Ma certainly is on the warpath! I told her Rone and I would jus' soon not be let in on the fiesta to-night, and she bit me. She says I got to take a bath, too. But, say, the Babbitt men will be some lookers to-night! Little Theodore in a dress-suit!\u201d \u201cThe Babbitt men!\u201d Babbitt liked the sound of it. He put his arm about the boy's shoulder. He wished that Paul Riesling had a daughter, so that Ted might marry her. \u201cYes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all right,\u201d he said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and dutifully went in to dress. The McKelveys were less than fifteen minutes late. Babbitt hoped that the Doppelbraus would see the McKelveys' limousine, and their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front. The dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and Mrs. Babbitt had brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. Babbitt worked hard.", " Nor was it at all evident to his acquaintances that there was a new George F. Babbitt, save that he was more irritable under the incessant chaffing at the Athletic Club, and once, when Vergil Gunch observed that Seneca Doane ought to be hanged, Babbitt snorted, \u201cOh, rats, he's not so bad.\u201d At home he grunted \u201cEh?\u201d across the newspaper to his commentatory wife, and was delighted by Tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, \u201cNo class to that corrugated iron garage. Have to build me a nice frame one.\u201d Verona and Kenneth Escott appeared really to be engaged. In his newspaper Escott had conducted a pure-food crusade against commission-houses.

He was a natural mechanic, a maker and tinkerer of machines; he lisped in blueprints for the blueprints came. \u201cThat'll do now!\u201d Babbitt flung in mechanically, as he lighted the gloriously satisfying first cigar of the day and tasted the exhilarating drug of the Advocate-Times headlines."], "What is the purpose of the Good Citizen's League?": [" Don't you think it would be better?

Oh, Myra, please quit nagging me about it.", " He patted Gunch's shoulder, and next day he became a member of the Good Citizens' League. Within two weeks no one in the League was more violent regarding the wickedness of Seneca Doane, the crimes of labor unions, the perils of immigration, and the delights of golf, morality, and bank-accounts than was George F. Babbitt. CHAPTER XXXIV I THE Good Citizens' League had spread through the country, but nowhere was it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of Zenith, commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants, most of which--though not all--lay inland, against a background of cornfields and mines and of small towns which depended upon them for mortgage-loans, table-manners, art, social philosophy and millinery. To the League belonged most of the prosperous citizens of Zenith. They were not all of the kind who called themselves \u201cRegular Guys.\u201d Besides these hearty fellows, these salesmen of prosperity, there were the aristocrats, that is, the men who were richer or had been rich for more generations: the presidents of banks and of factories, the land-owners, the corporation lawyers, the fashionable doctors, and the few young-old men who worked not at all but, reluctantly remaining in Zenith, collected luster-ware and first editions as though they were back in Paris.", " In their whelming presence Babbitt felt small and insignificant. \u201cWell, well, great pleasure, have chairs, what c'n I do for you?\u201d he babbled. They neither sat nor offered observations on the weather. \u201cBabbitt,\u201d said Colonel Snow, \u201cwe've come from the Good Citizens' League. We've decided we want you to join. Vergil Gunch says you don't care to, but I think we can show you a new light. The League is going to combine with the Chamber of Commerce in a campaign for the Open Shop, so it's time for you to put your name down.\u201d In his embarrassment Babbitt could not recall his reasons for not wishing to join the League, if indeed he had ever definitely known them, but he was passionately certain that he did not wish to join, and at the thought of their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even these princes of commerce. \u201cSorry, Colonel, have to think it over a little,\u201d he mumbled. McKelvey snarled, \u201cThat means you're not going to join, George?\u201d Something black and unfamiliar and ferocious spoke from Babbitt: \u201cNow, you look here, Charley!", " At four o'clock Vergil Gunch called on him. Babbitt was agitated, but Gunch began in a friendly way: \u201cHow's the boy? Say, some of us are getting up a scheme we'd kind of like to have you come in on.\u201d \u201cFine, Verg. Shoot.\u201d \u201cYou know during the war we had the Undesirable Element, the Reds and walking delegates and just the plain common grouches, dead to rights, and so did we for quite a while after the war, but folks forget about the danger and that gives these cranks a chance to begin working underground again, especially a lot of these parlor socialists. Well, it's up to the folks that do a little sound thinking to make a conscious effort to keep bucking these fellows. Some guy back East has organized a society called the Good Citizens' League for just that purpose. Of course the Chamber of Commerce and the American Legion and so on do a fine work in keeping the decent people in the saddle, but they're devoted to so many other causes that they can't attend to this one problem properly."], "How would Sir Gerald Doak best be described?": [" IV For a month they watched the social columns, and waited for a return dinner-invitation. As the hosts of Sir Gerald Doak, the McKelveys were headlined all the week after the Babbitts' dinner. Zenith ardently received Sir Gerald (who had come to America to buy coal). The newspapers interviewed him on prohibition, Ireland, unemployment, naval aviation, the rate of exchange, tea-drinking versus whisky-drinking, the psychology of American women, and daily life as lived by English county families. Sir Gerald seemed to have heard of all those topics. The McKelveys gave him a Singhalese dinner, and Miss Elnora Pearl Bates, society editor of the Advocate-Times, rose to her highest lark-note. Babbitt read aloud at breakfast-table: 'Twixt the original and Oriental decorations, the strange and delicious food, and the personalities both of the distinguished guests, the charming hostess and the noted host, never has Zenith seen a more recherche affair than the Ceylon dinner-dance given last evening by Mr. and Mrs. Charles McKelvey to Sir Gerald Doak.", " He seemed kind and insignificant, and as lonely as Babbitt himself. He wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange tie. It came to Babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash. The melancholy stranger was Sir Gerald Doak. Instinctively Babbitt rose, bumbling, \u201cHow 're you, Sir Gerald? 'Member we met in Zenith, at Charley McKelvey's? Babbitt's my name--real estate.\u201d \u201cOh! How d' you do.\u201d Sir Gerald shook hands flabbily. Embarrassed, standing, wondering how he could retreat, Babbitt maundered, \u201cWell, I suppose you been having a great trip since we saw you in Zenith.\u201d \u201cQuite. British Columbia and California and all over the place,\u201d he said doubtfully, looking at Babbitt lifelessly. \u201cHow did you find business conditions in British Columbia? Or I suppose maybe you didn't look into 'em. Scenery and sport and so on?\u201d \u201cScenery? Oh, capital. But business conditions--You know, Mr. Babbitt, they're having almost as much unemployment as we are.\u201d Sir Gerald was speaking warmly now.", " The lovely Mrs. McKelvey never was more fascinating than last evening in her black net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver and at her exquisite waist a glowing cluster of Aaron Ward roses. Babbitt said bravely, \u201cI hope they don't invite us to meet this Lord Doak guy. Darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with Charley and the Missus.\u201d At the Zenith Athletic Club they discussed it amply. \u201cI s'pose we'll have to call McKelvey 'Lord Chaz' from now on,\u201d said Sidney Finkelstein. \u201cIt beats all get-out,\u201d meditated that man of data, Howard Littlefield, \u201chow hard it is for some people to get things straight. Here they call this fellow 'Lord Doak' when it ought to be 'Sir Gerald. '\u201d Babbitt marvelled, \u201cIs that a fact! Well, well! 'Sir Gerald,' eh? That's what you call um, eh? Well, sir, I'm glad to know that.\u201d Later he informed his salesmen, \u201cIt's funnier 'n a goat the way some folks that, just because they happen to lay up a big wad, go entertaining famous foreigners, don't have any more idea 'n a rabbit how to address 'em so's to make 'em feel at home!\u201d That evening, as he was driving home, he passed McKelvey's limousine and saw Sir Gerald, a large, ruddy, pop-eyed, Teutonic Englishman whose dribble of yellow mustache gave him an aspect sad and doubtful.", " Sir Gerald's room was, except for his ponderous and durable English bags, very much like the room of George F. Babbitt; and quite in the manner of Babbitt he disclosed a huge whisky flask, looked proud and hospitable, and chuckled, \u201cSay, when, old chap.\u201d It was after the third drink that Sir Gerald proclaimed, \u201cHow do you Yankees get the notion that writing chaps like Bertrand Shaw and this Wells represent us? The real business England, we think those chaps are traitors. Both our countries have their comic Old Aristocracy--you know, old county families, hunting people and all that sort of thing--and we both have our wretched labor leaders, but we both have a backbone of sound business men who run the whole show.\u201d \u201cYou bet. Here's to the real guys!\u201d \u201cI'm with you! Here's to ourselves!\u201d It was after the fourth drink that Sir Gerald asked humbly, \u201cWhat do you think of North Dakota mortgages?\u201d but it was not till after the fifth that Babbitt began to call him \u201cJerry,\u201d and Sir Gerald confided, \u201cI say, do you mind if I pull off my boots?\u201d and ecstatically stretched his knightly feet, his poor, tired, hot, swollen feet out on the bed."], "What happens after Riesling shoots Zilla during an argument?": [" He mentioned his friends, Lord Wycombe, Colonel Wedgwood, Professor Piccoli. Babbitt had always supposed that Doane associated only with the I. W. W., but now he nodded gravely, as one who knew Lord Wycombes by the score, and he got in two references to Sir Gerald Doak. He felt daring and idealistic and cosmopolitan. Suddenly, in his new spiritual grandeur, he was sorry for Zilla Riesling, and understood her as these ordinary fellows at the Boosters' Club never could. II Five hours after he had arrived in Zenith and told his wife how hot it was in New York, he went to call on Zilla. He was buzzing with ideas and forgiveness. He'd get Paul released; he'd do things, vague but highly benevolent things, for Zilla; he'd be as generous as his friend Seneca Doane. He had not seen Zilla since Paul had shot her, and he still pictured her as buxom, high-colored, lively, and a little blowsy. As he drove up to her boarding-house, in a depressing back street below the wholesale district, he stopped in discomfort.", " \u201cYes?\u201d she said. \u201cWell, well, old Zilla! By golly, it's good to see you again!\u201d \u201cHe can send his messages through a lawyer.\u201d \u201cWhy, rats, Zilla, I didn't come just because of him. Came as an old friend.\u201d \u201cYou waited long enough!\u201d \u201cWell, you know how it is. Figured you wouldn't want to see a friend of his for quite some time and--Sit down, honey! Let's be sensible. We've all of us done a bunch of things that we hadn't ought to, but maybe we can sort of start over again. Honest, Zilla, I'd like to do something to make you both happy. Know what I thought to-day? Mind you, Paul doesn't know a thing about this--doesn't know I was going to come see you. I got to thinking: Zilla's a fine? big-hearted woman, and she'll understand that, uh, Paul's had his lesson now. Why wouldn't it be a fine idea if you asked the governor to pardon him? Believe he would, if it came from you. No! Wait! Just think how good you'd feel if you were generous.\u201d \u201cYes, I wish to be generous.\u201d She was sitting primly, speaking icily.", " Many members of the Athletic Club did go camping without their wives, but they were officially dedicated to fishing and hunting, whereas the sacred and unchangeable sports of Babbitt and Paul Riesling were golfing, motoring, and bridge. For either the fishermen or the golfers to have changed their habits would have been an infraction of their self-imposed discipline which would have shocked all right-thinking and regularized citizens. Babbitt blustered, \u201cWhy don't we just put our foot down and say, 'We're going on ahead of you, and that's all there is to it!' Nothing criminal in it. Simply say to Zilla--\u201d \u201cYou don't say anything to Zilla simply. Why, Georgie, she's almost as much of a moralist as you are, and if I told her the truth she'd believe we were going to meet some dames in New York. And even Myra--she never nags you, the way Zilla does, but she'd worry. She'd say, 'Don't you WANT me to go to Maine with you?", " \u201cI will say that, and I mean every single last word of it!\u201d \u201cOh, now, Zilla, the idea!\u201d Mrs. Babbitt was maternal and fussy. She was no older than Zilla, but she seemed so--at first. She was placid and puffy and mature, where Zilla, at forty-five, was so bleached and tight-corseted that you knew only that she was older than she looked. \u201cThe idea of talking to poor Paul like that!\u201d \u201cPoor Paul is right! We'd both be poor, we'd be in the poorhouse, if I didn't jazz him up!\u201d \u201cWhy, now, Zilla, Georgie and I were just saying how hard Paul's been working all year, and we were thinking it would be lovely if the Boys could run off by themselves. I've been coaxing George to go up to Maine ahead of the rest of us, and get the tired out of his system before we come, and I think it would be lovely if Paul could manage to get away and join him.\u201d At this exposure of his plot to escape, Paul was startled out of impassivity."], "How would Tanis' bohemian friends best be described?": [" \u201cGood Lord, Tinka is the only real friend I have, these days,\u201d he sighed, and he clung to the child, played floor-games with her all evening. He considered going to see Paul in prison, but, though he had a pale curt note from him every week, he thought of Paul as dead. It was Tanis for whom he was longing. \u201cI thought I was so smart and independent, cutting Tanis out, and I need her, Lord how I need her!\u201d he raged. \u201cMyra simply can't understand. All she sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. But Tanis, she'd tell me I was all right.\u201d Then he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to Tanis. He had not dared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. Only she wasn't Tanis. She was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like Tanis. She said, \u201cYes, George, what is it?\u201d in even and uninterested tones, and he crept away, whipped. His first comfort was from Ted and Eunice Littlefield.", " Oh, it was per-fect-ly priceless!\u201d \u201cOh, but wasn't T. D. stewed! Say, he was simply ossified! What did Gladys say to him?\u201d \u201cThink of the nerve of Bob Bickerstaff trying to get us to come to his house! Say, the nerve of him! Can you beat it for nerve? Some nerve I call it!\u201d \u201cDid you notice how Dotty was dancing? Gee, wasn't she the limit!\u201d Babbitt was to be heard sonorously agreeing with the once-hated Miss Minnie Sonntag that persons who let a night go by without dancing to jazz music were crabs, pikers, and poor fish; and he roared \u201cYou bet!\u201d when Mrs. Carrie Nork gurgled, \u201cDon't you love to sit on the floor? It's so Bohemian!\u201d He began to think extremely well of the Bunch. When he mentioned his friends Sir Gerald Doak, Lord Wycombe, William Washington Eathorne, and Chum Frink, he was proud of their condescending interest. He got so thoroughly into the jocund spirit that he didn't much mind seeing Tanis drooping against the shoulder of the youngest and milkiest of the young men, and he himself desired to hold Carrie Nork's pulpy hand, and dropped it only because Tanis looked angry.", " Slewing round a corner came a less cautious car. It skidded, it almost raked them with its rear fenders. In relief at their escape the Bunch--Tanis, Minnie Sonntag, Pete, Fulton Bemis--shouted \u201cOh, baby,\u201d and waved their hands to the agitated other driver. Then Babbitt saw Professor Pumphrey laboriously crawling up hill, afoot, Staring owlishly at the revelers. He was sure that Pumphrey recognized him and saw Tanis kiss him as she crowed, \u201cYou're such a good driver!\u201d At lunch next day he probed Pumphrey with \u201cOut last night with my brother and some friends of his. Gosh, what driving! Slippery 's glass. Thought I saw you hiking up the Bellevue Avenue Hill.\u201d \u201cNo, I wasn't--I didn't see you,\u201d said Pumphrey, hastily, rather guiltily. Perhaps two days afterward Babbitt took Tanis to lunch at the Hotel Thornleigh. She who had seemed well content to wait for him at her flat had begun to hint with melancholy smiles that he must think but little of her if he never introduced her to his friends, if he was unwilling to be seen with her except at the movies.", " He had met Tanis's friends; he had, with the ardent haste of the Midnight People, who drink and dance and rattle and are ever afraid to be silent, been adopted as a member of her group, which they called \u201cThe Bunch.\u201d He first met them after a day when he had worked particularly hard and when he hoped to be quiet with Tanis and slowly sip her admiration. From down the hall he could hear shrieks and the grind of a phonograph. As Tanis opened the door he saw fantastic figures dancing in a haze of cigarette smoke. The tables and chairs were against the wall. \u201cOh, isn't this dandy!\u201d she gabbled at him. \u201cCarrie Nork had the loveliest idea. She decided it was time for a party, and she 'phoned the Bunch and told 'em to gather round. . . . George, this is Carrie.\u201d \u201cCarrie\u201d was, in the less desirable aspects of both, at once matronly and spinsterish. She was perhaps forty; her hair was an unconvincing ash-blond; and if her chest was flat, her hips were ponderous."], "Why does Babbitt end his affair with Tanis?": [" \u201cGood Lord, Tinka is the only real friend I have, these days,\u201d he sighed, and he clung to the child, played floor-games with her all evening. He considered going to see Paul in prison, but, though he had a pale curt note from him every week, he thought of Paul as dead. It was Tanis for whom he was longing. \u201cI thought I was so smart and independent, cutting Tanis out, and I need her, Lord how I need her!\u201d he raged. \u201cMyra simply can't understand. All she sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. But Tanis, she'd tell me I was all right.\u201d Then he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to Tanis. He had not dared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. Only she wasn't Tanis. She was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like Tanis. She said, \u201cYes, George, what is it?\u201d in even and uninterested tones, and he crept away, whipped. His first comfort was from Ted and Eunice Littlefield.", " He was afraid that they would be seen together. In Zenith it is impossible to lunch with a neighbor's wife without the fact being known, before nightfall, in every house in your circle. But Tanis was beautifully discreet. However appealingly she might turn to him when they were alone, she was gravely detached when they were abroad, and he hoped that she would be taken for a client. Orville Jones once saw them emerging from a movie theater, and Babbitt bumbled, \u201cLet me make you 'quainted with Mrs. Judique. Now here's a lady who knows the right broker to come to, Orvy!\u201d Mr. Jones, though he was a man censorious of morals and of laundry machinery, seemed satisfied. His predominant fear--not from any especial fondness for her but from the habit of propriety--was that his wife would learn of the affair. He was certain that she knew nothing specific about Tanis, but he was also certain that she suspected something indefinite.", " \u201cI'll tell you: I'll get Minnie Sonntag to drive down with you.\u201d Tanis was pointing to the thin, sarcastic young woman. Miss Sonntag greeted him with an astringent \u201cHow d'you do, Mr. Babbitt. Tanis tells me you're a very prominent man, and I'm honored by being allowed to drive with you. Of course I'm not accustomed to associating with society people like you, so I don't know how to act in such exalted circles!\u201d Thus Miss Sonntag talked all the way down to Healey Hanson's. To her jibes he wanted to reply \u201cOh, go to the devil!\u201d but he never quite nerved himself to that reasonable comment. He was resenting the existence of the whole Bunch. He had heard Tanis speak of \u201cdarling Carrie\u201d and \u201cMin Sonntag--she's so clever--you'll adore her,\u201d but they had never been real to him. He had pictured Tanis as living in a rose-tinted vacuum, waiting for him, free of all the complications of a Floral Heights.", " You're a regular bad one!\u201d The second evening, she groaned sleepily, \u201cGood heavens, are you going to be out every single night?\u201d The third evening, he didn't play poker. He was tired now in every cell. \u201cFunny! Vacation doesn't seem to have done me a bit of good,\u201d he lamented. \u201cPaul's frisky as a colt, but I swear, I'm crankier and nervouser than when I came up here.\u201d He had three weeks of Maine. At the end of the second week he began to feel calm, and interested in life. He planned an expedition to climb Sachem Mountain, and wanted to camp overnight at Box Car Pond. He was curiously weak, yet cheerful, as though he had cleansed his veins of poisonous energy and was filling them with wholesome blood. He ceased to be irritated by Ted's infatuation with a waitress (his seventh tragic affair this year); he played catch with Ted, and with pride taught him to cast a fly in the pine-shadowed silence of Skowtuit Pond."], "What crisis prompts Babbitt to return to his conventional middle-class lifestyle after a brief rebellion?": [" I shouldn't dream of going unless you wanted me;' and you'd give in to save her feelings. Oh, the devil! Let's have a shot at duck-pins.\u201d During the game of duck-pins, a juvenile form of bowling, Paul was silent. As they came down the steps of the club, not more than half an hour after the time at which Babbitt had sternly told Miss McGoun he would be back, Paul sighed, \u201cLook here, old man, oughtn't to talked about Zilla way I did.\u201d \u201cRats, old man, it lets off steam.\u201d \u201cOh, I know! After spending all noon sneering at the conventional stuff, I'm conventional enough to be ashamed of saving my life by busting out with my fool troubles!\u201d \u201cOld Paul, your nerves are kind of on the bum. I'm going to take you away. I'm going to rig this thing. I'm going to have an important deal in New York and--and sure, of course!--I'll need you to advise me on the roof of the building! And the ole deal will fall through, and there'll be nothing for us but to go on ahead to Maine.", " Why, he wondered, should he be in rebellion? What was it all about? \u201cWhy not be sensible; stop all this idiotic running around, and enjoy himself with his family, his business, the fellows at the club?\u201d What was he getting out of rebellion? Misery and shame--the shame of being treated as an offensive small boy by a ragamuffin like Ida Putiak! And yet--Always he came back to \u201cAnd yet.\u201d Whatever the misery, he could not regain contentment with a world which, once doubted, became absurd. Only, he assured himself, he was \u201cthrough with this chasing after girls.\u201d By noontime he was not so sure even of that. If in Miss McGoun, Louetta Swanson, and Ida he had failed to find the lady kind and lovely, it did not prove that she did not exist. He was hunted by the ancient thought that somewhere must exist the not impossible she who would understand him, value him, and make him happy. II Mrs. Babbitt returned in August.", " But just as often, when he heard the soft whispers enveloping him he wailed, \u201cGood Lord, what have I done? Just played with the Bunch, and called down Clarence Drum about being such a high-and-mighty sodger. Never catch ME criticizing people and trying to make them accept MY ideas!\u201d He could not stand the strain. Before long he admitted that he would like to flee back to the security of conformity, provided there was a decent and creditable way to return. But, stubbornly, he would not be forced back; he would not, he swore, \u201ceat dirt.\u201d Only in spirited engagements with his wife did these turbulent fears rise to the surface. She complained that he seemed nervous, that she couldn't understand why he did not want to \u201cdrop in at the Littlefields'\u201d for the evening. He tried, but he could not express to her the nebulous facts of his rebellion and punishment. And, with Paul and Tanis lost, he had no one to whom he could talk.", " It seemed to him that they were uneasy. They had been talking about him then? He was angry. He became belligerent. He not only defended Seneca Doane but even made fun of the Y. M. C. A. Vergil Gunch was rather brief in his answers. Afterward Babbitt was not angry. He was afraid. He did not go to the next lunch of the Boosters' Club but hid in a cheap restaurant, and, while he munched a ham-and-egg sandwich and sipped coffee from a cup on the arm of his chair, he worried. Four days later, when the Bunch were having one of their best parties, Babbitt drove them to the skating-rink which had been laid out on the Chaloosa River. After a thaw the streets had frozen in smooth ice. Down those wide endless streets the wind rattled between the rows of wooden houses, and the whole Bellevue district seemed a frontier town. Even with skid chains on all four wheels, Babbitt was afraid of sliding, and when he came to the long slide of a hill he crawled down, both brakes on."], "How does Babbitt react to Ted's decision to elope and drop out of college?": [" This September Ted had entered the State University as a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences. The university was at Mohalis only fifteen miles from Zenith, and Ted often came down for the week-end. Babbitt was worried. Ted was \u201cgoing in for\u201d everything but books. He had tried to \u201cmake\u201d the football team as a light half-back, he was looking forward to the basket-ball season, he was on the committee for the Freshman Hop, and (as a Zenithite, an aristocrat among the yokels) he was being \u201crushed\u201d by two fraternities. But of his studies Babbitt could learn nothing save a mumbled, \u201cOh, gosh, these old stiffs of teachers just give you a lot of junk about literature and economics.\u201d One week-end Ted proposed, \u201cSay, Dad, why can't I transfer over from the College to the School of Engineering and take mechanical engineering? You always holler that I never study, but honest, I would study there.\u201d \u201cNo, the Engineering School hasn't got the standing the College has,\u201d fretted Babbitt.", " Lord, and Ted is just as bad! He wants to go to college, and he doesn't want to go to college. Only one of the three that knows her own mind is Tinka. Simply can't understand how I ever came to have a pair of shillyshallying children like Rone and Ted. I may not be any Rockefeller or James J. Shakespeare, but I certainly do know my own mind, and I do keep right on plugging along in the office and--Do you know the latest? Far as I can figure out, Ted's new bee is he'd like to be a movie actor and--And here I've told him a hundred times, if he'll go to college and law-school and make good, I'll set him up in business and--Verona just exactly as bad. Doesn't know what she wants. Well, well, come on! Aren't you ready yet? The girl rang the bell three minutes ago.\u201d V Before he followed his wife, Babbitt stood at the westernmost window of their room. This residential settlement, Floral Heights, was on a rise; and though the center of the city was three miles away--Zenith had between three and four hundred thousand inhabitants now--he could see the top of the Second National Tower, an Indiana limestone building of thirty-five stories.", " He proposed to his family, \u201cLook here, folks! Do you know who's going to trot up to Chicago for a couple of days--just week-end; won't lose but one day of school--know who's going with that celebrated business-ambassador, George F. Babbitt? Why, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt Babbitt!\u201d \u201cHurray!\u201d Ted shouted, and \u201cOh, maybe the Babbitt men won't paint that lil ole town red!\u201d And, once away from the familiar implications of home, they were two men together. Ted was young only in his assumption of oldness, and the only realms, apparently, in which Babbitt had a larger and more grown-up knowledge than Ted's were the details of real estate and the phrases of politics. When the other sages of the Pullman smoking-compartment had left them to themselves, Babbitt's voice did not drop into the playful and otherwise offensive tone in which one addresses children but continued its overwhelming and monotonous rumble, and Ted tried to imitate it in his strident tenor: \u201cGee, dad, you certainly did show up that poor boot when he got flip about the League of Nations!\u201d \u201cWell, the trouble with a lot of these fellows is, they simply don't know what they're talking about.", " Among the tremendous crises of each day none was more dramatic than starting the engine. It was slow on cold mornings; there was the long, anxious whirr of the starter; and sometimes he had to drip ether into the cocks of the cylinders, which was so very interesting that at lunch he would chronicle it drop by drop, and orally calculate how much each drop had cost him. This morning he was darkly prepared to find something wrong, and he felt belittled when the mixture exploded sweet and strong, and the car didn't even brush the door-jamb, gouged and splintery with many bruisings by fenders, as he backed out of the garage. He was confused. He shouted \u201cMorning!\u201d to Sam Doppelbrau with more cordiality than he had intended. Babbitt's green and white Dutch Colonial house was one of three in that block on Chatham Road. To the left of it was the residence of Mr. Samuel Doppelbrau, secretary of an excellent firm of bathroom-fixture jobbers."], "How is Babbitt changed after he returns to his conventional, middle-class life?": [" I shouldn't dream of going unless you wanted me;' and you'd give in to save her feelings.

But there wouldn't be any class to saying 'I got the degree of Stamp-licker from the Bezuzus Mail-order University!' You see--My dad was a pretty good old coot, but he never had much style to him, and I had to work darn hard to earn my way through college. Well, it's been worth it, to be able to associate with the finest gentlemen in Zenith, at the clubs and so on, and I wouldn't want you to drop out of the gentlemen class--the class that are just as red-blooded as the Common People but still have power and personality. It would kind of hurt me if you did that, old man!\u201d \u201cI know, Dad! Sure! All right. I'll stick to it. Say! Gosh! Gee whiz! I forgot all about those kids I was going to take to the chorus rehearsal. I'll have to duck!\u201d \u201cBut you haven't done all your home-work.\u201d \u201cDo it first thing in the morning.\u201d \u201cWell--\u201d Six times in the past sixty days Babbitt had stormed, \u201cYou will not 'do it first thing in the morning'!", " They shouted \u201cThat's the stuff!\u201d and in the discussion afterward they referred with impressiveness to \u201cour friend and brother, Mr. George F. Babbitt.\u201d He had in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as well known as that diplomat of business, Cecil Rountree. After the meeting, delegates from all over the state said, \u201cHower you, Brother Babbitt?\u201d Sixteen complete strangers called him \u201cGeorge,\u201d and three men took him into corners to confide, \u201cMighty glad you had the courage to stand up and give the Profession a real boost. Now I've always maintained--\u201d Next morning, with tremendous casualness, Babbitt asked the girl at the hotel news-stand for the newspapers from Zenith. There was nothing in the Press, but in the Advocate-Times, on the third page--He gasped. They had printed his picture and a half-column account. The heading was \u201cSensation at Annual Land-men's Convention.", " I'm right with you. It's a first-class place.\u201d \u201cYuh, but say, any of you fellows ever stay at the Rippleton, in Chicago? I don't want to knock--I believe in boosting wherever you can--but say, of all the rotten dumps that pass 'emselves off as first-class hotels, that's the worst. I'm going to get those guys, one of these days, and I told 'em so. You know how I am--well, maybe you don't know, but I'm accustomed to first-class accommodations, and I'm perfectly willing to pay a reasonable price. I got into Chicago late the other night, and the Rippleton's near the station--I'd never been there before, but I says to the taxi-driver--I always believe in taking a taxi when you get in late; may cost a little more money, but, gosh, it's worth it when you got to be up early next morning and out selling a lot of crabs--and I said to him, 'Oh, just drive me over to the Rippleton.' \u201cWell, we got there, and I breezed up to the desk and said to the clerk, 'Well, brother, got a nice room with bath for Cousin Bill?'"], "What city is Babbitt set in?": [" He regarded the corrugated iron garage. For the three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth time in a year he reflected, \u201cNo class to that tin shack. Have to build me a frame garage. But by golly it's the only thing on the place that isn't up-to-date!\u201d While he stared he thought of a community garage for his acreage development, Glen Oriole. He stopped puffing and jiggling. His arms were akimbo. His petulant, sleep-swollen face was set in harder lines. He suddenly seemed capable, an official, a man to contrive, to direct, to get things done. On the vigor of his idea he was carried down the hard, clean, unused-looking hall into the bathroom. Though the house was not large it had, like all houses on Floral Heights, an altogether royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed tile and metal sleek as silver. The towel-rack was a rod of clear glass set in nickel. The tub was long enough for a Prussian Guard, and above the set bowl was a sensational exhibit of tooth-brush holder, shaving-brush holder, soap-dish, sponge-dish, and medicine-cabinet, so glittering and so ingenious that they resembled an electrical instrument-board.", " But these small-town boobs, with nobody but each other to talk to, no wonder they get so sloppy and uncultured in their speech, and so balled-up in their thinking!\u201d Orville Jones commented, \u201cAnd, then take our other advantages--the movies, frinstance. These Yapville sports think they're all-get-out if they have one change of bill a week, where here in the city you got your choice of a dozen diff'rent movies any evening you want to name!\u201d \u201cSure, and the inspiration we get from rubbing up against high-class hustlers every day and getting jam full of ginger,\u201d said Eddie Swanson. \u201cSame time,\u201d said Babbitt, \u201cno sense excusing these rube burgs too easy. Fellow's own fault if he doesn't show the initiative to up and beat it to the city, like we done--did. And, just speaking in confidence among friends, they're jealous as the devil of a city man. Every time I go up to Catawba I have to go around apologizing to the fellows I was brought up with because I've more or less succeeded and they haven't.", " Neither Angus nor Maxwell belonged to the Elks or to the Athletic Club; neither of them had ever called Babbitt \u201cbrother\u201d or asked his opinions on carburetors. The only \u201chuman people\u201d whom she invited, Babbitt raged, were the Littlefields; and Howard Littlefield at times became so statistical that Babbitt longed for the refreshment of Gunch's, \u201cWell, old lemon-pie-face, what's the good word?\u201d Immediately after lunch Mrs. Babbitt began to set the table for the seven-thirty dinner to the McKelveys, and Babbitt was, by order, home at four. But they didn't find anything for him to do, and three times Mrs. Babbitt scolded, \u201cDo please try to keep out of the way!\u201d He stood in the door of the garage, his lips drooping, and wished that Littlefield or Sam Doppelbrau or somebody would come along and talk to him. He saw Ted sneaking about the corner of the house. \u201cWhat's the matter, old man?\u201d said Babbitt.", " He laid out a new fifteen-cent school exercise-book on his wife's collapsible sewing-table, set up for the event in the living-room. The household had been bullied into silence; Verona and Ted requested to disappear, and Tinka threatened with \u201cIf I hear one sound out of you--if you holler for a glass of water one single solitary time--You better not, that's all!\u201d Mrs. Babbitt sat over by the piano, making a nightgown and gazing with respect while Babbitt wrote in the exercise-book, to the rhythmical wiggling and squeaking of the sewing-table. When he rose, damp and jumpy, and his throat dusty from cigarettes, she marveled, \u201cI don't see how you can just sit down and make up things right out of your own head!\u201d \u201cOh, it's the training in constructive imagination that a fellow gets in modern business life.\u201d He had written seven pages, whereof the first page set forth: {illustration omitted: consists of several doodles and \u201c(1) a profession (2) Not just a trade crossed out (3) Skill & vision (3) Shd be called \u201crealtor\u201d & not just real est man\u201d} The other six pages were rather like the first."], "What does Babbitt frequently say he wants to quit?": [" Suppose Lucile McKelvey heard you calling it a 'Tux.

Ever since she got out of college she's been too rambunctious to live with--doesn't know what she wants--well, I know what she wants!--all she wants is to marry a millionaire, and live in Europe, and hold some preacher's hand, and simultaneously at the same time stay right here in Zenith and be some blooming kind of a socialist agitator or boss charity-worker or some damn thing!", " I mean--it's so lacking in refinement, but--And Mother wants to come and stay with me for a whole month, and of course I do love her, I suppose I do, but honestly, she'll cramp my style something dreadful--she never can learn not to comment, and she always wants to know where I'm going when I go out evenings, and if I lie to her she always spies around and ferrets around and finds out where I've been, and then she looks like Patience on a Monument till I could just scream. And oh, I MUST tell you--You know I never talk about myself; I just hate people who do, don't you? But--I feel so stupid to-night, and I know I must be boring you with all this but--What would you do about Mother?\u201d He gave her facile masculine advice. She was to put off her mother's stay. She was to tell Carrie to go to the deuce. For these valuable revelations she thanked him, and they ambled into the familiar gossip of the Bunch.", " They called for drinks till the manager insisted that the place was closed. All the while Babbitt felt a hot raw desire for more brutal amusements. When W. A. Rogers drawled, \u201cWhat say we go down the line and look over the girls?\u201d he agreed savagely. Before they went, three of them secretly made appointments with the professional dancing girl, who agreed \u201cYes, yes, sure, darling\u201d to everything they said, and amiably forgot them. As they drove back through the outskirts of Monarch, down streets of small brown wooden cottages of workmen, characterless as cells, as they rattled across warehouse-districts which by drunken night seemed vast and perilous, as they were borne toward the red lights and violent automatic pianos and the stocky women who simpered, Babbitt was frightened. He wanted to leap from the taxicab, but all his body was a murky fire, and he groaned, \u201cToo late to quit now,\u201d and knew that he did not want to quit.", " Lord, and Ted is just as bad!

Paul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell, admitted Babbitt, and left them together. He spoke slowly: \u201cGo on!

The McKelveys were less than fifteen minutes late. Babbitt hoped that the Doppelbraus would see the McKelveys' limousine, and their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front. The dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and Mrs. Babbitt had brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. Babbitt worked hard.", " The work of the world was being done. Lyte had made something over nine thousand dollars, Babbitt had made a four-hundred-and-fifty dollar commission, Purdy had, by the sensitive mechanism of modern finance, been provided with a business-building, and soon the happy inhabitants of Linton would have meat lavished upon them at prices only a little higher than those down-town. It had been a manly battle, but after it Babbitt drooped. This was the only really amusing contest he had been planning. There was nothing ahead save details of leases, appraisals, mortgages. He muttered, \u201cMakes me sick to think of Lyte carrying off most of the profit when I did all the work, the old skinflint! And--What else have I got to do to-day?... Like to take a good long vacation. Motor trip. Something.\u201d He sprang up, rekindled by the thought of lunching with Paul Riesling. CHAPTER V BABBITT'S preparations for leaving the office to its feeble self during the hour and a half of his lunch-period were somewhat less elaborate than the plans for a general European war.", " Oughtn't to get grouchy like I do. But--Wish I'd been a pioneer, same as my grand-dad. But then, wouldn't have a house like this. I--Oh, gosh, I DON'T KNOW!\u201d He thought moodily of Paul Riesling, of their youth together, of the girls they had known. When Babbitt had graduated from the State University, twenty-four years ago, he had intended to be a lawyer. He had been a ponderous debater in college; he felt that he was an orator; he saw himself becoming governor of the state. While he read law he worked as a real-estate salesman. He saved money, lived in a boarding-house, supped on poached egg on hash. The lively Paul Riesling (who was certainly going off to Europe to study violin, next month or next year) was his refuge till Paul was bespelled by Zilla Colbeck, who laughed and danced and drew men after her plump and gaily wagging finger. Babbitt's evenings were barren then, and he found comfort only in Paul's second cousin, Myra Thompson, a sleek and gentle girl who showed her capacity by agreeing with the ardent young Babbitt that of course he was going to be governor some day."], "What fantasy figure is Babbitt searching for?": [" The guests were Howard Littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who furnished publicity and comforting economics to the Street Traction Company; Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the Elks and in the Boosters' Club; Eddie Swanson the agent for the Javelin Motor Car, who lived across the street; and Orville Jones, owner of the Lily White Laundry, which justly announced itself \u201cthe biggest, busiest, bulliest cleanerie shoppe in Zenith.\u201d But, naturally, the most distinguished of all was T. Cholmondeley Frink, who was not only the author of \u201cPoemulations,\u201d which, syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading newspapers, gave him one of the largest audiences of any poet in the world, but also an optimistic lecturer and the creator of \u201cAds that Add.\u201d Despite the searching philosophy and high morality of his verses, they were humorous and easily understood by any child of twelve; and it added a neat air of pleasantry to them that they were set not as verse but as prose.", " There's MONEY in it, BIG money, and that rapid change of scene, that entrancing and compelling interest and fascination, which your active mind and adventurous spirit crave. Think of being the chief figure and directing factor in solving strange mysteries and baffling crimes. This wonderful profession brings you into contact with influential men on the basis of equality, and often calls upon you to travel everywhere, maybe to distant lands--all expenses paid. NO SPECIAL EDUCATION REQUIRED.\u201d \u201cOh, boy! I guess that wins the fire-brick necklace! Wouldn't it be swell to travel everywhere and nab some famous crook!\u201d whooped Ted. \u201cWell, I don't think much of that. Doggone likely to get hurt. Still, that music-study stunt might be pretty fair, though. There's no reason why, if efficiency-experts put their minds to it the way they have to routing products in a factory, they couldn't figure out some scheme so a person wouldn't have to monkey with all this practising and exercises that you get in music.\u201d Babbitt was impressed, and he had a delightful parental feeling that they two, the men of the family, understood each other.", " Ted, come into the dining-room and we'll talk this over.\u201d In the dining-room, the door firmly closed, Babbitt walked to his son, put both hands on his shoulders. \u201cYou're more or less right. They all talk too much. Now what do you plan to do, old man?\u201d \u201cGosh, dad, are you really going to be human?\u201d \u201cWell, I--Remember one time you called us 'the Babbitt men' and said we ought to stick together? I want to. I don't pretend to think this isn't serious. The way the cards are stacked against a young fellow to-day, I can't say I approve of early marriages. But you couldn't have married a better girl than Eunice; and way I figure it, Littlefield is darn lucky to get a Babbitt for a son-in-law! But what do you plan to do? Course you could go right ahead with the U., and when you'd finished--\u201d \u201cDad, I can't stand it any more. Maybe it's all right for some fellows. Maybe I'll want to go back some day.", " He's been out there all morning getting hot and dusty, and no wonder he wants to beat the tar out of those sons of guns!\u201d Gunch said nothing, and watched; and Babbitt knew that he was being watched. III As he was leaving the club Babbitt heard Chum Frink protesting to Gunch, \u201c--don't know what's got into him. Last Sunday Doc Drew preached a corking sermon about decency in business and Babbitt kicked about that, too. Near 's I can figure out--\u201d Babbitt was vaguely frightened. IV He saw a crowd listening to a man who was talking from the rostrum of a kitchen-chair. He stopped his car. From newspaper pictures he knew that the speaker must be the notorious freelance preacher, Beecher Ingram, of whom Seneca Doane had spoken. Ingram was a gaunt man with flamboyant hair, weather-beaten cheeks, and worried eyes. He was pleading: \u201c--if those telephone girls can hold out, living on one meal a day, doing their own washing, starving and smiling, you big hulking men ought to be able--\u201d Babbitt saw that from the sidewalk Vergil Gunch was watching him."], "What does Myra fall ill with?": [" They give away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman.\u201d Remembering Ida Putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him, Babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had used him, he told of Paul Riesling, of Zilla, of Seneca Doane, of the strike: \u201cSee how it was? Course I was as anxious to have those beggars licked to a standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their side. For a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal, don't you think so?\u201d \u201cOh, I do!\u201d Sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her hands beside her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of being appreciated he proclaimed: \u201cSo I up and said to the fellows at the club, 'Look here,' I--\u201d \u201cDo you belong to the Union Club? I think it's--\u201d \u201cNo; the Athletic. Tell you: Course they're always asking me to join the Union, but I always say, 'No, sir!", " \u201cI made out I hadn't heard them--sure! same as you wouldn't hear a boiler-factory!--and I tried to look away--I can tell you exactly how every tile looks in the ceiling of that lobby; there's one with brown spots on it like the face of the devil--and all the time the people there--they were packed in like sardines--they kept making remarks about us, and Zilla went right on talking about the little chap, and screeching that 'folks like him oughtn't to be admitted in a place that's SUPPOSED to be for ladies and gentlemen,' and 'Paul, will you kindly call the manager, so I can report this dirty rat?' and--Oof! Maybe I wasn't glad when I could sneak inside and hide in the dark! \u201cAfter twenty-four years of that kind of thing, you don't expect me to fall down and foam at the mouth when you hint that this sweet, clean, respectable, moral life isn't all it's cracked up to be, do you? I can't even talk about it, except to you, because anybody else would think I was yellow.", " But seriously, you don't realize what a famous man you are.\u201d \u201cWell--Though I haven't done much orating this fall. Too kind of bothered by this Paul Riesling business, I guess. But--Do you know, you're the first person that's really understood what I was getting at, Tanis--Listen to me, will you! Fat nerve I've got, calling you Tanis!\u201d \u201cOh, do! And shall I call you George? Don't you think it's awfully nice when two people have so much--what shall I call it?--so much analysis that they can discard all these stupid conventions and understand each other and become acquainted right away, like ships that pass in the night?\u201d \u201cI certainly do! I certainly do!\u201d He was no longer quiescent in his chair; he wandered about the room, he dropped on the couch beside her. But as he awkwardly stretched his hand toward her fragile, immaculate fingers, she said brightly, \u201cDo give me a cigarette. Would you think poor Tanis was dreadfully naughty if she smoked?\u201d \u201cLord, no!", " Why, I've never had anybody speak to me that way in all my life! I was so astonished I just turned to him and said--I thought there must be some mistake, and so I said to him, perfectly pleasant, 'Were you speaking to me?' and he went on and bellowed at me, 'Yes, I was! You're keeping the whole car from starting!' he said, and then I saw he was one of these dirty ill-bred hogs that kindness is wasted on, and so I stopped and looked right at him, and I said, 'I--beg--your--pardon, I am not doing anything of the kind,' I said, 'it's the people ahead of me, who won't move up,' I said, 'and furthermore, let me tell you, young man, that you're a low-down, foul-mouthed, impertinent skunk,' I said, 'and you're no gentleman! I certainly intend to report you, and we'll see,' I said, 'whether a lady is to be insulted by any drunken bum that chooses to put on a ragged uniform, and I'd thank you,' I said, 'to keep your filthy abuse to yourself.'"], "What is Babbitt\u2019s profession?": [" \u201cWell, if it would help you in making up the program--Tell you: the way I look at it is this: First place, we ought to insist that folks call us 'realtors' and not 'real-estate men.' Sounds more like a reg'lar profession. Second place--What is it distinguishes a profession from a mere trade, business, or occupation? What is it? Why, it's the public service and the skill, the trained skill, and the knowledge and, uh, all that, whereas a fellow that merely goes out for the jack, he never considers the-public service and trained skill and so on. Now as a professional--\u201d \u201cRather! That's perfectly bully! Perfectly corking! Now you write it in a paper,\u201d said Rountree, as he rapidly and firmly moved away. II However accustomed to the literary labors of advertisements and correspondence, Babbitt was dismayed on the evening when he sat down to prepare a paper which would take a whole ten minutes to read.", " They shouted \u201cThat's the stuff!\u201d and in the discussion afterward they referred with impressiveness to \u201cour friend and brother, Mr. George F. Babbitt.\u201d He had in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as well known as that diplomat of business, Cecil Rountree. After the meeting, delegates from all over the state said, \u201cHower you, Brother Babbitt?\u201d Sixteen complete strangers called him \u201cGeorge,\u201d and three men took him into corners to confide, \u201cMighty glad you had the courage to stand up and give the Profession a real boost. Now I've always maintained--\u201d Next morning, with tremendous casualness, Babbitt asked the girl at the hotel news-stand for the newspapers from Zenith. There was nothing in the Press, but in the Advocate-Times, on the third page--He gasped. They had printed his picture and a half-column account. The heading was \u201cSensation at Annual Land-men's Convention.", " She greeted Babbitt with a giggling \u201cWelcome to our little midst! Tanis says you're a real sport.\u201d He was apparently expected to dance, to be boyish and gay with Carrie, and he did his unforgiving best. He towed her about the room, bumping into other couples, into the radiator, into chair-legs cunningly ambushed. As he danced he surveyed the rest of the Bunch: A thin young woman who looked capable, conceited, and sarcastic. Another woman whom he could never quite remember. Three overdressed and slightly effeminate young men--soda-fountain clerks, or at least born for that profession. A man of his own age, immovable, self-satisfied, resentful of Babbitt's presence. When he had finished his dutiful dance Tanis took him aside and begged, \u201cDear, wouldn't you like to do something for me? I'm all out of booze, and the Bunch want to celebrate. Couldn't you just skip down to Healey Hanson's and get some?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d he said, trying not to sound sullen.", " How about it? What's your Ideal, anyway? Do you want to make money and be a responsible member of the community, or do you want to be a loafer, with no Inspiration or Pep?\u201d Graff was not so amenable to Vision and Ideals as usual. \u201cYou bet I want to make money! That's why I want that bonus! Honest, Mr. Babbitt, I don't want to get fresh, but this Heiler house is a terror. Nobody'll fall for it. The flooring is rotten and the walls are full of cracks.\u201d \u201cThat's exactly what I mean! To a salesman with a love for his profession, it's hard problems like that that inspire him to do his best. Besides, Stan--Matter o' fact, Thompson and I are against bonuses, as a matter of principle. We like you, and we want to help you so you can get married, but we can't be unfair to the others on the staff. If we start giving you bonuses, don't you see we're going to hurt the feeling and be unjust to Penniman and Laylock?"], "What two qualities describe Myra?": [" Where Zilla mocked him as a country boy, Myra said indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young dandies who had been born in the great city of Zenith--an ancient settlement in 1897, one hundred and five years old, with two hundred thousand population, the queen and wonder of all the state and, to the Catawba boy, George Babbitt, so vast and thunderous and luxurious that he was flattered to know a girl ennobled by birth in Zenith. Of love there was no talk between them. He knew that if he was to study law he could not marry for years; and Myra was distinctly a Nice Girl--one didn't kiss her, one didn't \u201cthink about her that way at all\u201d unless one was going to marry her. But she was a dependable companion. She was always ready to go skating, walking; always content to hear his discourses on the great things he was going to do, the distressed poor whom he would defend against the Unjust Rich, the speeches he would make at Banquets, the inexactitudes of popular thought which he would correct.", " He stared up at it, muttering, \u201cTwenty-two hundred rooms and twenty-two hundred baths! That's got everything in the world beat. Lord, their turnover must be--well, suppose price of rooms is four to eight dollars a day, and I suppose maybe some ten and--four times twenty-two hundred-say six times twenty-two hundred--well, anyway, with restaurants and everything, say summers between eight and fifteen thousand a day. Every day! I never thought I'd see a thing like that! Some town! Of course the average fellow in Zenith has got more Individual Initiative than the fourflushers here, but I got to hand it to New York. Yes, sir, town, you're all right--some ways. Well, old Paulski, I guess we've seen everything that's worth while. How'll we kill the rest of the time? Movie?\u201d But Paul desired to see a liner. \u201cAlways wanted to go to Europe--and, by thunder, I will, too, some day before I past out,\u201d he sighed.", " \u201cHe'd been a fool to lose her. He had to have somebody he could really talk to. He'd--oh, he'd BUST if he went on stewing about things by himself. And Myra, useless to expect her to understand. Well, rats, no use dodging the issue. Darn shame for two married people to drift apart after all these years; darn rotten shame; but nothing could bring them together now, as long as he refused to let Zenith bully him into taking orders--and he was by golly not going to let anybody bully him into anything, or wheedle him or coax him either!\u201d He woke at three, roused by a passing motor, and struggled out of bed for a drink of water. As he passed through the bedroom he heard his wife groan. His resentment was night-blurred; he was solicitous in inquiring, \u201cWhat's the trouble, hon?\u201d \u201cI've got--such a pain down here in my side--oh, it's just--it tears at me.\u201d \u201cBad indigestion? Shall I get you some bicarb?\u201d \u201cDon't think--that would help.", " \u201cMight as well go and get it over,\u201d Babbitt groaned to his wife. \u201cBut don't it simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn't know the first thing about social etiquette? Think of him 'phoning me, instead of his wife sitting down and writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we're stuck for it. That's the trouble with all this class-brother hooptedoodle.\u201d He accepted Overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for an evening two weeks off. A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester. It was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at six-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven. Babbitt permitted himself to be ten minutes late."], "Which character shoots his wife?": [" At night he lights up a good cigar, and climbs into the little old 'bus, and maybe cusses the carburetor, and shoots out home. He mows the lawn, or sneaks in some practice putting, and then he's ready for dinner. After dinner he tells the kiddies a story, or takes the family to the movies, or plays a few fists of bridge, or reads the evening paper, and a chapter or two of some good lively Western novel if he has a taste for literature, and maybe the folks next-door drop in and they sit and visit about their friends and the topics of the day. Then he goes happily to bed, his conscience clear, having contributed his mite to the prosperity of the city and to his own bank-account. \u201c'In politics and religion this Sane Citizen is the canniest man on earth; and in the arts he invariably has a natural taste which makes him pick out the best, every time. In no country in the world will you find so many reproductions of the Old Masters and of well-known paintings on parlor walls as in these United States.", " You cut your own nails, last time, didn't you!\u201d \u201cYe-es, guess I must 've.\u201d \u201cYou always ought to go to a manicure.\u201d \u201cYes, maybe that's so. I--\u201d \u201cThere's nothing looks so nice as nails that are looked after good. I always think that's the best way to spot a real gent. There was an auto salesman in here yesterday that claimed you could always tell a fellow's class by the car he drove, but I says to him, 'Don't be silly,' I says; 'the wisenheimers grab a look at a fellow's nails when they want to tell if he's a tin-horn or a real gent!\u201d' \u201cYes, maybe there's something to that. Course, that is--with a pretty kiddy like you, a man can't help coming to get his mitts done.\u201d \u201cYeh, I may be a kid, but I'm a wise bird, and I know nice folks when I see um--I can read character at a glance--and I'd never talk so frank with a fellow if I couldn't see he was a nice fellow.\u201d She smiled. Her eyes seemed to him as gentle as April pools.", " They ought to run him out of town! Why, he preaches--if you can call it preaching--in a theater, in the House of Satan! You don't know what it is to find God, to find peace, to behold the snares that the devil spreads out for our feet. Oh, I'm so glad to see the mysterious purposes of God in having Paul harm me and stop my wickedness--and Paul's getting his, good and plenty, for the cruel things he did to me, and I hope he DIES in prison!\u201d Babbitt was up, hat in hand, growling, \u201cWell, if that's what you call being at peace, for heaven's sake just warn me before you go to war, will you?\u201d III Vast is the power of cities to reclaim the wanderer. More than mountains or the shore-devouring sea, a city retains its character, imperturbable, cynical, holding behind apparent changes its essential purpose. Though Babbitt had deserted his family and dwelt with Joe Paradise in the wilderness, though he had become a liberal, though he had been quite sure, on the night before he reached Zenith, that neither he nor the city would be the same again, ten days after his return he could not believe that he had ever been away.", " To all this was added a nerve-jabbing quarrel with his secret associates in the deal. They did not wish Babbitt and Thompson to have any share in the deal except as brokers. Babbitt rather agreed. \u201cEthics of the business-broker ought to strictly represent his principles and not get in on the buying,\u201d he said to Thompson. \u201cEthics, rats! Think I'm going to see that bunch of holy grafters get away with the swag and us not climb in?\u201d snorted old Henry. \u201cWell, I don't like to do it. Kind of double-crossing.\u201d \u201cIt ain't. It's triple-crossing. It's the public that gets double-crossed. Well, now we've been ethical and got it out of our systems, the question is where we can raise a loan to handle some of the property for ourselves, on the Q. T. We can't go to our bank for it. Might come out.\u201d \u201cI could see old Eathorne. He's close as the tomb.\u201d \u201cThat's the stuff.\u201d Eathorne was glad, he said, to \u201cinvest in character,\u201d to make Babbitt the loan and see to it that the loan did not appear on the books of the bank."], "What is the name given to Tanis\u2019s Bohemian friends?": [" \u201cGood Lord, Tinka is the only real friend I have, these days,\u201d he sighed, and he clung to the child, played floor-games with her all evening. He considered going to see Paul in prison, but, though he had a pale curt note from him every week, he thought of Paul as dead. It was Tanis for whom he was longing. \u201cI thought I was so smart and independent, cutting Tanis out, and I need her, Lord how I need her!\u201d he raged. \u201cMyra simply can't understand. All she sees in life is getting along by being just like other folks. But Tanis, she'd tell me I was all right.\u201d Then he broke, and one evening, late, he did run to Tanis. He had not dared to hope for it, but she was in, and alone. Only she wasn't Tanis. She was a courteous, brow-lifting, ice-armored woman who looked like Tanis. She said, \u201cYes, George, what is it?\u201d in even and uninterested tones, and he crept away, whipped. His first comfort was from Ted and Eunice Littlefield.", " Oh, it was per-fect-ly priceless!\u201d \u201cOh, but wasn't T. D. stewed! Say, he was simply ossified! What did Gladys say to him?\u201d \u201cThink of the nerve of Bob Bickerstaff trying to get us to come to his house! Say, the nerve of him! Can you beat it for nerve? Some nerve I call it!\u201d \u201cDid you notice how Dotty was dancing? Gee, wasn't she the limit!\u201d Babbitt was to be heard sonorously agreeing with the once-hated Miss Minnie Sonntag that persons who let a night go by without dancing to jazz music were crabs, pikers, and poor fish; and he roared \u201cYou bet!\u201d when Mrs. Carrie Nork gurgled, \u201cDon't you love to sit on the floor? It's so Bohemian!\u201d He began to think extremely well of the Bunch. When he mentioned his friends Sir Gerald Doak, Lord Wycombe, William Washington Eathorne, and Chum Frink, he was proud of their condescending interest. He got so thoroughly into the jocund spirit that he didn't much mind seeing Tanis drooping against the shoulder of the youngest and milkiest of the young men, and he himself desired to hold Carrie Nork's pulpy hand, and dropped it only because Tanis looked angry.", " \u201cWhy haven't you called me up?\u201d Babbitt was asked accusingly, not only by Tanis and Carrie but presently by new ancient friends, Jennie and Capitolina and Toots. If for a moment he had seen Tanis as withering and sentimental, he lost that impression at Carrie Nork's dance. Mrs. Nork had a large house and a small husband. To her party came all of the Bunch, perhaps thirty-five of them when they were completely mobilized. Babbitt, under the name of \u201cOld Georgie,\u201d was now a pioneer of the Bunch, since each month it changed half its membership and he who could recall the prehistoric days of a fortnight ago, before Mrs. Absolom, the food-demonstrator, had gone to Indianapolis, and Mac had \u201cgot sore at\u201d Minnie, was a venerable leader and able to condescend to new Petes and Minnies and Gladyses. At Carrie's, Tanis did not have to work at being hostess. She was dignified and sure, a clear fine figure in the black chiffon frock he had always loved; and in the wider spaces of that ugly house Babbitt was able to sit quietly with her.", " He was uncomfortable with her successor, Miss Havstad. What Miss Havstad's given name was, no one in the office ever knew. It seemed improbable that she had a given name, a lover, a powder-puff, or a digestion. She was so impersonal, this slight, pale, industrious Swede, that it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat hash. She was a perfectly oiled and enameled machine, and she ought, each evening, to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her too-slim, too-frail pencil points. She took dictation swiftly, her typing was perfect, but Babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with her. She made him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved daily jokes she looked gently inquiring. He longed for Miss McGoun's return, and thought of writing to her. Then he heard that Miss McGoun had, a week after leaving him, gone over to his dangerous competitors, Sanders, Torrey and Wing."], "Who writes jingles for advertisements?": [" That Prince Albert fellow--though, gosh, there can't be just one fellow that writes 'em; must be a big board of classy ink-slingers in conference, but anyway: now, him, he doesn't write for long-haired pikers, he writes for Regular Guys, he writes for ME, and I tip my benny to him! The only thing is: I wonder if it sells the goods? Course, like all these poets, this Prince Albert fellow lets his idea run away with him. It makes elegant reading, but it don't say nothing. I'd never go out and buy Prince Albert Tobacco after reading it, because it doesn't tell me anything about the stuff. It's just a bunch of fluff.\u201d Frink faced him: \u201cOh, you're crazy! Have I got to sell you the idea of Style? Anyway that's the kind of stuff I'd like to do for the Zeeco. But I simply can't. So I decided to stick to the straight poetic, and I took a shot at a highbrow ad for the Zeeco. How do you like this: The long white trail is calling--calling--and it's over the hills and far away for every man or woman that has red blood in his veins and on his lips the ancient song of the buccaneers.", " Now you've broken away, be wise!\u201d She did not telephone again, nor he, but after five more days she wrote to him: Have I offended you? You must know, dear, I didn't mean to. I'm so lonely and I need somebody to cheer me up. Why didn't you come to the nice party we had at Carrie's last evening I remember she invited you. Can't you come around here to-morrow Thur evening? I shall be alone and hope to see you. His reflections were numerous: \u201cDoggone it, why can't she let me alone? Why can't women ever learn a fellow hates to be bulldozed? And they always take advantage of you by yelling how lonely they are. \u201cNow that isn't nice of you, young fella. She's a fine, square, straight girl, and she does get lonely. She writes a swell hand. Nice-looking stationery. Plain. Refined. I guess I'll have to go see her. Well, thank God, I got till to-morrow night free of her, anyway. \u201cShe's nice but--Hang it, I won't be MADE to do things!", " We're going to have a toboggan party--want to take some coffee mit.

What was he doing?\u201d \u201cHow do you mean?\u201d He unbuttoned his overcoat, sat tentatively on the arm of a chair. \u201cYou know how I mean!\u201d She slapped the pages of a magazine with an irritable clatter. \u201cI suppose he was trying to make love to some hotel waitress or manicure girl or somebody.\u201d \u201cHang it, you're always letting on that Paul goes round chasing skirts. He doesn't, in the first place, and if he did, it would prob'ly be because you keep hinting at him and dinging at him so much.

He calls it a 'bobtail jacket for a ringtail monkey,' and you couldn't get him into one unless you chloroformed him!\u201d \u201cNow don't be horrid, George.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't want to be horrid, but Lord! you're getting as fussy as Verona. Ever since she got out of college she's been too rambunctious to live with--doesn't know what she wants--well, I know what she wants!--all she wants is to marry a millionaire, and live in Europe, and hold some preacher's hand, and simultaneously at the same time stay right here in Zenith and be some blooming kind of a socialist agitator or boss charity-worker or some damn thing!", " If he could but take up a backwoods claim with a man like Joe, work hard with his hands, be free and noisy in a flannel shirt, and never come back to this dull decency!

There'd be enough money at home for the family to live on till Verona was married and Ted self-supporting. Old Henry T. would look out for them. Honestly! Why NOT? Really LIVE-- He longed for it, admitted that he longed for it, then almost believed that he was going to do it. Whenever common sense snorted, \u201cNonsense! Folks don't run away from decent families and partners; just simply don't do it, that's all!\u201d then Babbitt answered pleadingly, \u201cWell, it wouldn't take any more nerve than for Paul to go to jail and--Lord, how I'd' like to do it! Moccasins--six-gun--frontier town--gamblers--sleep under the stars--be a regular man, with he-men like Joe Paradise--gosh!\u201d So he came to Maine, again stood on the wharf before the camp-hotel, again spat heroically into the delicate and shivering water, while the pines rustled, the mountains glowed, and a trout leaped and fell in a sliding circle.", " And then the way you been carrying on personally!

Below the bridge curved a railroad, a maze of green and crimson lights. The New York Flyer boomed past, and twenty lines of polished steel leaped into the glare. In one of the skyscrapers the wires of the Associated Press were closing down. The telegraph operators wearily raised their celluloid eye-shades after a night of talking with Paris and Peking. Through the building crawled the scrubwomen, yawning, their old shoes slapping. The dawn mist spun away. Cues of men with lunch-boxes clumped toward the immensity of new factories, sheets of glass and hollow tile, glittering shops where five thousand men worked beneath one roof, pouring out the honest wares that would be sold up the Euphrates and across the veldt. The whistles rolled out in greeting a chorus cheerful as the April dawn; the song of labor in a city built--it seemed--for giants.", " On a December morning when the Babbitts went to church, Dr. John Jennison Drew was unusually eloquent. The crowd was immense. Ten brisk young ushers, in morning coats with white roses, were bringing folding chairs up from the basement. There was an impressive musical program, conducted by Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A., who also sang the offertory. Babbitt cared less for this, because some misguided person had taught young Mr. Smeeth to smile, smile, smile while he was singing, but with all the appreciation of a fellow-orator he admired Dr. Drew's sermon. It had the intellectual quality which distinguished the Chatham Road congregation from the grubby chapels on Smith Street. \u201cAt this abundant harvest-time of all the year,\u201d Dr. Drew chanted, \u201cwhen, though stormy the sky and laborious the path to the drudging wayfarer, yet the hovering and bodiless spirit swoops back o'er all the labors and desires of the past twelve months, oh, then it seems to me there sounds behind all our apparent failures the golden chorus of greeting from those passed happily on; and lo!", " All through the meal Gunch watched them, while Babbitt watched himself being watched and lugubriously tried to keep from spoiling Tanis's gaiety. \u201cI felt like a spree to-day,\u201d she rippled. \u201cI love the Thornleigh, don't you? It's so live and yet so--so refined.\u201d He made talk about the Thornleigh, the service, the food, the people he recognized in the restaurant, all but Vergil Gunch. There did not seem to be anything else to talk of. He smiled conscientiously at her fluttering jests; he agreed with her that Minnie Sonntag was \u201cso hard to get along with,\u201d and young Pete \u201csuch a silly lazy kid, really just no good at all.\u201d But he himself had nothing to say. He considered telling her his worries about Gunch, but--\u201coh, gosh, it was too much work to go into the whole thing and explain about Verg and everything.\u201d He was relieved when he put Tanis on a trolley; he was cheerful in the familiar simplicities of his office."], "What has given Babbitt the headache he wakes up with?": [" So I lets it go at that. Well, the clerk wakes a nice young bell hop--fine lad--not a day over seventy-nine years old--fought at the Battle of Gettysburg and doesn't know it's over yet--thought I was one of the Confederates, I guess, from the way he looked at me--and Rip van Winkle took me up to something--I found out afterwards they called it a room, but first I thought there'd been some mistake--I thought they were putting me in the Salvation Army collection-box! At seven per each and every diem! Gosh!\u201d \u201cYuh, I've heard the Rippleton was pretty cheesy. Now, when I go to Chicago I always stay at the Blackstone or the La Salle--first-class places.\u201d \u201cSay, any of you fellows ever stay at the Birchdale at Terre Haute? How is it?\u201d \u201cOh, the Birchdale is a first-class hotel.\u201d (Twelve minutes of conference on the state of hotels in South Bend, Flint, Dayton, Tulsa, Wichita, Fort Worth, Winona, Erie, Fargo, and Moose Jaw.)", " As Babbitt sneaked from Floral Heights down to the Bunch, so the young gallants sneaked from the proprieties of the Bunch off to \u201ctimes\u201d with bouncing young women whom they picked up in department stores and at hotel coatrooms. Once Babbitt tried to accompany them. There was a motor car, a bottle of whisky, and for him a grubby shrieking cash-girl from Parcher and Stein's. He sat beside her and worried. He was apparently expected to \u201cjolly her along,\u201d but when she sang out, \u201cHey, leggo, quit crushing me cootie-garage,\u201d he did not quite know how to go on. They sat in the back room of a saloon, and Babbitt had a headache, was confused by their new slang, looked at them benevolently, wanted to go home, and had a drink--a good many drinks. Two evenings after, Fulton Bemis, the surly older man of the Bunch, took Babbitt aside and grunted, \u201cLook here, it's none of my business, and God knows I always lap up my share of the hootch, but don't you think you better watch yourself?", " \u201cI'd like awfully to run over to Rome for a few weeks.\u201d \u201cI suppose you see a lot of pictures and music and curios and everything there.\u201d \u201cNo, what I really go for is: there's a little trattoria on the Via della Scrofa where you get the best fettuccine in the world.\u201d \u201cOh, I--Yes. That must be nice to try that. Yes.\u201d At a quarter to ten McKelvey discovered with profound regret that his wife had a headache. He said blithely, as Babbitt helped him with his coat, \u201cWe must lunch together some time, and talk over the old days.\u201d When the others had labored out, at half-past ten, Babbitt turned to his wife, pleading, \u201cCharley said he had a corking time and we must lunch--said they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before long.\u201d She achieved, \u201cOh, it's just been one of those quiet evenings that are often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at once and doesn't really settle down to-nice quiet enjoyment.\u201d But from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly, without hope.", " For the first time in weeks he was sufficiently roused by his wife to look at her. IV Myra Babbitt--Mrs. George F. Babbitt--was definitely mature. She had creases from the corners of her mouth to the bottom of her chin, and her plump neck bagged. But the thing that marked her as having passed the line was that she no longer had reticences before her husband, and no longer worried about not having reticences. She was in a petticoat now, and corsets which bulged, and unaware of being seen in bulgy corsets. She had become so dully habituated to married life that in her full matronliness she was as sexless as an anemic nun. She was a good woman, a kind woman, a diligent woman, but no one, save perhaps Tinka her ten-year-old, was at all interested in her or entirely aware that she was alive. After a rather thorough discussion of all the domestic and social aspects of towels she apologized to Babbitt for his having an alcoholic headache; and he recovered enough to endure the search for a B.V.D."], "What job is Verona doing?": [" The admiration of Kenneth Escott made him aware of Verona. She had become secretary to Mr. Gruensberg of the Gruensberg Leather Company; she did her work with the thoroughness of a mind which reveres details and never quite understands them; but she was one of the people who give an agitating impression of being on the point of doing something desperate--of leaving a job or a husband--without ever doing it. Babbitt was so hopeful about Escott's hesitant ardors that he became the playful parent. When he returned from the Elks he peered coyly into the living-room and gurgled, \u201cHas our Kenny been here to-night?\u201d He never credited Verona's protest, \u201cWhy, Ken and I are just good friends, and we only talk about Ideas. I won't have all this sentimental nonsense, that would spoil everything.\u201d It was Ted who most worried Babbitt. With conditions in Latin and English but with a triumphant record in manual training, basket-ball, and the organization of dances, Ted was struggling through his Senior year in the East Side High School.", " Thereafter he was often seen at the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church, but it is recorded that he avoided shaking hands with the pastor at the door. III If his moral fiber had been so weakened by rebellion that he was not quite dependable in the more rigorous campaigns of the Good Citizens' League nor quite appreciative of the church, yet there was no doubt of the joy with which Babbitt returned to the pleasures of his home and of the Athletic Club, the Boosters, the Elks. Verona and Kenneth Escott were eventually and hesitatingly married. For the wedding Babbitt was dressed as carefully as was Verona; he was crammed into the morning-coat he wore to teas thrice a year; and with a certain relief, after Verona and Kenneth had driven away in a limousine, he returned to the house, removed the morning coat, sat with his aching feet up on the davenport, and reflected that his wife and he could have the living-room to themselves now, and not have to listen to Verona and Kenneth worrying, in a cultured collegiate manner, about minimum wages and the Drama League.", " Can't get your fist onto 'em. Half cold, anyway!\u201d Ted Babbitt, junior in the great East Side High School, had been making hiccup-like sounds of interruption. He blurted now, \u201cSay, Rone, you going to--\u201d Verona whirled. \u201cTed! Will you kindly not interrupt us when we're talking about serious matters!\u201d \u201cAw punk,\u201d said Ted judicially. \u201cEver since somebody slipped up and let you out of college, Ammonia, you been pulling these nut conversations about what-nots and so-on-and-so-forths. Are you going to--I want to use the car tonight.\u201d Babbitt snorted, \u201cOh, you do! May want it myself!\u201d Verona protested, \u201cOh, you do, Mr. Smarty! I'm going to take it myself!\u201d Tinka wailed, \u201cOh, papa, you said maybe you'd drive us down to Rosedale!\u201d and Mrs. Babbitt, \u201cCareful, Tinka, your sleeve is in the butter.\u201d They glared, and Verona hurled, \u201cTed, you're a perfect pig about the car!\u201d \u201cCourse you're not! Not a-tall!\u201d Ted could be maddeningly bland.", " Nor was it at all evident to his acquaintances that there was a new George F. Babbitt, save that he was more irritable under the incessant chaffing at the Athletic Club, and once, when Vergil Gunch observed that Seneca Doane ought to be hanged, Babbitt snorted, \u201cOh, rats, he's not so bad.\u201d At home he grunted \u201cEh?\u201d across the newspaper to his commentatory wife, and was delighted by Tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, \u201cNo class to that corrugated iron garage. Have to build me a nice frame one.\u201d Verona and Kenneth Escott appeared really to be engaged. In his newspaper Escott had conducted a pure-food crusade against commission-houses. As a result he had been given an excellent job in a commission-house, and he was making a salary on which he could marry, and denouncing irresponsible reporters who wrote stories criticizing commission-houses without knowing what they were talking about."], "What calms Babbitt at the breakfast table?": [" Have some?\u201d They looked at each other in a grin of understanding. Paul took the plug, gnawed at it. They stood quiet, their jaws working. They solemnly spat, one after the other, into the placid water. They stretched voluptuously, with lifted arms and arched backs. From beyond the mountains came the shuffling sound of a far-off train. A trout leaped, and fell back in a silver circle. They sighed together. IV They had a week before their families came. Each evening they planned to get up early and fish before breakfast. Each morning they lay abed till the breakfast-bell, pleasantly conscious that there were no efficient wives to rouse them. The mornings were cold; the fire was kindly as they dressed. Paul was distressingly clean, but Babbitt reveled in a good sound dirtiness, in not having to shave till his spirit was moved to it. He treasured every grease spot and fish-scale on his new khaki trousers.", " The room was very still. It was a room which observed the best Floral Heights standards. The gray walls were divided into artificial paneling by strips of white-enameled pine. From the Babbitts' former house had come two much-carved rocking-chairs, but the other chairs were new, very deep and restful, upholstered in blue and gold-striped velvet. A blue velvet davenport faced the fireplace, and behind it was a cherrywood table and a tall piano-lamp with a shade of golden silk. (Two out of every three houses in Floral Heights had before the fireplace a davenport, a mahogany table real or imitation, and a piano-lamp or a reading-lamp with a shade of yellow or rose silk.) On the table was a runner of gold-threaded Chinese fabric, four magazines, a silver box containing cigarette-crumbs, and three \u201cgift-books\u201d--large, expensive editions of fairy-tales illustrated by English artists and as yet unread by any Babbitt save Tinka.", " Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried, \u201cSee you later, boys,\u201d and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then, neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference, nor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic Club. He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him, admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women. Paul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had been parted three years, not three days--and they said: \u201cHow's the old horse-thief?\u201d \u201cAll right, I guess. How're you, you poor shrimp?\u201d \u201cI'm first-rate, you second-hand hunk o' cheese.\u201d Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, \u201cYou're a fine guy, you are! Ten minutes late!\u201d Riesling snapped, \u201cWell, you're lucky to have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!\u201d They grinned and went into the Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before their own images in the massy mirror.", " and with that he drove on and left the fellow standing there in the road like a bump on a log!\u201d Babbitt was most exasperated when she revealed his boyhood to the children. He had, it seemed, been fond of barley-sugar; had worn the \u201cloveliest little pink bow in his curls\u201d and corrupted his own name to \u201cGoo-goo.\u201d He heard (though he did not officially hear) Ted admonishing Tinka, \u201cCome on now, kid; stick the lovely pink bow in your curls and beat it down to breakfast, or Goo-goo will jaw your head off.\u201d Babbitt's half-brother, Martin, with his wife and youngest baby, came down from Catawba for two days. Martin bred cattle and ran the dusty general-store. He was proud of being a freeborn independent American of the good old Yankee stock; he was proud of being honest, blunt, ugly, and disagreeable. His favorite remark was \u201cHow much did you pay for that?\u201d He regarded Verona's books, Babbitt's silver pencil, and flowers on the table as citified extravagances, and said so."], "Who does Babbitt respect as a \u201cgreat scholar\u201d?": [" \u201cHow much we takin' to-day?\u201d asked Moon, in a manner which combined the independence of the great specialist, the friendliness of a familiar gossip, and respect for a man of weight in the community, like George F.

He was a Bachelor of Arts of Blodgett College, and a Doctor of Philosophy in economics of Yale. He was the employment-manager and publicity-counsel of the Zenith Street Traction Company. He could, on ten hours' notice, appear before the board of aldermen or the state legislature and prove, absolutely, with figures all in rows and with precedents from Poland and New Zealand, that the street-car company loved the Public and yearned over its employees; that all its stock was owned by Widows and Orphans; and that whatever it desired to do would benefit property-owners by increasing rental values, and help the poor by lowering rents. All his acquaintances turned to Littlefield when they desired to know the date of the battle of Saragossa, the definition of the word \u201csabotage,\u201d the future of the German mark, the translation of \u201chinc illae lachrimae,\u201d or the number of products of coal tar.", " \u201c--but finally I explains to him: 'If you'd done as much as I have on Chamber of Commerce committees and all,' I says, 'then you'd have the right to talk!

He bribed the mayor's doorman with a dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, \u201cYou remember me, Mr. Prout?", " Even in his grief the Babbitt who admired all technical excellences was interested in the kindly skill with which the attendants slid Mrs. Babbitt upon a stretcher and carried her down-stairs. The ambulance was a huge, suave, varnished, white thing. Mrs. Babbitt moaned, \u201cIt frightens me. It's just like a hearse, just like being put in a hearse.

There's a fine little camp-stool in there,\u201d the older attendant said, with professional pride. He sat beside her in that traveling cabin with its cot, its stool, its active little electric radiator, and its quite unexplained calendar, displaying a girl eating cherries, and the name of an enterprising grocer. But as he flung out his hand in hopeless cheerfulness it touched the radiator, and he squealed: \u201cOuch!", " Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time whisky, but then, it was only twice-- Dr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in. He had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and Eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped. He called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield explained to Babbitt that Eunice's mother had a headache and needed her. She went off in tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. \u201cThat little devil! Getting Ted into trouble! And Littlefield, the conceited old gas-bag, acting like it was Ted that was the bad influence!\u201d Later he smelled whisky on Ted's breath. After the civil farewell to the guests, the row was terrific, a thorough Family Scene, like an avalanche, devastating and without reticences. Babbitt thundered, Mrs. Babbitt wept, Ted was unconvincingly defiant, and Verona in confusion as to whose side she was taking.", " Listen!\u201d \u201c--It puts him in solid with big men like Doc Dilling and--\u201d \u201cGeorge! Paul Riesling--\u201d \u201cYes, sure, I'll 'phone Paul and let him know about it right away.\u201d \u201cGeorgie! LISTEN! Paul's in jail. He shot his wife, he shot Zilla, this noon. She may not live.\u201d CHAPTER XXII I HE drove to the City Prison, not blindly, but with unusual fussy care at corners, the fussiness of an old woman potting plants. It kept him from facing the obscenity of fate. The attendant said, \u201cNaw, you can't see any of the prisoners till three-thirty--visiting-hour.\u201d It was three. For half an hour Babbitt sat looking at a calendar and a clock on a whitewashed wall. The chair was hard and mean and creaky. People went through the office and, he thought, stared at him. He felt a belligerent defiance which broke into a wincing fear of this machine which was grinding Paul--Paul---- Exactly at half-past three he sent in his name."], "What does Babbitt give a person waiting for the streetcars?": [" There was a big crowd waiting in the lobby, us at the tail-end. She began to push right through it with her 'Sir, how dare you?' manner--Honestly, sometimes when I look at her and see how she's always so made up and stinking of perfume and looking for trouble and kind of always yelping, 'I tell yuh I'm a lady, damn yuh!' --why, I want to kill her! Well, she keeps elbowing through the crowd, me after her, feeling good and ashamed, till she's almost up to the velvet rope and ready to be the next let in. But there was a little squirt of a man there--probably been waiting half an hour--I kind of admired the little cuss--and he turns on Zilla and says, perfectly polite, 'Madam, why are you trying to push past me?' And she simply--God, I was so ashamed!--she rips out at him, 'You're no gentleman,' and she drags me into it and hollers, 'Paul, this person insulted me!' and the poor skate he got ready to fight.", " Fine! Wouldn't be much work for garages if everybody looked after their car the way you do.\u201d \u201cWell, I do try and have some sense about it.\u201d Babbitt paid his bill, said adequately, \u201cOh, keep the change,\u201d and drove off in an ecstasy of honest self-appreciation. It was with the manner of a Good Samaritan that he shouted at a respectable-looking man who was waiting for a trolley car, \u201cHave a lift?\u201d As the man climbed in Babbitt condescended, \u201cGoing clear down-town? Whenever I see a fellow waiting for a trolley, I always make it a practice to give him a lift--unless, of course, he looks like a bum.\u201d \u201cWish there were more folks that were so generous with their machines,\u201d dutifully said the victim of benevolence. \u201cOh, no, 'tain't a question of generosity, hardly. Fact, I always feel--I was saying to my son just the other night--it's a fellow's duty to share the good things of this world with his neighbors, and it gets my goat when a fellow gets stuck on himself and goes around tooting his horn merely because he's charitable.\u201d The victim seemed unable to find the right answer.", " He leaped up. He seemed very large. He seized Zilla's shoulder. The cautions of the broker were wiped from his face, and his voice was cruel: \u201cI've had enough of all this damn nonsense! I've known you for twenty-five years, Zil, and I never knew you to miss a chance to take your disappointments out on Paul. You're not wicked. You're worse. You're a fool. And let me tell you that Paul is the finest boy God ever made. Every decent person is sick and tired of your taking advantage of being a woman and springing every mean innuendo you can think of. Who the hell are you that a person like Paul should have to ask your PERMISSION to go with me? You act like you were a combination of Queen Victoria and Cleopatra. You fool, can't you see how people snicker at you, and sneer at you?\u201d Zilla was sobbing, \u201cI've never--I've never--nobody ever talked to me like this in all my life!\u201d \u201cNo, but that's the way they talk behind your back!", " Babbitt was stirred to hysteric patriotism. He leaped on a bench, shouting to the crowd: \u201cWhat's the matter with Zenith?\u201d \u201cShe's all right!\u201d \u201cWhat's best ole town in the U. S. A.?\u201d \u201cZeeeeeen-ith!\u201d The patient poor people waiting for the midnight train stared in unenvious wonder--Italian women with shawls, old weary men with broken shoes, roving road-wise boys in suits which had been flashy when they were new but which were faded now and wrinkled. Babbitt perceived that as an official delegate he must be more dignified. With Wing and Rogers he tramped up and down the cement platform beside the waiting Pullmans. Motor-driven baggage-trucks and red-capped porters carrying bags sped down the platform with an agreeable effect of activity. Arc-lights glared and stammered overhead. The glossy yellow sleeping-cars shone impressively. Babbitt made his voice to be measured and lordly; he thrust out his abdomen and rumbled, \u201cWe got to see to it that the convention lets the Legislature understand just where they get off in this matter of taxing realty transfers.\u201d Wing uttered approving grunts and Babbitt swelled--gloated."], "Who does Babbitt defend to the man he helps?": [" But you can't understand that--I'm through. I can't go Zilla's hammering any longer. She's made up her mind that I'm a devil, and--Reg'lar Inquisition. Torture. She enjoys it. It's a game to see how sore she can make me. And me, either it's find a little comfort, any comfort, anywhere, or else do something a lot worse. Now this Mrs. Arnold, she's not so young, but she's a fine woman and she understands a fellow, and she's had her own troubles.\u201d \u201cYea! I suppose she's one of these hens whose husband 'doesn't understand her'!\u201d \u201cI don't know. Maybe. He was killed in the war.\u201d Babbitt lumbered up, stood beside Paul patting his shoulder, making soft apologetic noises. \u201cHonest, George, she's a fine woman, and she's had one hell of a time. We manage to jolly each other up a lot. We tell each other we're the dandiest pair on earth. Maybe we don't believe it, but it helps a lot to have somebody with whom you can be perfectly simple, and not all this discussing--explaining--\u201d \u201cAnd that's as far as you go?\u201d \u201cIt is not!", " He'd be glad to hear about it!\u201d Drum strode on, while all the table stared at Babbitt. \u201cWhat's the idea? Do you want us to give those hell-hounds love and kisses, or what?\u201d said Orville Jones. \u201cDo you defend a lot of hoodlums that are trying to take the bread and butter away from our families?\u201d raged Professor Pumphrey. Vergil Gunch intimidatingly said nothing. He put on sternness like a mask; his jaw was hard, his bristly short hair seemed cruel, his silence was a ferocious thunder. While the others assured Babbitt that they must have misunderstood him, Gunch looked as though he had understood only too well. Like a robed judge he listened to Babbitt's stammering: \u201cNo, sure; course they're a bunch of toughs. But I just mean--Strikes me it's bad policy to talk about clubbing 'em. Cabe Nixon doesn't. He's got the fine Italian hand. And that's why he's colonel. Clarence Drum is jealous of him.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Professor Pumphrey, \u201cyou hurt Clarence's feelings, George.", " Where Zilla mocked him as a country boy, Myra said indignantly that he was ever so much solider than the young dandies who had been born in the great city of Zenith--an ancient settlement in 1897, one hundred and five years old, with two hundred thousand population, the queen and wonder of all the state and, to the Catawba boy, George Babbitt, so vast and thunderous and luxurious that he was flattered to know a girl ennobled by birth in Zenith. Of love there was no talk between them. He knew that if he was to study law he could not marry for years; and Myra was distinctly a Nice Girl--one didn't kiss her, one didn't \u201cthink about her that way at all\u201d unless one was going to marry her. But she was a dependable companion. She was always ready to go skating, walking; always content to hear his discourses on the great things he was going to do, the distressed poor whom he would defend against the Unjust Rich, the speeches he would make at Banquets, the inexactitudes of popular thought which he would correct.", " Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried, \u201cSee you later, boys,\u201d and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then, neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference, nor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic Club. He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him, admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women. Paul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had been parted three years, not three days--and they said: \u201cHow's the old horse-thief?\u201d \u201cAll right, I guess. How're you, you poor shrimp?\u201d \u201cI'm first-rate, you second-hand hunk o' cheese.\u201d Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, \u201cYou're a fine guy, you are! Ten minutes late!\u201d Riesling snapped, \u201cWell, you're lucky to have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!\u201d They grinned and went into the Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before their own images in the massy mirror."], "What does Babbitt give to his secretary Miss McGoun?": [" Oughtn't to call him so hard. But rats, got to haul folks over the coals now and then for their own good. Unpleasant duty, but--I wonder if Stan is sore? What's he saying to McGoun out there?\u201d So chill a wind of hatred blew from the outer office that the normal comfort of his evening home-going was ruined. He was distressed by losing that approval of his employees to which an executive is always slave. Ordinarily he left the office with a thousand enjoyable fussy directions to the effect that there would undoubtedly be important tasks to-morrow, and Miss McGoun and Miss Bannigan would do well to be there early, and for heaven's sake remind him to call up Conrad Lyte soon 's he came in. To-night he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness. He was as afraid of his still-faced clerks--of the eyes focused on him, Miss McGoun staring with head lifted from her typing, Miss Bannigan looking over her ledger, Mat Penniman craning around at his desk in the dark alcove, Stanley Graff sullenly expressionless--as a parvenu before the bleak propriety of his butler.", " He was uncomfortable with her successor, Miss Havstad. What Miss Havstad's given name was, no one in the office ever knew. It seemed improbable that she had a given name, a lover, a powder-puff, or a digestion. She was so impersonal, this slight, pale, industrious Swede, that it was vulgar to think of her as going to an ordinary home to eat hash. She was a perfectly oiled and enameled machine, and she ought, each evening, to have been dusted off and shut in her desk beside her too-slim, too-frail pencil points. She took dictation swiftly, her typing was perfect, but Babbitt became jumpy when he tried to work with her. She made him feel puffy, and at his best-beloved daily jokes she looked gently inquiring. He longed for Miss McGoun's return, and thought of writing to her. Then he heard that Miss McGoun had, a week after leaving him, gone over to his dangerous competitors, Sanders, Torrey and Wing.", " It possessed a non-conducting fiber ice-container, a porcelain water-jar (guaranteed hygienic), a drip-less non-clogging sanitary faucet, and machine-painted decorations in two tones of gold. He looked down the relentless stretch of tiled floor at the water-cooler, and assured himself that no tenant of the Reeves Building had a more expensive one, but he could not recapture the feeling of social superiority it had given him. He astoundingly grunted, \u201cI'd like to beat it off to the woods right now. And loaf all day. And go to Gunch's again to-night, and play poker, and cuss as much as I feel like, and drink a hundred and nine-thousand bottles of beer.\u201d He sighed; he read through his mail; he shouted \u201cMsgoun,\u201d which meant \u201cMiss McGoun\u201d; and began to dictate. This was his own version of his first letter: \u201cOmar Gribble, send it to his office, Miss McGoun, yours of twentieth to hand and in reply would say look here, Gribble, I'm awfully afraid if we go on shilly-shallying like this we'll just naturally lose the Allen sale, I had Allen up on carpet day before yesterday and got right down to cases and think I can assure you--uh, uh, no, change that: all my experience indicates he is all right, means to do business, looked into his financial record which is fine--that sentence seems to be a little balled up, Miss McGoun; make a couple sentences out of it if you have to, period, new paragraph.", " There was laughter, this week, when it was announced that one of the contributors was Barnabas Joy, the undertaker. Everybody whispered, \u201cI can think of a coupla good guys to be buried if his donation is a free funeral!\u201d Through all these diversions the Boosters were lunching on chicken croquettes, peas, fried potatoes, coffee, apple pie, and American cheese. Gunch did not lump the speeches. Presently he called on the visiting secretary of the Zenith Rotary Club, a rival organization. The secretary had the distinction of possessing State Motor Car License Number 5. The Rotary secretary laughingly admitted that wherever he drove in the state so low a number created a sensation, and \u201cthough it was pretty nice to have the honor, yet traffic cops remembered it only too darn well, and sometimes he didn't know but what he'd almost as soon have just plain B56,876 or something like that. Only let any doggone Booster try to get Number 5 away from a live Rotarian next year, and watch the fur fly!"], "Who does Babbitt argue with over the poetic value of Laylock's advertisement for the Glen Oriole division?": [" Fifteen minutes after the purple prose of Babbitt's form-letter, Chester Kirby Laylock, the resident salesman at Glen Oriole, came in to report a sale and submit an advertisement. Babbitt disapproved of Laylock, who sang in choirs and was merry at home over games of Hearts and Old Maid. He had a tenor voice, wavy chestnut hair, and a mustache like a camel's-hair brush. Babbitt considered it excusable in a family-man to growl, \u201cSeen this new picture of the kid--husky little devil, eh?\u201d but Laylock's domestic confidences were as bubbling as a girl's. \u201cSay, I think I got a peach of an ad for the Glen, Mr. Babbitt. Why don't we try something in poetry? Honest, it'd have wonderful pulling-power. Listen: 'Mid pleasures and palaces, Wherever you may roam, You just provide the little bride And we'll provide the home. Do you get it? See--like 'Home Sweet Home.' Don't you--\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes, hell yes, of course I get it.", " Some one had told him, when he was twenty-two, that all cesspools were unhealthy, and he still denounced them. If a client impertinently wanted him to sell a house which had a cesspool, Babbitt always spoke about it--before accepting the house and selling it. When he laid out the Glen Oriole acreage development, when he ironed woodland and dipping meadow into a glenless, orioleless, sunburnt flat prickly with small boards displaying the names of imaginary streets, he righteously put in a complete sewage-system. It made him feel superior; it enabled him to sneer privily at the Martin Lumsen development, Avonlea, which had a cesspool; and it provided a chorus for the full-page advertisements in which he announced the beauty, convenience, cheapness, and supererogatory healthfulness of Glen Oriole. The only flaw was that the Glen Oriole sewers had insufficient outlet, so that waste remained in them, not very agreeably, while the Avonlea cesspool was a Waring septic tank.", " The whole of the Glen Oriole project was a suggestion that Babbitt, though he really did hate men recognized as swindlers, was not too unreasonably honest. Operators and buyers prefer that brokers should not be in competition with them as operators and buyers themselves, but attend to their clients' interests only. It was supposed that the Babbitt-Thompson Company were merely agents for Glen Oriole, serving the real owner, Jake Offutt, but the fact was that Babbitt and Thompson owned sixty-two per cent. of the Glen, the president and purchasing agent of the Zenith Street Traction Company owned twenty-eight per cent., and Jake Offutt (a gang-politician, a small manufacturer, a tobacco-chewing old farceur who enjoyed dirty politics, business diplomacy, and cheating at poker) had only ten per cent., which Babbitt and the Traction officials had given to him for \u201cfixing\u201d health inspectors and fire inspectors and a member of the State Transportation Commission.", " Well, how'd it strike you?... Huh? ...Oh,\u201d irresolutely, \u201coh, I see.\u201d As Babbitt marched into his private room, a coop with semi-partition of oak and frosted glass, at the back of the office, he reflected how hard it was to find employees who had his own faith that he was going to make sales. There were nine members of the staff, besides Babbitt and his partner and father-in-law, Henry Thompson, who rarely came to the office. The nine were Stanley Graff, the outside salesman--a youngish man given to cigarettes and the playing of pool; old Mat Penniman, general utility man, collector of rents and salesman of insurance--broken, silent, gray; a mystery, reputed to have been a \u201ccrack\u201d real-estate man with a firm of his own in haughty Brooklyn; Chester Kirby Laylock, resident salesman out at the Glen Oriole acreage development--an enthusiastic person with a silky mustache and much family; Miss Theresa McGoun, the swift and rather pretty stenographer; Miss Wilberta Bannigan, the thick, slow, laborious accountant and file-clerk; and four freelance part-time commission salesmen."], "What relation does Babbitt imagine Riesling is to him?": [" Besides, they never do. You always hear about these women that get followed and insulted and all, but I don't believe a word of it, or it's their own fault, the way some women look at a person. I certainly never 've been insulted by--\u201d \u201cAw shoot. Mother, just suppose you WERE sometime! Just SUPPOSE! Can't you suppose something? Can't you imagine things?\u201d \u201cCertainly I can imagine things! The idea!\u201d \u201cCertainly your mother can imagine things--and suppose things! Think you're the only member of this household that's got an imagination?\u201d Babbitt demanded. \u201cBut what's the use of a lot of supposing? Supposing never gets you anywhere. No sense supposing when there's a lot of real facts to take into considera--\u201d \u201cLook here, Dad. Suppose--I mean, just--just suppose you were in your office and some rival real-estate man--\u201d \u201cRealtor!\u201d \u201c--some realtor that you hated came in--\u201d \u201cI don't hate any realtor.\u201d \u201cBut suppose you DID!\u201d \u201cI don't intend to suppose anything of the kind!", " Paul Riesling was coming in.

They had been classmates, roommates, in the State University, but always he thought of Paul Riesling, with his dark slimness, his precisely parted hair, his nose-glasses, his hesitant speech, his moodiness, his love of music, as a younger brother, to be petted and protected."], "What does Babbitt lack real knowledge of?": [" He proposed to his family, \u201cLook here, folks! Do you know who's going to trot up to Chicago for a couple of days--just week-end; won't lose but one day of school--know who's going with that celebrated business-ambassador, George F. Babbitt?

Ted was young only in his assumption of oldness, and the only realms, apparently, in which Babbitt had a larger and more grown-up knowledge than Ted's were the details of real estate and the phrases of politics. When the other sages of the Pullman smoking-compartment had left them to themselves, Babbitt's voice did not drop into the playful and otherwise offensive tone in which one addresses children but continued its overwhelming and monotonous rumble, and Ted tried to imitate it in his strident tenor: \u201cGee, dad, you certainly did show up that poor boot when he got flip about the League of Nations!\u201d \u201cWell, the trouble with a lot of these fellows is, they simply don't know what they're talking about.", " The S. A. R. E. B., as its members called it, with the universal passion for mysterious and important-sounding initials, was the State Association of Real Estate Boards; the organization of brokers and operators. It was to hold its annual convention at Monarch, Zenith's chief rival among the cities of the state. Babbitt was an official delegate; another was Cecil Rountree, whom Babbitt admired for his picaresque speculative building, and hated for his social position, for being present at the smartest dances on Royal Ridge. Rountree was chairman of the convention program-committee. Babbitt had growled to him, \u201cMakes me tired the way these doctors and profs and preachers put on lugs about being 'professional men.' A good realtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of 'em.\u201d \u201cRight you are! I say: Why don't you put that into a paper, and give it at the S. A. R. E. B.?\u201d suggested Rountree.", " \u201cWell, if it would help you in making up the program--Tell you: the way I look at it is this: First place, we ought to insist that folks call us 'realtors' and not 'real-estate men.' Sounds more like a reg'lar profession. Second place--What is it distinguishes a profession from a mere trade, business, or occupation? What is it? Why, it's the public service and the skill, the trained skill, and the knowledge and, uh, all that, whereas a fellow that merely goes out for the jack, he never considers the-public service and trained skill and so on. Now as a professional--\u201d \u201cRather! That's perfectly bully! Perfectly corking! Now you write it in a paper,\u201d said Rountree, as he rapidly and firmly moved away. II However accustomed to the literary labors of advertisements and correspondence, Babbitt was dismayed on the evening when he sat down to prepare a paper which would take a whole ten minutes to read.", " \u201cThey're the best folks on earth, those small-town folks, but, oh, mama! what conversation! Why, say, they can't talk about anything but the weather and the ne-oo Ford, by heckalorum!\u201d \u201cThat's right. They all talk about just the same things,\u201d said Eddie Swanson. \u201cDon't they, though! They just say the same things over and over,\u201d said Vergil Gunch. \u201cYes, it's really remarkable. They seem to lack all power of looking at things impersonally. They simply go over and over the same talk about Fords and the weather and so on.\u201d said Howard Littlefield. \u201cStill, at that, you can't blame 'em. They haven't got any intellectual stimulus such as you get up here in the city,\u201d said Chum Frink. \u201cGosh, that's right,\u201d said Babbitt. \u201cI don't want you highbrows to get stuck on yourselves but I must say it keeps a fellow right up on his toes to sit in with a poet and with Howard, the guy that put the con in economics!"], "What does Archibald Purdy want to build?": [" The rents, declared Babbitt, were too low; and by waiting they could make Purdy come to their price. (This was Vision.) He had to bully Lyte into buying. His first act as agent for Lyte was to increase the rent of the battered store-building on the lot. The tenant said a number of rude things, but he paid. Now, Purdy seemed ready to buy, and his delay was going to cost him ten thousand extra dollars--the reward paid by the community to Mr. Conrad Lyte for the virtue of employing a broker who had Vision and who understood Talking Points, Strategic Values, Key Situations, Underappraisals, and the Psychology of Salesmanship. Lyte came to the conference exultantly. He was fond of Babbitt, this morning, and called him \u201cold hoss.\u201d Purdy, the grocer, a long-nosed man and solemn, seemed to care less for Babbitt and for Vision, but Babbitt met him at the street door of the office and guided him toward the private room with affectionate little cries of \u201cThis way, Brother Purdy!\u201d He took from the correspondence-file the entire box of cigars and forced them on his guests.", " profit which, according to all authorities, a pioneer deserves for his risks and foresight. He was a stubby man with a cap-like mass of short gray curls and clothes which, no matter how well cut, seemed shaggy. Below his eyes were semicircular hollows, as though silver dollars had been pressed against them and had left an imprint. Particularly and always Lyte consulted Babbitt, and trusted in his slow cautiousness. Six months ago Babbitt had learned that one Archibald Purdy, a grocer in the indecisive residential district known as Linton, was talking of opening a butcher shop beside his grocery. Looking up the ownership of adjoining parcels of land, Babbitt found that Purdy owned his present shop but did not own the one available lot adjoining. He advised Conrad Lyte to purchase this lot, for eleven thousand dollars, though an appraisal on a basis of rents did not indicate its value as above nine thousand.", " Tell you what we'll do: We'll come down to twenty-three thousand-five thousand down and the rest on mortgage--and if you want to wreck the old shack and rebuild, I guess I can get Lyte here to loosen up for a building-mortgage on good liberal terms. Heavens, man, we'd be glad to oblige you! We don't like these foreign grocery trusts any better 'n you do! But it isn't reasonable to expect us to sacrifice eleven thousand or more just for neighborliness, IS it! How about it, Lyte?

At the right moment Babbitt snatched from a drawer the agreement he had had Miss McGoun type out a week ago and thrust it into Purdy's hands. He genially shook his fountain pen to make certain that it was flowing, handed it to Purdy, and approvingly watched him sign.", " He pushed their chairs two inches forward and three inches back, which gave an hospitable note, then leaned back in his desk-chair and looked plump and jolly. But he spoke to the weakling grocer with firmness. \u201cWell, Brother Purdy, we been having some pretty tempting offers from butchers and a slew of other folks for that lot next to your store, but I persuaded Brother Lyte that we ought to give you a shot at the property first. I said to Lyte, 'It'd be a rotten shame,' I said, 'if somebody went and opened a combination grocery and meat market right next door and ruined Purdy's nice little business.' Especially--\u201d Babbitt leaned forward, and his voice was harsh, \u201c--it would be hard luck if one of these cash-and-carry chain-stores got in there and started cutting prices below cost till they got rid of competition and forced you to the wall!\u201d Purdy snatched his thin hands from his pockets, pulled up his trousers, thrust his hands back into his pockets, tilted in the heavy oak chair, and tried to look amused, as he struggled: \u201cYes, they're bad competition."], "How much profit does Lyte make on the sale of the lot, thanks to Babbitt?": [" The rents, declared Babbitt, were too low; and by waiting they could make Purdy come to their price. (This was Vision.) He had to bully Lyte into buying. His first act as agent for Lyte was to increase the rent of the battered store-building on the lot. The tenant said a number of rude things, but he paid. Now, Purdy seemed ready to buy, and his delay was going to cost him ten thousand extra dollars--the reward paid by the community to Mr. Conrad Lyte for the virtue of employing a broker who had Vision and who understood Talking Points, Strategic Values, Key Situations, Underappraisals, and the Psychology of Salesmanship. Lyte came to the conference exultantly. He was fond of Babbitt, this morning, and called him \u201cold hoss.\u201d Purdy, the grocer, a long-nosed man and solemn, seemed to care less for Babbitt and for Vision, but Babbitt met him at the street door of the office and guided him toward the private room with affectionate little cries of \u201cThis way, Brother Purdy!\u201d He took from the correspondence-file the entire box of cigars and forced them on his guests.", " profit which, according to all authorities, a pioneer deserves for his risks and foresight.

Below his eyes were semicircular hollows, as though silver dollars had been pressed against them and had left an imprint. Particularly and always Lyte consulted Babbitt, and trusted in his slow cautiousness. Six months ago Babbitt had learned that one Archibald Purdy, a grocer in the indecisive residential district known as Linton, was talking of opening a butcher shop beside his grocery. Looking up the ownership of adjoining parcels of land, Babbitt found that Purdy owned his present shop but did not own the one available lot adjoining. He advised Conrad Lyte to purchase this lot, for eleven thousand dollars, though an appraisal on a basis of rents did not indicate its value as above nine thousand.", " The work of the world was being done. Lyte had made something over nine thousand dollars, Babbitt had made a four-hundred-and-fifty dollar commission, Purdy had, by the sensitive mechanism of modern finance, been provided with a business-building, and soon the happy inhabitants of Linton would have meat lavished upon them at prices only a little higher than those down-town. It had been a manly battle, but after it Babbitt drooped. This was the only really amusing contest he had been planning. There was nothing ahead save details of leases, appraisals, mortgages. He muttered, \u201cMakes me sick to think of Lyte carrying off most of the profit when I did all the work, the old skinflint! And--What else have I got to do to-day?... Like to take a good long vacation. Motor trip. Something.\u201d He sprang up, rekindled by the thought of lunching with Paul Riesling.

Heavens, man, we'd be glad to oblige you! We don't like these foreign grocery trusts any better 'n you do! But it isn't reasonable to expect us to sacrifice eleven thousand or more just for neighborliness, IS it! How about it, Lyte? You willing to come down?\u201d By warmly taking Purdy's part, Babbitt persuaded the benevolent Mr. Lyte to reduce his price to twenty-one thousand dollars.

Chapters are to be found now in thirty countries. Nine hundred and twenty of the thousand chapters, however, are in the United States. None of these is more ardent than the Zenith Boosters' Club. The second March lunch of the Zenith Boosters was the most important of the year, as it was to be followed by the annual election of officers. There was agitation abroad. The lunch was held in the ballroom of the O'Hearn House. As each of the four hundred Boosters entered he took from a wall-board a huge celluloid button announcing his name, his nick name, and his business. There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow Booster by anything but his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially checked his hat the air was radiant with shouts of \u201cHello, Chet!\u201d and \u201cHow're you, Shorty!\u201d and \u201cTop o' the mornin', Mac!\u201d They sat at friendly tables for eight, choosing places by lot.", " \u201cOh, hello, George. Thought you'd gone back to Zenith.\u201d He did not introduce his companion. Babbitt peeped at her. She was a flabbily pretty, weakly flirtatious woman of forty-two or three, in an atrocious flowery hat. Her rouging was thorough but unskilful. \u201cWhere you staying, Paulibus?\u201d The woman turned, yawned, examined her nails. She seemed accustomed to not being introduced. Paul grumbled, \u201cCampbell Inn, on the South Side.\u201d \u201cAlone?\u201d It sounded insinuating. \u201cYes!

Mrs. Arnold, this is my old-acquaintance, George Babbitt.\u201d \u201cPleasmeech,\u201d growled Babbitt, while she gurgled, \u201cOh, I'm very pleased to meet any friend of Mr. Riesling's, I'm sure.\u201d Babbitt demanded, \u201cBe back there later this evening, Paul? I'll drop down and see you.\u201d \u201cNo, better--We better lunch together to-morrow.\u201d \u201cAll right, but I'll see you to-night, too, Paul.", " \u201cI'd like awfully to run over to Rome for a few weeks.\u201d \u201cI suppose you see a lot of pictures and music and curios and everything there.\u201d \u201cNo, what I really go for is: there's a little trattoria on the Via della Scrofa where you get the best fettuccine in the world.\u201d \u201cOh, I--Yes. That must be nice to try that. Yes.\u201d At a quarter to ten McKelvey discovered with profound regret that his wife had a headache. He said blithely, as Babbitt helped him with his coat, \u201cWe must lunch together some time, and talk over the old days.\u201d When the others had labored out, at half-past ten, Babbitt turned to his wife, pleading, \u201cCharley said he had a corking time and we must lunch--said they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before long.\u201d She achieved, \u201cOh, it's just been one of those quiet evenings that are often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at once and doesn't really settle down to-nice quiet enjoyment.\u201d But from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly, without hope."], "What does Babbitt purchase right before meeting Riesling?": [" All together in the long yell!\u201d Babbitt felt that life would never be sweeter than now, when he joined with Paul Riesling and the newly recovered hero, McKelvey, in: Baaaaaattle-ax Get an ax, Bal-ax, Get-nax, Who, who? The U.! Hooroo! III The Babbitts invited the McKelveys to dinner, in early December, and the McKelveys not only accepted but, after changing the date once or twice, actually came. The Babbitts somewhat thoroughly discussed the details of the dinner, from the purchase of a bottle of champagne to the number of salted almonds to be placed before each person. Especially did they mention the matter of the other guests. To the last Babbitt held out for giving Paul Riesling the benefit of being with the McKelveys. \u201cGood old Charley would like Paul and Verg Gunch better than some highfalutin' Willy boy,\u201d he insisted, but Mrs. Babbitt interrupted his observations with, \u201cYes--perhaps--I think I'll try to get some Lynnhaven oysters,\u201d and when she was quite ready she invited Dr. J.

The house was peaceful, that evening, and he enjoyed a game of pinochle with his wife. He indignantly told the Tempter that he was content to do things in the good old fashioned way. The day after, he went to see the purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company and they made plans for the secret purchase of lots along the Evanston Road. But as he drove to his office he struggled, \u201cI'm going to run things and figure out things to suit myself--when I retire.\u201d VI Ted had come down from the University for the week-end. Though he no longer spoke of mechanical engineering and though he was reticent about his opinion of his instructors, he seemed no more reconciled to college, and his chief interest was his wireless telephone set. On Saturday evening he took Eunice Littlefield to a dance at Devon Woods. Babbitt had a glimpse of her, bouncing in the seat of the car, brilliant in a scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk."], "What words do members of the Athletic Club use to describe the Union Club?": [" And--Certainly looks nice there. Certainly is a mighty clever little jigger. Gives the last touch of refinement and class. I--By golly, I guess I can afford it if I want to! Not going to be the only member of this family that never has a single doggone luxury!\u201d Thus, laden with treasure, after three and a half blocks of romantic adventure, he drove up to the club. III The Zenith Athletic Club is not athletic and it isn't exactly a club, but it is Zenith in perfection. It has an active and smoke-misted billiard room, it is represented by baseball and football teams, and in the pool and the gymnasium a tenth of the members sporadically try to reduce. But most of its three thousand members use it as a cafe in which to lunch, play cards, tell stories, meet customers, and entertain out-of town uncles at dinner. It is the largest club in the city, and its chief hatred is the conservative Union Club, which all sound members of the Athletic call \u201ca rotten, snobbish, dull, expensive old hole--not one Good Mixer in the place--you couldn't hire me to join.\u201d Statistics show that no member of the Athletic has ever refused election to the Union, and of those who are elected, sixty-seven per cent.", " Among them Babbitt hustled back to his office, to sit down with nothing much to do except see that the staff looked as though they were hustling. III Every Saturday afternoon he hustled out to his country club and hustled through nine holes of golf as a rest after the week's hustle. In Zenith it was as necessary for a Successful Man to belong to a country club as it was to wear a linen collar. Babbitt's was the Outing Golf and Country Club, a pleasant gray-shingled building with a broad porch, on a daisy-starred cliff above Lake Kennepoose. There was another, the Tonawanda Country Club, to which belonged Charles McKelvey, Horace Updike, and the other rich men who lunched not at the Athletic but at the Union Club. Babbitt explained with frequency, \u201cYou couldn't hire me to join the Tonawanda, even if I did have a hundred and eighty bucks to throw away on the initiation fee. At the Outing we've got a bunch of real human fellows, and the finest lot of little women in town--just as good at joshing as the men--but at the Tonawanda there's nothing but these would-be's in New York get-ups, drinking tea!", " They give away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman.\u201d Remembering Ida Putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him, Babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had used him, he told of Paul Riesling, of Zilla, of Seneca Doane, of the strike: \u201cSee how it was? Course I was as anxious to have those beggars licked to a standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their side. For a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal, don't you think so?\u201d \u201cOh, I do!\u201d Sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her hands beside her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of being appreciated he proclaimed: \u201cSo I up and said to the fellows at the club, 'Look here,' I--\u201d \u201cDo you belong to the Union Club? I think it's--\u201d \u201cNo; the Athletic. Tell you: Course they're always asking me to join the Union, but I always say, 'No, sir!", " resign from the Athletic and are thereafter heard to say, in the drowsy sanctity of the Union lounge, \u201cThe Athletic would be a pretty good hotel, if it were more exclusive.\u201d The Athletic Club building is nine stories high, yellow brick with glassy roof-garden above and portico of huge limestone columns below. The lobby, with its thick pillars of porous Caen stone, its pointed vaulting, and a brown glazed-tile floor like well-baked bread-crust, is a combination of cathedral-crypt and rathskellar. The members rush into the lobby as though they were shopping and hadn't much time for it. Thus did Babbitt enter, and to the group standing by the cigar-counter he whooped, \u201cHow's the boys? How's the boys? Well, well, fine day!\u201d Jovially they whooped back--Vergil Gunch, the coal-dealer, Sidney Finkelstein, the ladies'-ready-to-wear buyer for Parcher & Stein's department-store, and Professor Joseph K. Pumphrey, owner of the Riteway Business College and instructor in Public Speaking, Business English, Scenario Writing, and Commercial Law."], "By what name are Babbitt and his friends collectively known?": [" It ain't so much-a-much of a name.

Wait, I'll skip up and ask Myra if she knows their name.\u201d Babbitt turned on the light in Ted's room. It was a brown boyish room; disordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of basket-ball teams and baseball teams. Ted was decidedly not there.

Now, I want to confess that, though I'm a literary guy by profession, I don't care a rap for all this long-haired music.

Fog hid the house now. The world was uncreated, a chaos without turmoil or desire. Through the mist came a man at so feverish a pace that he seemed to dance with fury as he entered the orb of glow from a street-lamp. At each step he brandished his stick and brought it down with a crash. His glasses on their broad pretentious ribbon banged against his stomach. Babbitt incredulously saw that it was Chum Frink.

There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow Booster by anything but his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially checked his hat the air was radiant with shouts of \u201cHello, Chet!\u201d and \u201cHow're you, Shorty!\u201d and \u201cTop o' the mornin', Mac!\u201d They sat at friendly tables for eight, choosing places by lot.", " I tell you, I'm a college man--I KNOW!

They're too crowded already, and what'll we do for workmen if all those fellows go and get educated?\u201d Ted was leaning back, smoking a cigarette without reproof. He was, for the moment, sharing the high thin air of Babbitt's speculation as though he were Paul Riesling or even Dr. Howard Littlefield. He hinted: \u201cWell, what do you think then, Dad?

In Zenith it is impossible to lunch with a neighbor's wife without the fact being known, before nightfall, in every house in your circle. But Tanis was beautifully discreet. However appealingly she might turn to him when they were alone, she was gravely detached when they were abroad, and he hoped that she would be taken for a client. Orville Jones once saw them emerging from a movie theater, and Babbitt bumbled, \u201cLet me make you 'quainted with Mrs. Judique. Now here's a lady who knows the right broker to come to, Orvy!\u201d Mr. Jones, though he was a man censorious of morals and of laundry machinery, seemed satisfied. His predominant fear--not from any especial fondness for her but from the habit of propriety--was that his wife would learn of the affair. He was certain that she knew nothing specific about Tanis, but he was also certain that she suspected something indefinite.", " In self-defense I got to toot my own horn, like a lawyer defending a client--his bounden duty, ain't it, to bring out the poor dub's good points? Why, the Judge himself would bawl out a lawyer that didn't, even if they both knew the guy was guilty! But even so, I don't pad out the truth like Cecil Rountree or Thayer or the rest of these realtors. Fact, I think a fellow that's willing to deliberately up and profit by lying ought to be shot!\u201d Babbitt's value to his clients was rarely better shown than this morning, in the conference at eleven-thirty between himself, Conrad Lyte, and Archibald Purdy. V Conrad Lyte was a real-estate speculator. He was a nervous speculator. Before he gambled he consulted bankers, lawyers, architects, contracting builders, and all of their clerks and stenographers who were willing to be cornered and give him advice. He was a bold entrepreneur, and he desired nothing more than complete safety in his investments, freedom from attention to details, and the thirty or forty per cent.", " Some one had told him, when he was twenty-two, that all cesspools were unhealthy, and he still denounced them. If a client impertinently wanted him to sell a house which had a cesspool, Babbitt always spoke about it--before accepting the house and selling it. When he laid out the Glen Oriole acreage development, when he ironed woodland and dipping meadow into a glenless, orioleless, sunburnt flat prickly with small boards displaying the names of imaginary streets, he righteously put in a complete sewage-system. It made him feel superior; it enabled him to sneer privily at the Martin Lumsen development, Avonlea, which had a cesspool; and it provided a chorus for the full-page advertisements in which he announced the beauty, convenience, cheapness, and supererogatory healthfulness of Glen Oriole. The only flaw was that the Glen Oriole sewers had insufficient outlet, so that waste remained in them, not very agreeably, while the Avonlea cesspool was a Waring septic tank."], "What does Babbitt help his father-in-law Thompson to buy?": [" Meeting people the way you do in the store, you could help us a lot.' \u201cWell, Your Father just looked at him and said, 'I certainly shall do nothing of the sort.

Well, you know how Your Father was, and this Smith knew it too; he knew what a Real Man he was, and he knew Your Father knew the political situation from A to Z, and he ought to have seen that here was one man he couldn't impose on, but he went on trying to and hinting and trying till Your Father spoke up and said to him, 'Captain Smith,' he said, 'I have a reputation around these parts for being one who is amply qualified to mind his own business and let other folks mind theirs!'", " But Henry Thompson growled, \u201cOh, t' hell with 'em!

Only if folks get an idea you're scatter-brained and unstable, you don't suppose they'll want to do business with you, do you? One little rumor about your being a crank would do more to ruin this business than all the plots and stuff that these fool story-writers could think up in a month of Sundays.\u201d That afternoon, when the old reliable Conrad Lyte, the merry miser, Conrad Lyte, appeared, and Babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land in the new residential section of Dorchester, Lyte said hastily, too hastily, \u201cNo, no, don't want to go into anything new just now.\u201d A week later Babbitt learned, through Henry Thompson, that the officials of the Street Traction Company were planning another real-estate coup, and that Sanders, Torrey and Wing, not the Babbitt-Thompson Company, were to handle it for them."], "Who strikes Babbitt as an example of taking civilization too far?": [" \u201cFor that reason I wish to keep him in prison, as an example to evil-doers. I've gotten religion, George, since the terrible thing that man did to me. Sometimes I used to be unkind, and I wished for worldly pleasures, for dancing and the theater. But when I was in the hospital the pastor of the Pentecostal Communion Faith used to come to see me, and he showed me, right from the prophecies written in the Word of God, that the Day of Judgment is coming and all the members of the older churches are going straight to eternal damnation, because they only do lip-service and swallow the world, the flesh, and the devil--\u201d For fifteen wild minutes she talked, pouring out admonitions to flee the wrath to come, and her face flushed, her dead voice recaptured something of the shrill energy of the old Zilla.

And Babbitt chose this time to be publicly liberal. He belonged to the sound, sane, right-thinking wing, and at first he agreed that the Crooked Agitators ought to be shot. He was sorry when his friend, Seneca Doane, defended arrested strikers, and he thought of going to Doane and explaining about these agitators, but when he read a broadside alleging that even on their former wages the telephone girls had been hungry, he was troubled. \u201cAll lies and fake figures,\u201d he said, but in a doubtful croak. For the Sunday after, the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church announced a sermon by Dr. John Jennison Drew on \u201cHow the Saviour Would End Strikes.\u201d Babbitt had been negligent about church-going lately, but he went to the service, hopeful that Dr. Drew really did have the information as to what the divine powers thought about strikes."], "After Ted and Babbitt discus Ted\u2019s education, Ted drives his friends to ___.": [" Can't get your fist onto 'em.

It was a brown boyish room; disordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of basket-ball teams and baseball teams. Ted was decidedly not there.

He had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and Eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped. He called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield explained to Babbitt that Eunice's mother had a headache and needed her. She went off in tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. \u201cThat little devil! Getting Ted into trouble!

She was then, Ted planned, to park the car in front of the candy-store across from the Armory and he would pick it up. There were masterly arrangements regarding leaving the key, and having the gasoline tank filled; and passionately, devotees of the Great God Motor, they hymned the patch on the spare inner-tube, and the lost jack-handle. Their truce dissolving, Ted observed that her friends were \u201ca scream of a bunch-stuck-up gabby four-flushers.\u201d His friends, she indicated, were \u201cdisgusting imitation sports, and horrid little shrieking ignorant girls.\u201d Further: \u201cIt's disgusting of you to smoke cigarettes, and so on and so forth, and those clothes you've got on this morning, they're too utterly ridiculous--honestly, simply disgusting.\u201d Ted balanced over to the low beveled mirror in the buffet, regarded his charms, and smirked."], "For whom do Babbitt and Myra throw a dinner party?": [" They and their set worked capably all the week, and all week looked forward to Saturday night, when they would, as they expressed it, \u201cthrow a party;\u201d and the thrown party grew noisier and noisier up to Sunday dawn, and usually included an extremely rapid motor expedition to nowhere in particular. One evening when Tanis was at the theater, Babbitt found himself being lively with the Doppelbraus, pledging friendship with men whom he had for years privily denounced to Mrs. Babbitt as a \u201crotten bunch of tin-horns that I wouldn't go out with, not if they were the last people on earth.\u201d That evening he had sulkily come home and poked about in front of the house, chipping off the walk the ice-clots, like fossil footprints, made by the steps of passers-by during the recent snow.

The alumnae of '08 turned out 60% strong. Are we boys going to be beaten by a bunch of skirts? Come on, fellows, let's work up some real genuine enthusiasm and all boost together for the snappiest dinner yet! Elegant eats, short ginger-talks, and memories shared together of the brightest, gladdest days of life. The dinner was held in a private room at the Union Club. The club was a dingy building, three pretentious old dwellings knocked together, and the entrance-hall resembled a potato cellar, yet the Babbitt who was free of the magnificence of the Athletic Club entered with embarrassment.", " \u201cMight as well go and get it over,\u201d Babbitt groaned to his wife. \u201cBut don't it simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn't know the first thing about social etiquette?

A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester. It was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at six-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven.

Babbitt melodramatically crept into an apartment containing four round tables, eleven chairs, a brewery calendar, and a smell. He waited.

He did not bend from his episcopal dignity, but he growled, \u201cI'll see if he's around.\u201d From the back room he brought an immensely old young man, a quiet sharp-eyed man, in tan silk shirt, checked vest hanging open, and burning brown trousers--Mr. Healey Hanson. Mr. Hanson said only \u201cYuh?\u201d but his implacable and contemptuous eyes queried Babbitt's soul, and he seemed not at all impressed by the new dark-gray suit for which (as he had admitted to every acquaintance at the Athletic Club) Babbitt had paid a hundred and twenty-five dollars. \u201cGlad meet you, Mr. Hanson.

He towed her about the room, bumping into other couples, into the radiator, into chair-legs cunningly ambushed. As he danced he surveyed the rest of the Bunch: A thin young woman who looked capable, conceited, and sarcastic. Another woman whom he could never quite remember. Three overdressed and slightly effeminate young men--soda-fountain clerks, or at least born for that profession. A man of his own age, immovable, self-satisfied, resentful of Babbitt's presence. When he had finished his dutiful dance Tanis took him aside and begged, \u201cDear, wouldn't you like to do something for me? I'm all out of booze, and the Bunch want to celebrate. Couldn't you just skip down to Healey Hanson's and get some?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d he said, trying not to sound sullen.", " \u201cI'll tell you: I'll get Minnie Sonntag to drive down with you.\u201d Tanis was pointing to the thin, sarcastic young woman. Miss Sonntag greeted him with an astringent \u201cHow d'you do, Mr. Babbitt. Tanis tells me you're a very prominent man, and I'm honored by being allowed to drive with you. Of course I'm not accustomed to associating with society people like you, so I don't know how to act in such exalted circles!\u201d Thus Miss Sonntag talked all the way down to Healey Hanson's. To her jibes he wanted to reply \u201cOh, go to the devil!\u201d but he never quite nerved himself to that reasonable comment. He was resenting the existence of the whole Bunch. He had heard Tanis speak of \u201cdarling Carrie\u201d and \u201cMin Sonntag--she's so clever--you'll adore her,\u201d but they had never been real to him.

Ed Overbrook and his wife were as awkward and threadbare as usual, and the other guests were two dreadful families whose names Babbitt never caught and never desired to catch. But he was touched, and disconcerted, by the tactless way in which Overbrook praised him: \u201cWe're mighty proud to have old George here to-night! Of course you've all read about his speeches and oratory in the papers--and the boy's good-looking, too, eh?--but what I always think of is back in college, and what a great old mixer he was, and one of the best swimmers in the class.\u201d Babbitt tried to be jovial; he worked at it; but he could find nothing to interest him in Overbrook's timorousness, the blankness of the other guests, or the drained stupidity of Mrs. Overbrook, with her spectacles, drab skin, and tight-drawn hair.", " DAD PETERSEN.

Members who had brought guests introduced them publicly. \u201cThis tall red-headed piece of misinformation is the sporting editor of the Press,\u201d said Willis Ijams; and H. H. Hazen, the druggist, chanted, \u201cBoys, when you're on a long motor tour and finally get to a romantic spot or scene and draw up and remark to the wife, 'This is certainly a romantic place,' it sends a glow right up and down your vertebrae. Well, my guest to-day is from such a place, Harper's Ferry, Virginia, in the beautiful Southland, with memories of good old General Robert E. Lee and of that brave soul, John Brown who, like every good Booster, goes marching on--\u201d There were two especially distinguished guests: the leading man of the \u201cBird of Paradise\u201d company, playing this week at the Dodsworth Theater, and the mayor of Zenith, the Hon.", " She squeezed his once, then relaxed. \u201cLouetta! I think you're the nicest thing I know!\u201d \u201cWell, I think you're very nice.\u201d \u201cDo you? You got to like me! I'm so lonely!\u201d \u201cOh, you'll be all right when your wife comes home.\u201d \u201cNo, I'm always lonely.\u201d She clasped her hands under her chin, so that he dared not touch her. He sighed: \u201cWhen I feel punk and--\u201d He was about to bring in the tragedy of Paul, but that was too sacred even for the diplomacy of love. \u201c--when I get tired out at the office and everything, I like to look across the street and think of you. Do you know I dreamed of you, one time!\u201d \u201cWas it a nice dream?\u201d \u201cLovely!\u201d \u201cOh, well, they say dreams go by opposites! Now I must run in.\u201d She was on her feet. \u201cOh, don't go in yet! Please, Louetta!\u201d \u201cYes, I must. Have to look out for my guests.\u201d \u201cLet 'em look out for 'emselves!\u201d \u201cI couldn't do that.\u201d She carelessly tapped his shoulder and slipped away.", " Ever start him spieling about gardening? Say, that fellow can tell you the name of every kind of tree, and some of their Greek and Latin names too! Besides, we owe the Joneses a dinner. Besides, gosh, we got to have some boob for audience, when a bunch of hot-air artists like Frink and Littlefield get going.\u201d \u201cWell, dear--I meant to speak of this--I do think that as host you ought to sit back and listen, and let your guests have a chance to talk once in a while!\u201d \u201cOh, you do, do you! Sure! I talk all the time! And I'm just a business man--oh sure!--I'm no Ph.D. like Littlefield, and no poet, and I haven't anything to spring! Well, let me tell you, just the other day your darn Chum Frink comes up to me at the club begging to know what I thought about the Springfield school-bond issue. And who told him? I did! You bet your life I told him! Little me! I certainly did! He came up and asked me, and I told him all about it!"], "What does Zilla accuse Riesling of doing when Babbitt and Myra visit?": [" Many members of the Athletic Club did go camping without their wives, but they were officially dedicated to fishing and hunting, whereas the sacred and unchangeable sports of Babbitt and Paul Riesling were golfing, motoring, and bridge. For either the fishermen or the golfers to have changed their habits would have been an infraction of their self-imposed discipline which would have shocked all right-thinking and regularized citizens. Babbitt blustered, \u201cWhy don't we just put our foot down and say, 'We're going on ahead of you, and that's all there is to it!' Nothing criminal in it. Simply say to Zilla--\u201d \u201cYou don't say anything to Zilla simply. Why, Georgie, she's almost as much of a moralist as you are, and if I told her the truth she'd believe we were going to meet some dames in New York. And even Myra--she never nags you, the way Zilla does, but she'd worry. She'd say, 'Don't you WANT me to go to Maine with you?", " He mentioned his friends, Lord Wycombe, Colonel Wedgwood, Professor Piccoli. Babbitt had always supposed that Doane associated only with the I. W. W., but now he nodded gravely, as one who knew Lord Wycombes by the score, and he got in two references to Sir Gerald Doak. He felt daring and idealistic and cosmopolitan. Suddenly, in his new spiritual grandeur, he was sorry for Zilla Riesling, and understood her as these ordinary fellows at the Boosters' Club never could. II Five hours after he had arrived in Zenith and told his wife how hot it was in New York, he went to call on Zilla. He was buzzing with ideas and forgiveness. He'd get Paul released; he'd do things, vague but highly benevolent things, for Zilla; he'd be as generous as his friend Seneca Doane. He had not seen Zilla since Paul had shot her, and he still pictured her as buxom, high-colored, lively, and a little blowsy. As he drove up to her boarding-house, in a depressing back street below the wholesale district, he stopped in discomfort.", " Oughtn't to get grouchy like I do. But--Wish I'd been a pioneer, same as my grand-dad. But then, wouldn't have a house like this. I--Oh, gosh, I DON'T KNOW!\u201d He thought moodily of Paul Riesling, of their youth together, of the girls they had known. When Babbitt had graduated from the State University, twenty-four years ago, he had intended to be a lawyer. He had been a ponderous debater in college; he felt that he was an orator; he saw himself becoming governor of the state. While he read law he worked as a real-estate salesman. He saved money, lived in a boarding-house, supped on poached egg on hash. The lively Paul Riesling (who was certainly going off to Europe to study violin, next month or next year) was his refuge till Paul was bespelled by Zilla Colbeck, who laughed and danced and drew men after her plump and gaily wagging finger. Babbitt's evenings were barren then, and he found comfort only in Paul's second cousin, Myra Thompson, a sleek and gentle girl who showed her capacity by agreeing with the ardent young Babbitt that of course he was going to be governor some day.", " Babbitt--vice-president of the Boosters--campaigned for you? Say, have you heard about poor Riesling? Well, I want an order on the warden or whatever you call um of the City Prison to take me back and see him. Good. Thanks.\u201d In fifteen minutes he was pounding down the prison corridor to a cage where Paul Riesling sat on a cot, twisted like an old beggar, legs crossed, arms in a knot, biting at his clenched fist. Paul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell, admitted Babbitt, and left them together. He spoke slowly: \u201cGo on! Be moral!\u201d Babbitt plumped on the couch beside him. \u201cI'm not going to be moral! I don't care what happened! I just want to do anything I can. I'm glad Zilla got what was coming to her.\u201d Paul said argumentatively, \u201cNow, don't go jumping on Zilla. I've been thinking; maybe she hasn't had any too easy a time. Just after I shot her--I didn't hardly mean to, but she got to deviling me so I went crazy, just for a second, and pulled out that old revolver you and I used to shoot rabbits with, and took a crack at her."], "In New York, what does Riesling ask Babbitt to look at with him?": [" But that isn't the point. Culture has become as necessary an adornment and advertisement for a city to-day as pavements or bank-clearances. It's Culture, in theaters and art-galleries and so on, that brings thousands of visitors to New York every year and, to be frank, for all our splendid attainments we haven't yet got the Culture of a New York or Chicago or Boston--or at least we don't get the credit for it. The thing to do then, as a live bunch of go-getters, is to CAPITALIZE CULTURE; to go right out and grab it. \u201cPictures and books are fine for those that have the time to study 'em, but they don't shoot out on the road and holler 'This is what little old Zenith can put up in the way of Culture.' That's precisely what a Symphony Orchestra does do. Look at the credit Minneapolis and Cincinnati get. An orchestra with first-class musickers and a swell conductor--and I believe we ought to do the thing up brown and get one of the highest-paid conductors on the market, providing he ain't a Hun--it goes right into Beantown and New York and Washington; it plays at the best theaters to the most cultured and moneyed people; it gives such class-advertising as a town can get in no other way; and the guy who is so short-sighted as to crab this orchestra proposition is passing up the chance to impress the glorious name of Zenith on some big New York millionaire that might-that might establish a branch factory here!", " He said at last: \u201cLook here, old Paul, you do a lot of talking about kicking things in the face, but you never kick. Why don't you?\u201d \u201cNobody does. Habit too strong. But--Georgie, I've been thinking of one mild bat--oh, don't worry, old pillar of monogamy; it's highly proper. It seems to be settled now, isn't it--though of course Zilla keeps rooting for a nice expensive vacation in New York and Atlantic City, with the bright lights and the bootlegged cocktails and a bunch of lounge-lizards to dance with--but the Babbitts and the Rieslings are sure-enough going to Lake Sunasquam, aren't we? Why couldn't you and I make some excuse--say business in New York--and get up to Maine four or five days before they do, and just loaf by ourselves and smoke and cuss and be natural?\u201d \u201cGreat! Great idea!\u201d Babbitt admired. Not for fourteen years had he taken a holiday without his wife, and neither of them quite believed they could commit this audacity.", " That's where the cop hit me. I suppose cops get a lot of fun out of lecturing murderers, too. He was a big fellow. And they wouldn't let me help carry Zilla down to the ambulance.\u201d \u201cPaul! Quit it! Listen: she won't die, and when it's all over you and I'll go off to Maine again. And maybe we can get that May Arnold to go along. I'll go up to Chicago and ask her. Good woman, by golly. And afterwards I'll see that you get started in business out West somewhere, maybe Seattle--they say that's a lovely city.\u201d Paul was half smiling. It was Babbitt who rambled now. He could not tell whether Paul was heeding, but he droned on till the coming of Paul's lawyer, P. J. Maxwell, a thin, busy, unfriendly man who nodded at Babbitt and hinted, \u201cIf Riesling and I could be alone for a moment--\u201d Babbitt wrung Paul's hands, and waited in the office till Maxwell came pattering out. \u201cLook, old man, what can I do?\u201d he begged.", " \u201cLots of news. Terrible big tornado in the South. Hard luck, all right. But this, say, this is corking! Beginning of the end for those fellows! New York Assembly has passed some bills that ought to completely outlaw the socialists! And there's an elevator-runners' strike in New York and a lot of college boys are taking their places. That's the stuff! And a mass-meeting in Birmingham's demanded that this Mick agitator, this fellow De Valera, be deported. Dead right, by golly! All these agitators paid with German gold anyway. And we got no business interfering with the Irish or any other foreign government. Keep our hands strictly off. And there's another well-authenticated rumor from Russia that Lenin is dead. That's fine. It's beyond me why we don't just step in there and kick those Bolshevik cusses out.\u201d \u201cThat's so,\u201d said Mrs. Babbitt. \u201cAnd it says here a fellow was inaugurated mayor in overalls--a preacher, too!"], "Babbitt is elected as a/an ___ to the annual convention for the State Association of Real Estate Boards.": [" The S. A. R. E. B., as its members called it, with the universal passion for mysterious and important-sounding initials, was the State Association of Real Estate Boards; the organization of brokers and operators. It was to hold its annual convention at Monarch, Zenith's chief rival among the cities of the state. Babbitt was an official delegate; another was Cecil Rountree, whom Babbitt admired for his picaresque speculative building, and hated for his social position, for being present at the smartest dances on Royal Ridge. Rountree was chairman of the convention program-committee. Babbitt had growled to him, \u201cMakes me tired the way these doctors and profs and preachers put on lugs about being 'professional men.' A good realtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of 'em.\u201d \u201cRight you are! I say: Why don't you put that into a paper, and give it at the S. A. R. E. B.?\u201d suggested Rountree.", " His reputation for oratory established, at the dinner of the Zenith Real Estate Board he made the Annual Address. The Advocate-Times reported this speech with unusual fullness: \u201cOne of the livest banquets that has recently been pulled off occurred last night in the annual Get-Together Fest of the Zenith Real Estate Board, held in the Venetian Ball Room of the O'Hearn House. Mine host Gil O'Hearn had as usual done himself proud and those assembled feasted on such an assemblage of plates as could be rivaled nowhere west of New York, if there, and washed down the plenteous feed with the cup which inspired but did not inebriate in the shape of cider from the farm of Chandler Mott, president of the board and who acted as witty and efficient chairman. \u201cAs Mr. Mott was suffering from slight infection and sore throat, G. F. Babbitt made the principal talk. Besides outlining the progress of Torrensing real estate titles, Mr. Babbitt spoke in part as follows: \u201c'In rising to address you, with my impromptu speech carefully tucked into my vest pocket, I am reminded of the story of the two Irishmen, Mike and Pat, who were riding on the Pullman.", " I do love good dance music. I love to dance, don't you, Mr. Babbitt?\u201d \u201cSure, you bet. Not that I'm very darn good at it, though.\u201d \u201cOh, I'm sure you are. You ought to let me teach you. I can teach anybody to dance.\u201d \u201cWould you give me a lesson some time?\u201d \u201cIndeed I would.\u201d \u201cBetter be careful, or I'll be taking you up on that proposition. I'll be coming up to your flat and making you give me that lesson.\u201d \u201cYe-es.\u201d She was not offended, but she was non-committal. He warned himself, \u201cHave some sense now, you chump! Don't go making a fool of yourself again!\u201d and with loftiness he discoursed: \u201cI wish I could dance like some of these young fellows, but I'll tell you: I feel it's a man's place to take a full, you might say, a creative share in the world's work and mold conditions and have something to show for his life, don't you think so?\u201d \u201cOh, I do!\u201d \u201cAnd so I have to sacrifice some of the things I might like to tackle, though I do, by golly, play about as good a game of golf as the next fellow!\u201d \u201cOh, I'm sure you do.... Are you married?\u201d \u201cUh--yes.... And, uh, of course official duties I'm the vice-president of the Boosters' Club, and I'm running one of the committees of the State Association of Real Estate Boards, and that means a lot of work and responsibility--and practically no gratitude for it.\u201d \u201cOh, I know!", " They shouted \u201cThat's the stuff!\u201d and in the discussion afterward they referred with impressiveness to \u201cour friend and brother, Mr. George F. Babbitt.\u201d He had in fifteen minutes changed from a minor delegate to a personage almost as well known as that diplomat of business, Cecil Rountree. After the meeting, delegates from all over the state said, \u201cHower you, Brother Babbitt?\u201d Sixteen complete strangers called him \u201cGeorge,\u201d and three men took him into corners to confide, \u201cMighty glad you had the courage to stand up and give the Profession a real boost.

Rountree was chairman of the convention program-committee. Babbitt had growled to him, \u201cMakes me tired the way these doctors and profs and preachers put on lugs about being 'professional men.' A good realtor has to have more knowledge and finesse than any of 'em.\u201d \u201cRight you are! I say: Why don't you put that into a paper, and give it at the S. A. R. E. B.?\u201d suggested Rountree.", " VI As he rode back to the hotel Babbitt reflected, \u201cMyra would have enjoyed all this social agony.\u201d For himself he cared less for the garden party than for the motor tours which the Monarch Chamber of Commerce had arranged. Indefatigably he viewed water-reservoirs, suburban trolley-stations, and tanneries. He devoured the statistics which were given to him, and marveled to his roommate, W. A. Rogers, \u201cOf course this town isn't a patch on Zenith; it hasn't got our outlook and natural resources; but did you know--I nev' did till to-day--that they manufactured seven hundred and sixty-three million feet of lumber last year? What d' you think of that!\u201d He was nervous as the time for reading his paper approached. When he stood on the low platform before the convention, he trembled and saw only a purple haze. But he was in earnest, and when he had finished the formal paper he talked to them, his hands in his pockets, his spectacled face a flashing disk, like a plate set up on edge in the lamplight.", " He was the busiest man in the convention; he was so busy that he got nothing done whatever. He sat at a marquetry table, in a room littered with crumpled paper and, all day long, town-boosters and lobbyists and orators who wished to lead debates came and whispered to him, whereupon he looked vague, and said rapidly, \u201cYes, yes, that's a fine idea; we'll do that,\u201d and instantly forgot all about it, lighted a cigar and forgot that too, while the telephone rang mercilessly and about him men kept beseeching, \u201cSay, Mr. Chairman--say, Mr. Chairman!\u201d without penetrating his exhausted hearing. In the exhibit-room were plans of the new suburbs of Sparta, pictures of the new state capitol, at Galop de Vache, and large ears of corn with the label, \u201cNature's Gold, from Shelby County, the Garden Spot of God's Own Country.\u201d The real convention consisted of men muttering in hotel bedrooms or in groups amid the badge-spotted crowd in the hotel-lobby, but there was a show of public meetings."], "Who is elected president at the beginning of chapter 14?": [" Come on, let's give him our best long yell!\u201d As they adjourned, a hundred men crushed in to slap his back. He had never known a higher moment. He drove away in a blur of wonder. He lunged into his office, chuckling to Miss McGoun, \u201cWell, I guess you better congratulate your boss! Been elected vice-president of the Boosters!\u201d He was disappointed. She answered only, \u201cYes--Oh, Mrs. Babbitt's been trying to get you on the 'phone.\u201d But the new salesman, Fritz Weilinger, said, \u201cBy golly, chief, say, that's great, that's perfectly great! I'm tickled to death! Congratulations!\u201d Babbitt called the house, and crowed to his wife, \u201cHeard you were trying to get me, Myra. Say, you got to hand it to little Georgie, this time! Better talk careful! You are now addressing the vice-president of the Boosters' Club!\u201d \u201cOh, Georgie--\u201d \u201cPretty nice, huh? Willis Ijams is the new president, but when he's away, little ole Georgie takes the gavel and whoops 'em up and introduces the speakers--no matter if they're the governor himself--and--\u201d \u201cGeorge!", " The purchasing-agent, the first vice-president, and even the president of the Traction Company protested against the Babbitt price. They mentioned their duty toward stockholders, they threatened an appeal to the courts, though somehow the appeal to the courts was never carried out and the officials found it wiser to compromise with Babbitt. Carbon copies of the correspondence are in the company's files, where they may be viewed by any public commission. Just after this Babbitt deposited three thousand dollars in the bank, the purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company bought a five thousand dollar car, the first vice-president built a home in Devon Woods, and the president was appointed minister to a foreign country. To obtain the options, to tie up one man's land without letting his neighbor know, had been an unusual strain on Babbitt. It was necessary to introduce rumors about planning garages and stores, to pretend that he wasn't taking any more options, to wait and look as bored as a poker-player at a time when the failure to secure a key-lot threatened his whole plan.", " At the end he sighed, \u201cHang it, I'm just beginning to enjoy my vacation. But, well, I feel a lot better. And it's going to be one great year! Maybe the Real Estate Board will elect me president, instead of some fuzzy old-fashioned faker like Chan Mott.\u201d On the way home, whenever he went into the smoking-compartment he felt guilty at deserting his wife and angry at being expected to feel guilty, but each time he triumphed, \u201cOh, this is going to be a great year, a great old year!\u201d CHAPTER XII I ALL the way home from Maine, Babbitt was certain that he was a changed man. He was converted to serenity. He was going to cease worrying about business. He was going to have more \u201cinterests\u201d--theaters, public affairs, reading. And suddenly, as he finished an especially heavy cigar, he was going to stop smoking. He invented a new and perfect method. He would buy no tobacco; he would depend on borrowing it; and, of course, he would be ashamed to borrow often.", " It was not officially recognized even by himself.

He wore a cotton handkerchief about his collar; he became sweaty; he opened his mouth in a wide loose grin; and drank lemon soda out of a bottle. He went to the Game three times a week, for one week. Then he compromised on watching the Advocate-Times bulletin-board. He stood in the thickest and steamiest of the crowd, and as the boy up on the lofty platform recorded the achievements of Big Bill Bostwick, the pitcher, Babbitt remarked to complete strangers, \u201cPretty nice! Good work!\u201d and hastened back to the office. He honestly believed that he loved baseball. It is true that he hadn't, in twenty-five years, himself played any baseball except back-lot catch with Ted--very gentle, and strictly limited to ten minutes."], "On what does Babbitt place his hopes for social advancement?": [" CHAPTER XV HIS march to greatness was not without disastrous stumbling. Fame did not bring the social advancement which the Babbitts deserved. They were not asked to join the Tonawanda Country Club nor invited to the dances at the Union. Himself, Babbitt fretted, he didn't \u201ccare a fat hoot for all these highrollers, but the wife would kind of like to be Among Those Present.\u201d He nervously awaited his university class-dinner and an evening of furious intimacy with such social leaders as Charles McKelvey the millionaire contractor, Max Kruger the banker, Irving Tate the tool-manufacturer, and Adelbert Dobson the fashionable interior decorator. Theoretically he was their friend, as he had been in college, and when he encountered them they still called him \u201cGeorgie,\u201d but he didn't seem to encounter them often, and they never invited him to dinner (with champagne and a butler) at their houses on Royal Ridge.", " Babbitt squeezed among them. He liked McKelvey's smile as much as the social advancement to be had from his favor. If in Paul's company he felt ponderous and protective, with McKelvey he felt slight and adoring. He heard McKelvey say to Max Kruger, the banker, \u201cYes, we'll put up Sir Gerald Doak.\u201d Babbitt's democratic love for titles became a rich relish. \u201cYou know, he's one of the biggest iron-men in England, Max. Horribly well-off.... Why, hello, old Georgie! Say, Max, George Babbitt is getting fatter than I am!\u201d The chairman shouted, \u201cTake your seats, fellows!\u201d \u201cShall we make a move, Charley?\u201d Babbitt said casually to McKelvey. \u201cRight. Hello, Paul! How's the old fiddler? Planning to sit anywhere special, George? Come on, let's grab some seats. Come on, Max. Georgie, I read about your speeches in the campaign. Bully work!\u201d After that, Babbitt would have followed him through fire. He was enormously busy during the dinner, now bumblingly cheering Paul, now approaching McKelvey with \u201cHear, you're going to build some piers in Brooklyn,\u201d now noting how enviously the failures of the class, sitting by themselves in a weedy group, looked up to him in his association with the nobility, now warming himself in the Society Talk of McKelvey and Max Kruger.", " But the Good Citizens' League, the G. C. L., they stick right to it. Oh, the G. C. L. has to have some other ostensible purposes--frinstance here in Zenith I think it ought to support the park-extension project and the City Planning Committee--and then, too, it should have a social aspect, being made up of the best people--have dances and so on, especially as one of the best ways it can put the kibosh on cranks is to apply this social boycott business to folks big enough so you can't reach 'em otherwise. Then if that don't work, the G. C. L. can finally send a little delegation around to inform folks that get too flip that they got to conform to decent standards and quit shooting off their mouths so free. Don't it sound like the organization could do a great work? We've already got some of the strongest men in town, and of course we want you in. How about it?\u201d Babbitt was uncomfortable. He felt a compulsion back to all the standards he had so vaguely yet so desperately been fleeing.", " He bowed in flustered obedience. So did Chum Frink. Eathorne rang for the maid. The modern and luxurious Babbitt had never seen any one ring for a servant in a private house, except during meals. Himself, in hotels, had rung for bell-boys, but in the house you didn't hurt Matilda's feelings; you went out in the hall and shouted for her. Nor had he, since prohibition, known any one to be casual about drinking. It was extraordinary merely to sip his toddy and not cry, \u201cOh, maaaaan, this hits me right where I live!\u201d And always, with the ecstasy of youth meeting greatness, he marveled, \u201cThat little fuzzy-face there, why, he could make me or break me! If he told my banker to call my loans--! Gosh! That quarter-sized squirt! And looking like he hadn't got a single bit of hustle to him! I wonder--Do we Boosters throw too many fits about pep?\u201d From this thought he shuddered away, and listened devoutly to Eathorne's ideas on the advancement of the Sunday School, which were very clear and very bad."], "Who invites a reluctant Babbitt and Myra over for a failure of a dinner?": [" He seemed kind and insignificant, and as lonely as Babbitt himself. He wore a tweed suit and a reluctant orange tie. It came to Babbitt with a pyrotechnic crash. The melancholy stranger was Sir Gerald Doak. Instinctively Babbitt rose, bumbling, \u201cHow 're you, Sir Gerald? 'Member we met in Zenith, at Charley McKelvey's? Babbitt's my name--real estate.\u201d \u201cOh! How d' you do.\u201d Sir Gerald shook hands flabbily. Embarrassed, standing, wondering how he could retreat, Babbitt maundered, \u201cWell, I suppose you been having a great trip since we saw you in Zenith.\u201d \u201cQuite. British Columbia and California and all over the place,\u201d he said doubtfully, looking at Babbitt lifelessly. \u201cHow did you find business conditions in British Columbia? Or I suppose maybe you didn't look into 'em. Scenery and sport and so on?\u201d \u201cScenery? Oh, capital. But business conditions--You know, Mr. Babbitt, they're having almost as much unemployment as we are.\u201d Sir Gerald was speaking warmly now.", " He told his best Irish story, but it sank like soggy cake. Most bleary moment of all was when Mrs. Overbrook, peering out of her fog of nursing eight children and cooking and scrubbing, tried to be conversational. \u201cI suppose you go to Chicago and New York right along, Mr. Babbitt,\u201d she prodded. \u201cWell, I get to Chicago fairly often.\u201d \u201cIt must be awfully interesting. I suppose you take in all the theaters.\u201d \u201cWell, to tell the truth, Mrs. Overbrook, thing that hits me best is a great big beefsteak at a Dutch restaurant in the Loop!\u201d They had nothing more to say. Babbitt was sorry, but there was no hope; the dinner was a failure. At ten, rousing out of the stupor of meaningless talk, he said as cheerily as he could, \u201c'Fraid we got to be starting, Ed. I've got a fellow coming to see me early to-morrow.\u201d As Overbrook helped him with his coat, Babbitt said, \u201cNice to rub up on the old days! We must have lunch together, P.D.Q.\u201d Mrs. Babbitt sighed, on their drive home, \u201cIt was pretty terrible.", " All the week before the class-dinner he thought of them. \u201cNo reason why we shouldn't become real chummy now!\u201d II Like all true American diversions and spiritual outpourings, the dinner of the men of the Class of 1896 was thoroughly organized. The dinner-committee hammered like a sales-corporation. Once a week they sent out reminders: TICKLER NO. 3 Old man, are you going to be with us at the livest Friendship Feed the alumni of the good old U have ever known? The alumnae of '08 turned out 60% strong. Are we boys going to be beaten by a bunch of skirts? Come on, fellows, let's work up some real genuine enthusiasm and all boost together for the snappiest dinner yet! Elegant eats, short ginger-talks, and memories shared together of the brightest, gladdest days of life. The dinner was held in a private room at the Union Club. The club was a dingy building, three pretentious old dwellings knocked together, and the entrance-hall resembled a potato cellar, yet the Babbitt who was free of the magnificence of the Athletic Club entered with embarrassment.", " \u201cMight as well go and get it over,\u201d Babbitt groaned to his wife. \u201cBut don't it simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn't know the first thing about social etiquette? Think of him 'phoning me, instead of his wife sitting down and writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we're stuck for it. That's the trouble with all this class-brother hooptedoodle.\u201d He accepted Overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for an evening two weeks off. A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester. It was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at six-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven. Babbitt permitted himself to be ten minutes late."], "What does Eunice Littlefield, Ted\u2019s girlfriend, have a deep passion for?": [" Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time whisky, but then, it was only twice-- Dr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in. He had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and Eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped. He called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield explained to Babbitt that Eunice's mother had a headache and needed her. She went off in tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. \u201cThat little devil! Getting Ted into trouble! And Littlefield, the conceited old gas-bag, acting like it was Ted that was the bad influence!\u201d Later he smelled whisky on Ted's breath. After the civil farewell to the guests, the row was terrific, a thorough Family Scene, like an avalanche, devastating and without reticences. Babbitt thundered, Mrs. Babbitt wept, Ted was unconvincingly defiant, and Verona in confusion as to whose side she was taking.", " But she remained awake and worrying while Babbitt, on the sleeping-porch, struggled back into sleep through the incessant soft rain of her remarks. It was after dawn when he was aroused by her shaking him and calling \u201cGeorge! George!\u201d in something like horror. \u201cWha--wha--what is it?\u201d \u201cCome here quick and see. Be quiet!\u201d She led him down the hall to the door of Ted's room and pushed it gently open. On the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rose-colored chiffon lingerie; on the sedate Morris chair a girl's silver slipper. And on the pillows were two sleepy heads--Ted's and Eunice's. Ted woke to grin, and to mutter with unconvincing defiance, \u201cGood morning! Let me introduce my wife--Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Eunice Littlefield Babbitt, Esquiress.\u201d \u201cGood God!\u201d from Babbitt, and from his wife a long wailing, \u201cYou've gone and--\u201d \u201cWe got married last evening. Wife! Sit up and say a pretty good morning to mother-in-law.\u201d But Eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the pillow.", " He awed Babbitt by confessing that he often sat up till midnight reading the figures and footnotes in Government reports, or skimming (with amusement at the author's mistakes) the latest volumes of chemistry, archeology, and ichthyology. But Littlefield's great value was as a spiritual example. Despite his strange learnings he was as strict a Presbyterian and as firm a Republican as George F. Babbitt. He confirmed the business men in the faith. Where they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of industry and manners was perfect, Dr. Howard Littlefield proved it to them, out of history, economics, and the confessions of reformed radicals. Babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a savant, and in Ted's intimacy with Eunice Littlefield. At sixteen Eunice was interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages and salaries of motion-picture stars, but--as Babbitt definitively put it--\u201cshe was her father's daughter.\u201d The difference between a light man like Sam Doppelbrau and a really fine character like Littlefield was revealed in their appearances.", " Sometimes, in the veiled life of his dreams, when the fairy child came running to him she took on the semblance of Eunice Littlefield. Ted was motor-mad as Eunice was movie-mad. A thousand sarcastic refusals did not check his teasing for a car of his own. However lax he might be about early rising and the prosody of Vergil, he was tireless in tinkering. With three other boys he bought a rheumatic Ford chassis, built an amazing racer-body out of tin and pine, went skidding round corners in the perilous craft, and sold it at a profit. Babbitt gave him a motor-cycle, and every Saturday afternoon, with seven sandwiches and a bottle of Coca-Cola in his pockets, and Eunice perched eerily on the rumble seat, he went roaring off to distant towns. Usually Eunice and he were merely neighborhood chums, and quarreled with a wholesome and violent lack of delicacy; but now and then, after the color and scent of a dance, they were silent together and a little furtive, and Babbitt was worried."], "What does Babbitt want Ted to study after school?": [" This September Ted had entered the State University as a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences. The university was at Mohalis only fifteen miles from Zenith, and Ted often came down for the week-end. Babbitt was worried. Ted was \u201cgoing in for\u201d everything but books. He had tried to \u201cmake\u201d the football team as a light half-back, he was looking forward to the basket-ball season, he was on the committee for the Freshman Hop, and (as a Zenithite, an aristocrat among the yokels) he was being \u201crushed\u201d by two fraternities. But of his studies Babbitt could learn nothing save a mumbled, \u201cOh, gosh, these old stiffs of teachers just give you a lot of junk about literature and economics.\u201d One week-end Ted proposed, \u201cSay, Dad, why can't I transfer over from the College to the School of Engineering and take mechanical engineering? You always holler that I never study, but honest, I would study there.\u201d \u201cNo, the Engineering School hasn't got the standing the College has,\u201d fretted Babbitt.", " Personally, I don't see myself why they stuck 'em into an up-to-date high-school system like we have in this state. Be a good deal better if you took Business English, and learned how to write an ad, or letters that would pull. But there it is, and there's no talk, argument, or discussion about it! Trouble with you, Ted, is you always want to do something different! If you're going to law-school--and you are!--I never had a chance to, but I'll see that you do--why, you'll want to lay in all the English and Latin you can get.\u201d \u201cOh punk. I don't see what's the use of law-school--or even finishing high school. I don't want to go to college 'specially. Honest, there's lot of fellows that have graduated from colleges that don't begin to make as much money as fellows that went to work early. Old Shimmy Peters, that teaches Latin in the High, he's a what-is-it from Columbia and he sits up all night reading a lot of greasy books and he's always spieling about the 'value of languages,' and the poor soak doesn't make but eighteen hundred a year, and no traveling salesman would think of working for that.", " Can't get your fist onto 'em. Half cold, anyway!\u201d Ted Babbitt, junior in the great East Side High School, had been making hiccup-like sounds of interruption. He blurted now, \u201cSay, Rone, you going to--\u201d Verona whirled. \u201cTed! Will you kindly not interrupt us when we're talking about serious matters!\u201d \u201cAw punk,\u201d said Ted judicially. \u201cEver since somebody slipped up and let you out of college, Ammonia, you been pulling these nut conversations about what-nots and so-on-and-so-forths. Are you going to--I want to use the car tonight.\u201d Babbitt snorted, \u201cOh, you do! May want it myself!\u201d Verona protested, \u201cOh, you do, Mr. Smarty! I'm going to take it myself!\u201d Tinka wailed, \u201cOh, papa, you said maybe you'd drive us down to Rosedale!\u201d and Mrs. Babbitt, \u201cCareful, Tinka, your sleeve is in the butter.\u201d They glared, and Verona hurled, \u201cTed, you're a perfect pig about the car!\u201d \u201cCourse you're not! Not a-tall!\u201d Ted could be maddeningly bland.", " Ted negotiated: \u201cGee, honest, Rone, I don't want to take the old boat, but I promised couple o' girls in my class I'd drive 'em down to the rehearsal of the school chorus, and, gee, I don't want to, but a gentleman's got to keep his social engagements.\u201d \u201cWell, upon my word! You and your social engagements! In high school!\u201d \u201cOh, ain't we select since we went to that hen college! Let me tell you there isn't a private school in the state that's got as swell a bunch as we got in Gamma Digamma this year. There's two fellows that their dads are millionaires. Say, gee, I ought to have a car of my own, like lots of the fellows.\u201d Babbitt almost rose. \u201cA car of your own! Don't you want a yacht, and a house and lot? That pretty nearly takes the cake! A boy that can't pass his Latin examinations, like any other boy ought to, and he expects me to give him a motor-car, and I suppose a chauffeur, and an areoplane maybe, as a reward for the hard work he puts in going to the movies with Eunice Littlefield!"], "When Howard Littlefield checks on Ted\u2019s party, what is he horrified to see Ted and Eunice doing?": [" Twice he caught the reek of prohibition-time whisky, but then, it was only twice-- Dr. Howard Littlefield lumbered in. He had come, in a mood of solemn parental patronage, to look on. Ted and Eunice were dancing, moving together like one body. Littlefield gasped. He called Eunice. There was a whispered duologue, and Littlefield explained to Babbitt that Eunice's mother had a headache and needed her. She went off in tears. Babbitt looked after them furiously. \u201cThat little devil! Getting Ted into trouble! And Littlefield, the conceited old gas-bag, acting like it was Ted that was the bad influence!\u201d Later he smelled whisky on Ted's breath. After the civil farewell to the guests, the row was terrific, a thorough Family Scene, like an avalanche, devastating and without reticences. Babbitt thundered, Mrs. Babbitt wept, Ted was unconvincingly defiant, and Verona in confusion as to whose side she was taking.", " They two had not returned when the Babbitts went to bed, at half-past eleven. At a blurred indefinite time of late night Babbitt was awakened by the ring of the telephone and gloomily crawled down-stairs. Howard Littlefield was speaking: \u201cGeorge, Euny isn't back yet. Is Ted?\u201d \u201cNo--at least his door is open--\u201d \u201cThey ought to be home. Eunice said the dance would be over at midnight. What's the name of those people where they're going?\u201d \u201cWhy, gosh, tell the truth, I don't know, Howard. It's some classmate of Ted's, out in Devon Woods. Don't see what we can do. Wait, I'll skip up and ask Myra if she knows their name.\u201d Babbitt turned on the light in Ted's room. It was a brown boyish room; disordered dresser, worn books, a high-school pennant, photographs of basket-ball teams and baseball teams. Ted was decidedly not there. Mrs. Babbitt, awakened, irritably observed that she certainly did not know the name of Ted's host, that it was late, that Howard Littlefield was but little better than a born fool, and that she was sleepy.", " But she remained awake and worrying while Babbitt, on the sleeping-porch, struggled back into sleep through the incessant soft rain of her remarks. It was after dawn when he was aroused by her shaking him and calling \u201cGeorge! George!\u201d in something like horror. \u201cWha--wha--what is it?\u201d \u201cCome here quick and see. Be quiet!\u201d She led him down the hall to the door of Ted's room and pushed it gently open. On the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rose-colored chiffon lingerie; on the sedate Morris chair a girl's silver slipper. And on the pillows were two sleepy heads--Ted's and Eunice's. Ted woke to grin, and to mutter with unconvincing defiance, \u201cGood morning! Let me introduce my wife--Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt Eunice Littlefield Babbitt, Esquiress.\u201d \u201cGood God!\u201d from Babbitt, and from his wife a long wailing, \u201cYou've gone and--\u201d \u201cWe got married last evening. Wife! Sit up and say a pretty good morning to mother-in-law.\u201d But Eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the pillow.", " They danced in one evening when Ted was home from the university, and Ted chuckled, \u201cWhat's this I hear from Euny, dad? She says her dad says you raised Cain by boosting old Seneca Doane. Hot dog! Give 'em fits! Stir 'em up! This old burg is asleep!\u201d Eunice plumped down on Babbitt's lap, kissed him, nestled her bobbed hair against his chin, and crowed; \u201cI think you're lots nicer than Howard. Why is it,\u201d confidentially, \u201cthat Howard is such an old grouch? The man has a good heart, and honestly, he's awfully bright, but he never will learn to step on the gas, after all the training I've given him. Don't you think we could do something with him, dearest?\u201d \u201cWhy, Eunice, that isn't a nice way to speak of your papa,\u201d Babbitt observed, in the best Floral Heights manner, but he was happy for the first time in weeks. He pictured himself as the veteran liberal strengthened by the loyalty of the young generation."], "How does Babbitt feel about family matters after a visit from his mother and half-brother Martin's family?": [" and with that he drove on and left the fellow standing there in the road like a bump on a log!\u201d Babbitt was most exasperated when she revealed his boyhood to the children. He had, it seemed, been fond of barley-sugar; had worn the \u201cloveliest little pink bow in his curls\u201d and corrupted his own name to \u201cGoo-goo.\u201d He heard (though he did not officially hear) Ted admonishing Tinka, \u201cCome on now, kid; stick the lovely pink bow in your curls and beat it down to breakfast, or Goo-goo will jaw your head off.\u201d Babbitt's half-brother, Martin, with his wife and youngest baby, came down from Catawba for two days. Martin bred cattle and ran the dusty general-store. He was proud of being a freeborn independent American of the good old Yankee stock; he was proud of being honest, blunt, ugly, and disagreeable. His favorite remark was \u201cHow much did you pay for that?\u201d He regarded Verona's books, Babbitt's silver pencil, and flowers on the table as citified extravagances, and said so.", " I mean--it's so lacking in refinement, but--And Mother wants to come and stay with me for a whole month, and of course I do love her, I suppose I do, but honestly, she'll cramp my style something dreadful--she never can learn not to comment, and she always wants to know where I'm going when I go out evenings, and if I lie to her she always spies around and ferrets around and finds out where I've been, and then she looks like Patience on a Monument till I could just scream. And oh, I MUST tell you--You know I never talk about myself; I just hate people who do, don't you? But--I feel so stupid to-night, and I know I must be boring you with all this but--What would you do about Mother?\u201d He gave her facile masculine advice. She was to put off her mother's stay. She was to tell Carrie to go to the deuce. For these valuable revelations she thanked him, and they ambled into the familiar gossip of the Bunch.", " When the proper opportunity and occasion arises so it just comes in natural, why then I'll have a friendly little talk with him and--and--Was that Tinka hollering up-stairs? She ought to been asleep, long ago.\u201d He prowled through the living-room, and stood in the sun-parlor, that glass-walled room of wicker chairs and swinging couch in which they loafed on Sunday afternoons. Outside only the lights of Doppelbrau's house and the dim presence of Babbitt's favorite elm broke the softness of April night. \u201cGood visit with the boy. Getting over feeling cranky, way I did this morning. And restless. Though, by golly, I will have a few days alone with Paul in Maine! . . . That devil Zilla! . . . But . . . Ted's all right. Whole family all right. And good business. Not many fellows make four hundred and fifty bucks, practically half of a thousand dollars easy as I did to-day! Maybe when we all get to rowing it's just as much my fault as it is theirs.", " I make eight thousand a year to his seven! But I don't blow it all in and waste it and throw it around, the way he does! Don't believe in this business of going and spending a whole lot of money to show off and--\u201d They went, with ardor and some thoroughness, into the matters of streamline bodies, hill-climbing power, wire wheels, chrome steel, ignition systems, and body colors. It was much more than a study of transportation. It was an aspiration for knightly rank. In the city of Zenith, in the barbarous twentieth century, a family's motor indicated its social rank as precisely as the grades of the peerage determined the rank of an English family--indeed, more precisely, considering the opinion of old county families upon newly created brewery barons and woolen-mill viscounts. The details of precedence were never officially determined. There was no court to decide whether the second son of a Pierce Arrow limousine should go in to dinner before the first son of a Buick roadster, but of their respective social importance there was no doubt; and where Babbitt as a boy had aspired to the presidency, his son Ted aspired to a Packard twin-six and an established position in the motored gentry."], "What does the Street Traction Company want to build on the land Babbitt extorts a high price for?": [" The purchasing-agent, the first vice-president, and even the president of the Traction Company protested against the Babbitt price. They mentioned their duty toward stockholders, they threatened an appeal to the courts, though somehow the appeal to the courts was never carried out and the officials found it wiser to compromise with Babbitt. Carbon copies of the correspondence are in the company's files, where they may be viewed by any public commission. Just after this Babbitt deposited three thousand dollars in the bank, the purchasing-agent of the Street Traction Company bought a five thousand dollar car, the first vice-president built a home in Devon Woods, and the president was appointed minister to a foreign country. To obtain the options, to tie up one man's land without letting his neighbor know, had been an unusual strain on Babbitt. It was necessary to introduce rumors about planning garages and stores, to pretend that he wasn't taking any more options, to wait and look as bored as a poker-player at a time when the failure to secure a key-lot threatened his whole plan.", " Mechanical golf and dinner-parties and bridge and conversation. Save with Paul Riesling, mechanical friendships--back-slapping and jocular, never daring to essay the test of quietness. He turned uneasily in bed. He saw the years, the brilliant winter days and all the long sweet afternoons which were meant for summery meadows, lost in such brittle pretentiousness. He thought of telephoning about leases, of cajoling men he hated, of making business calls and waiting in dirty anterooms--hat on knee, yawning at fly-specked calendars, being polite to office-boys. \u201cI don't hardly want to go back to work,\u201d he prayed. \u201cI'd like to--I don't know.\u201d But he was back next day, busy and of doubtful temper. CHAPTER XIX I THE Zenith Street Traction Company planned to build car-repair shops in the suburb of Dorchester, but when they came to buy the land they found it held, on options, by the Babbitt-Thompson Realty Company.", " Babbitt boomed on: \u201cPretty punk service the Company giving us on these car-lines. Nonsense to only run the Portland Road cars once every seven minutes. Fellow gets mighty cold on a winter morning, waiting on a street corner with the wind nipping at his ankles.\u201d \u201cThat's right. The Street Car Company don't care a damn what kind of a deal they give us. Something ought to happen to 'em.\u201d Babbitt was alarmed. \u201cBut still, of course it won't do to just keep knocking the Traction Company and not realize the difficulties they're operating under, like these cranks that want municipal ownership. The way these workmen hold up the Company for high wages is simply a crime, and of course the burden falls on you and me that have to pay a seven-cent fare! Fact, there's remarkable service on all their lines--considering.\u201d \u201cWell--\u201d uneasily. \u201cDarn fine morning,\u201d Babbitt explained. \u201cSpring coming along fast.\u201d \u201cYes, it's real spring now.\u201d The victim had no originality, no wit, and Babbitt fell into a great silence and devoted himself to the game of beating trolley cars to the corner: a spurt, a tail-chase, nervous speeding between the huge yellow side of the trolley and the jagged row of parked motors, shooting past just as the trolley stopped--a rare game and valiant.", " Babbitt waved and cried, \u201cMornin'!\u201d Eathorne looked at him deliberately, hesitated, and gave him a nod more contemptuous than a direct cut. Babbitt's partner and father-in-law came in at ten: \u201cGeorge, what's this I hear about some song and dance you gave Colonel Snow about not wanting to join the G.C.L.? What the dickens you trying to do? Wreck the firm? You don't suppose these Big Guns will stand your bucking them and springing all this 'liberal' poppycock you been getting off lately, do you?\u201d \u201cOh, rats, Henry T., you been reading bum fiction. There ain't any such a thing as these plots to keep folks from being liberal. This is a free country. A man can do anything he wants to.\u201d \u201cCourse th' ain't any plots. Who said they was? Only if folks get an idea you're scatter-brained and unstable, you don't suppose they'll want to do business with you, do you? One little rumor about your being a crank would do more to ruin this business than all the plots and stuff that these fool story-writers could think up in a month of Sundays.\u201d That afternoon, when the old reliable Conrad Lyte, the merry miser, Conrad Lyte, appeared, and Babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land in the new residential section of Dorchester, Lyte said hastily, too hastily, \u201cNo, no, don't want to go into anything new just now.\u201d A week later Babbitt learned, through Henry Thompson, that the officials of the Street Traction Company were planning another real-estate coup, and that Sanders, Torrey and Wing, not the Babbitt-Thompson Company, were to handle it for them."], "To what position is Babbitt elected at the Booster's club?": [" And--Certainly looks nice there. Certainly is a mighty clever little jigger. Gives the last touch of refinement and class. I--By golly, I guess I can afford it if I want to! Not going to be the only member of this family that never has a single doggone luxury!\u201d Thus, laden with treasure, after three and a half blocks of romantic adventure, he drove up to the club. III The Zenith Athletic Club is not athletic and it isn't exactly a club, but it is Zenith in perfection. It has an active and smoke-misted billiard room, it is represented by baseball and football teams, and in the pool and the gymnasium a tenth of the members sporadically try to reduce. But most of its three thousand members use it as a cafe in which to lunch, play cards, tell stories, meet customers, and entertain out-of town uncles at dinner. It is the largest club in the city, and its chief hatred is the conservative Union Club, which all sound members of the Athletic call \u201ca rotten, snobbish, dull, expensive old hole--not one Good Mixer in the place--you couldn't hire me to join.\u201d Statistics show that no member of the Athletic has ever refused election to the Union, and of those who are elected, sixty-seven per cent.", " But even this sinking into peace was less consoling than his return to being one of the best-loved men in the Boosters' Club. IV President Willis Ijams began that Boosters' Club luncheon by standing quiet and staring at them so unhappily that they feared he was about to announce the death of a Brother Booster. He spoke slowly then, and gravely: \u201cBoys, I have something shocking to reveal to you; something terrible about one of our own members.\u201d Several Boosters, including Babbitt, looked disconcerted. \u201cA knight of the grip, a trusted friend of mine, recently made a trip up-state, and in a certain town, where a certain Booster spent his boyhood, he found out something which can no longer be concealed. In fact, he discovered the inward nature of a man whom we have accepted as a Real Guy and as one of us. Gentlemen, I cannot trust my voice to say it, so I have written it down.\u201d He uncovered a large blackboard and on it, in huge capitals, was the legend: George Follansbee Babbitt--oh you Folly!", " On the way back Babbitt picked up his partner and father-in-law, Henry T. Thompson, at his kitchen-cabinet works, and they drove through South Zenith, a high-colored, banging, exciting region: new factories of hollow tile with gigantic wire-glass windows, surly old red-brick factories stained with tar, high-perched water-tanks, big red trucks like locomotives, and, on a score of hectic side-tracks, far-wandering freight-cars from the New York Central and apple orchards, the Great Northern and wheat-plateaus, the Southern Pacific and orange groves. They talked to the secretary of the Zenith Foundry Company about an interesting artistic project--a cast-iron fence for Linden Lane Cemetery. They drove on to the Zeeco Motor Company and interviewed the sales-manager, Noel Ryland, about a discount on a Zeeco car for Thompson. Babbitt and Ryland were fellow-members of the Boosters' Club, and no Booster felt right if he bought anything from another Booster without receiving a discount.", " Come on, let's give him our best long yell!\u201d As they adjourned, a hundred men crushed in to slap his back. He had never known a higher moment. He drove away in a blur of wonder. He lunged into his office, chuckling to Miss McGoun, \u201cWell, I guess you better congratulate your boss! Been elected vice-president of the Boosters!\u201d He was disappointed. She answered only, \u201cYes--Oh, Mrs. Babbitt's been trying to get you on the 'phone.\u201d But the new salesman, Fritz Weilinger, said, \u201cBy golly, chief, say, that's great, that's perfectly great! I'm tickled to death! Congratulations!\u201d Babbitt called the house, and crowed to his wife, \u201cHeard you were trying to get me, Myra. Say, you got to hand it to little Georgie, this time! Better talk careful! You are now addressing the vice-president of the Boosters' Club!\u201d \u201cOh, Georgie--\u201d \u201cPretty nice, huh? Willis Ijams is the new president, but when he's away, little ole Georgie takes the gavel and whoops 'em up and introduces the speakers--no matter if they're the governor himself--and--\u201d \u201cGeorge!"], "What crime has Riesling been arrested for, according to Myra?": [" Oughtn't to get grouchy like I do. But--Wish I'd been a pioneer, same as my grand-dad. But then, wouldn't have a house like this. I--Oh, gosh, I DON'T KNOW!\u201d He thought moodily of Paul Riesling, of their youth together, of the girls they had known. When Babbitt had graduated from the State University, twenty-four years ago, he had intended to be a lawyer. He had been a ponderous debater in college; he felt that he was an orator; he saw himself becoming governor of the state. While he read law he worked as a real-estate salesman. He saved money, lived in a boarding-house, supped on poached egg on hash. The lively Paul Riesling (who was certainly going off to Europe to study violin, next month or next year) was his refuge till Paul was bespelled by Zilla Colbeck, who laughed and danced and drew men after her plump and gaily wagging finger. Babbitt's evenings were barren then, and he found comfort only in Paul's second cousin, Myra Thompson, a sleek and gentle girl who showed her capacity by agreeing with the ardent young Babbitt that of course he was going to be governor some day.", " A condensed-milk plant was set afire--each side charged it to the other--and the city was hysterical. And Babbitt chose this time to be publicly liberal. He belonged to the sound, sane, right-thinking wing, and at first he agreed that the Crooked Agitators ought to be shot. He was sorry when his friend, Seneca Doane, defended arrested strikers, and he thought of going to Doane and explaining about these agitators, but when he read a broadside alleging that even on their former wages the telephone girls had been hungry, he was troubled. \u201cAll lies and fake figures,\u201d he said, but in a doubtful croak. For the Sunday after, the Chatham Road Presbyterian Church announced a sermon by Dr. John Jennison Drew on \u201cHow the Saviour Would End Strikes.\u201d Babbitt had been negligent about church-going lately, but he went to the service, hopeful that Dr. Drew really did have the information as to what the divine powers thought about strikes.", " Bad luck, old dear, and you can stick your job up the sewer!\u201d Babbitt sat for a long time, alternately raging, \u201cI'll have him arrested,\u201d and yearning \u201cI wonder--No, I've never done anything that wasn't necessary to keep the Wheels of Progress moving.\u201d Next day he hired in Graff's place Fritz Weilinger, the salesman of his most injurious rival, the East Side Homes and Development Company, and thus at once annoyed his competitor and acquired an excellent man. Young Fritz was a curly-headed, merry, tennis-playing youngster. He made customers welcome to the office. Babbitt thought of him as a son, and in him had much comfort. III An abandoned race-track on the outskirts of Chicago, a plot excellent for factory sites, was to be sold, and Jake Offut asked Babbitt to bid on it for him. The strain of the Street Traction deal and his disappointment in Stanley Graff had so shaken Babbitt that he found it hard to sit at his desk and concentrate.", " Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried, \u201cSee you later, boys,\u201d and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then, neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference, nor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic Club. He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him, admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women. Paul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had been parted three years, not three days--and they said: \u201cHow's the old horse-thief?\u201d \u201cAll right, I guess. How're you, you poor shrimp?\u201d \u201cI'm first-rate, you second-hand hunk o' cheese.\u201d Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, \u201cYou're a fine guy, you are! Ten minutes late!\u201d Riesling snapped, \u201cWell, you're lucky to have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!\u201d They grinned and went into the Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before their own images in the massy mirror."], "What does Babbitt offer to do to help Riesling?": [" But the crusading passion of it made him so tobacco-hungry that he immediately recovered the key, walked with forbidding dignity to the file, took out a cigar and a match--\u201cbut only one match; if ole cigar goes out, it'll by golly have to stay out!\u201d Later, when the cigar did go out, he took one more match from the file, and when a buyer and a seller came in for a conference at eleven-thirty, naturally he had to offer them cigars. His conscience protested, \u201cWhy, you're smoking with them!\u201d but he bullied it, \u201cOh, shut up! I'm busy now. Of course by-and-by--\u201d There was no by-and-by, yet his belief that he had crushed the unclean habit made him feel noble and very happy. When he called up Paul Riesling he was, in his moral splendor, unusually eager. He was fonder of Paul Riesling than of any one on earth except himself and his daughter Tinka. They had been classmates, roommates, in the State University, but always he thought of Paul Riesling, with his dark slimness, his precisely parted hair, his nose-glasses, his hesitant speech, his moodiness, his love of music, as a younger brother, to be petted and protected.", " Yes, I suppose it would be perjury. Oh--Would it help?\u201d \u201cBut, my dear fellow! Perjury!\u201d \u201cOh, don't be a fool! Excuse me, Maxwell; I didn't mean to get your goat. I just mean: I've known and you've known many and many a case of perjury, just to annex some rotten little piece of real estate, and here where it's a case of saving Paul from going to prison, I'd perjure myself black in the face.\u201d \u201cNo. Aside from the ethics of the matter, I'm afraid it isn't practicable. The prosecutor would tear your testimony to pieces. It's known that only Riesling and his wife were there at the time.\u201d \u201cThen, look here! Let me go on the stand and swear--and this would be the God's truth--that she pestered him till he kind of went crazy.\u201d \u201cNo. Sorry. Riesling absolutely refuses to have any testimony reflecting on his wife. He insists on pleading guilty.\u201d \u201cThen let me get up and testify something--whatever you say.", " Always! They say you're a scolding old woman. Old, by God!\u201d That cowardly attack broke her. Her eyes were blank. She wept. But Babbitt glared stolidly. He felt that he was the all-powerful official in charge; that Paul and Mrs. Babbitt looked on him with awe; that he alone could handle this case. Zilla writhed. She begged, \u201cOh, they don't!\u201d \u201cThey certainly do!\u201d \u201cI've been a bad woman! I'm terribly sorry! I'll kill myself! I'll do anything. Oh, I'll--What do you want?\u201d She abased herself completely. Also, she enjoyed it. To the connoisseur of scenes, nothing is more enjoyable than a thorough, melodramatic, egoistic humility. \u201cI want you to let Paul beat it off to Maine with me,\u201d Babbitt demanded. \u201cHow can I help his going? You've just said I was an idiot and nobody paid any attention to me.\u201d \u201cOh, you can help it, all right, all right! What you got to do is to cut out hinting that the minute he gets out of your sight, he'll go chasing after some petticoat.", " Let me do SOMETHING!\u201d \u201cI'm sorry, Babbitt, but the best thing you can do--I hate to say it, but you could help us most by keeping strictly out of it.\u201d Babbitt, revolving his hat like a defaulting poor tenant, winced so visibly that Maxwell condescended: \u201cI don't like to hurt your feelings, but you see we both want to do our best for Riesling, and we mustn't consider any other factor. The trouble with you, Babbitt, is that you're one of these fellows who talk too readily. You like to hear your own voice. If there were anything for which I could put you in the witness-box, you'd get going and give the whole show away. Sorry. Now I must look over some papers--So sorry.\u201d II He spent most of the next morning nerving himself to face the garrulous world of the Athletic Club. They would talk about Paul; they would be lip-licking and rotten. But at the Roughnecks' Table they did not mention Paul."], "Riesling receives a sentence of ___.": [" Dr. John Jennison Drew, M.A., pastor of the beautiful Chatham Road Presbyterian Church in lovely Floral Heights, is a wizard soul-winner. He holds the local record for conversions. During his shepherdhood an average of almost a hundred sin-weary persons per year have declared their resolve to lead a new life and have found a harbor of refuge and peace. Everything zips at the Chatham Road Church. The subsidiary organizations are keyed to the top-notch of efficiency. Dr. Drew is especially keen on good congregational singing. Bright cheerful hymns are used at every meeting, and the special Sing Services attract lovers of music and professionals from all parts of the city. On the popular lecture platform as well as in the pulpit Dr. Drew is a renowned word-painter, and during the course of the year he receives literally scores of invitations to speak at varied functions both here and elsewhere.", " For a week he went about looking important. Every morning, as he dressed, he thought aloud: \u201cJever stop to consider, Myra, that before a town can have buildings or prosperity or any of those things, some realtor has got to sell 'em the land? All civilization starts with him. Jever realize that?\u201d At the Athletic Club he led unwilling men aside to inquire, \u201cSay, if you had to read a paper before a big convention, would you start in with the funny stories or just kind of scatter 'em all through?\u201d He asked Howard Littlefield for a \u201cset of statistics about real-estate sales; something good and impressive,\u201d and Littlefield provided something exceedingly good and impressive. But it was to T. Cholmondeley Frink that Babbitt most often turned. He caught Frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while Frink looked hunted and evasive, \u201cSay, Chum--you're a shark on this writing stuff--how would you put this sentence, see here in my manuscript--manuscript now where the deuce is that?--oh, yes, here.", " Paul Riesling was coming in. Babbitt cried, \u201cSee you later, boys,\u201d and hastened across the lobby. He was, just then, neither the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the Lyte-Purdy conference, nor the blaring Good Fellow, the Josher and Regular Guy, of the Athletic Club. He was an older brother to Paul Riesling, swift to defend him, admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women. Paul and he shook hands solemnly; they smiled as shyly as though they had been parted three years, not three days--and they said: \u201cHow's the old horse-thief?\u201d \u201cAll right, I guess. How're you, you poor shrimp?\u201d \u201cI'm first-rate, you second-hand hunk o' cheese.\u201d Reassured thus of their high fondness, Babbitt grunted, \u201cYou're a fine guy, you are! Ten minutes late!\u201d Riesling snapped, \u201cWell, you're lucky to have a chance to lunch with a gentleman!\u201d They grinned and went into the Neronian washroom, where a line of men bent over the bowls inset along a prodigious slab of marble as in religious prostration before their own images in the massy mirror.", " But the crusading passion of it made him so tobacco-hungry that he immediately recovered the key, walked with forbidding dignity to the file, took out a cigar and a match--\u201cbut only one match; if ole cigar goes out, it'll by golly have to stay out!\u201d Later, when the cigar did go out, he took one more match from the file, and when a buyer and a seller came in for a conference at eleven-thirty, naturally he had to offer them cigars. His conscience protested, \u201cWhy, you're smoking with them!\u201d but he bullied it, \u201cOh, shut up! I'm busy now. Of course by-and-by--\u201d There was no by-and-by, yet his belief that he had crushed the unclean habit made him feel noble and very happy. When he called up Paul Riesling he was, in his moral splendor, unusually eager. He was fonder of Paul Riesling than of any one on earth except himself and his daughter Tinka. They had been classmates, roommates, in the State University, but always he thought of Paul Riesling, with his dark slimness, his precisely parted hair, his nose-glasses, his hesitant speech, his moodiness, his love of music, as a younger brother, to be petted and protected."], "What is Ida Putiak\u2019s profession?": [" Why, he wondered, should he be in rebellion? What was it all about? \u201cWhy not be sensible; stop all this idiotic running around, and enjoy himself with his family, his business, the fellows at the club?\u201d What was he getting out of rebellion? Misery and shame--the shame of being treated as an offensive small boy by a ragamuffin like Ida Putiak! And yet--Always he came back to \u201cAnd yet.\u201d Whatever the misery, he could not regain contentment with a world which, once doubted, became absurd. Only, he assured himself, he was \u201cthrough with this chasing after girls.\u201d By noontime he was not so sure even of that. If in Miss McGoun, Louetta Swanson, and Ida he had failed to find the lady kind and lovely, it did not prove that she did not exist. He was hunted by the ancient thought that somewhere must exist the not impossible she who would understand him, value him, and make him happy. II Mrs. Babbitt returned in August.", " He reflected that from the standpoint of the Rev. Dr. John Jennison Drew he was a wicked man, and from the standpoint of Miss Ida Putiak, an old bore who had to be endured as the penalty attached to eating a large dinner. \u201cDearie, you aren't going to go and get peevish, are you?\u201d She spoke pertly. He wanted to spank her. He brooded, \u201cI don't have to take anything off this gutter-pup! Darn immigrant! Well, let's get it over as quick as we can, and sneak home and kick ourselves for the rest of the night.\u201d He snorted, \u201cHuh? Me peevish? Why, you baby, why should I be peevish? Now, listen, Ida; listen to Uncle George. I want to put you wise about this scrapping with your head-barber all the time. I've had a lot of experience with employees, and let me tell you it doesn't pay to antagonize--\u201d At the drab wooden house in which she lived he said good-night briefly and amiably, but as the taxicab drove off he was praying \u201cOh, my God!\u201d CHAPTER XXV I HE awoke to stretch cheerfully as he listened to the sparrows, then to remember that everything was wrong; that he was determined to go astray, and not in the least enjoying the process.", " They give away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman.\u201d Remembering Ida Putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him, Babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had used him, he told of Paul Riesling, of Zilla, of Seneca Doane, of the strike: \u201cSee how it was? Course I was as anxious to have those beggars licked to a standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their side. For a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal, don't you think so?\u201d \u201cOh, I do!\u201d Sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her hands beside her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of being appreciated he proclaimed: \u201cSo I up and said to the fellows at the club, 'Look here,' I--\u201d \u201cDo you belong to the Union Club? I think it's--\u201d \u201cNo; the Athletic. Tell you: Course they're always asking me to join the Union, but I always say, 'No, sir!", " I won't! I won't go back! I'll be fifty in three years. Sixty in thirteen years. I'm going to have some fun before it's too late. I don't care! I will!\u201d He thought of Ida Putiak, of Louetta Swanson, of that nice widow--what was her name?--Tanis Judique?--the one for whom he'd found the flat. He was enmeshed in imaginary conversations. Then: \u201cGee, I can't seem to get away from thinking about folks!\u201d Thus it came to him merely to run away was folly, because he could never run away from himself. That moment he started for Zenith. In his journey there was no appearance of flight, but he was fleeing, and four days afterward he was on the Zenith train. He knew that he was slinking back not because it was what he longed to do but because it was all he could do. He scanned again his discovery that he could never run away from Zenith and family and office, because in his own brain he bore the office and the family and every street and disquiet and illusion of Zenith."], "As violence erupts in Zenith, which force is called in?": [" \u201cHow's it going, Captain?\u201d inquired Vergil Gunch. \u201cOh, we got 'em stopped. We worked 'em off on side streets and separated 'em and they got discouraged and went home.\u201d \u201cFine work. No violence.\u201d \u201cFine work nothing!\u201d groaned Mr. Drum. \u201cIf I had my way, there'd be a whole lot of violence, and I'd start it, and then the whole thing would be over. I don't believe in standing back and wet-nursing these fellows and letting the disturbances drag on. I tell you these strikers are nothing in God's world but a lot of bomb-throwing socialists and thugs, and the only way to handle 'em is with a club! That's what I'd do; beat up the whole lot of 'em!\u201d Babbitt heard himself saying, \u201cOh, rats, Clarence, they look just about like you and me, and I certainly didn't notice any bombs.\u201d Drum complained, \u201cOh, you didn't, eh? Well, maybe you'd like to take charge of the strike! Just tell Colonel Nixon what innocents the strikers are!", " Updike was Zenith's professional bachelor; a slim-waisted man of forty-six with an effeminate voice and taste in flowers, cretonnes, and flappers. Mrs. McKelvey was red-haired, creamy, discontented, exquisite, rude, and honest. Updike tried his invariable first maneuver--touching her nervous wrist. \u201cDon't be an idiot!\u201d she said. \u201cDo you mind awfully?\u201d \u201cNo! That's what I mind!\u201d He changed to conversation. He was famous at conversation. He spoke reasonably of psychoanalysis, Long Island polo, and the Ming platter he had found in Vancouver. She promised to meet him in Deauville, the coming summer, \u201cthough,\u201d she sighed, \u201cit's becoming too dreadfully banal; nothing but Americans and frowsy English baronesses.\u201d And at that moment in Zenith, a cocaine-runner and a prostitute were drinking cocktails in Healey Hanson's saloon on Front Street. Since national prohibition was now in force, and since Zenith was notoriously law-abiding, they were compelled to keep the cocktails innocent by drinking them out of tea-cups.", " Babbitt drove on slowly, oppressed by futility. He had a sudden, unexplained, and horrible conviction that the McKelveys were laughing at him. He betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his wife, \u201cFolks that really tend to business haven't got the time to waste on a bunch like the McKelveys. This society stuff is like any other hobby; if you devote yourself to it, you get on. But I like to have a chance to visit with you and the children instead of all this idiotic chasing round.\u201d They did not speak of the McKelveys again. V It was a shame, at this worried time, to have to think about the Overbrooks. Ed Overbrook was a classmate of Babbitt who had been a failure. He had a large family and a feeble insurance business out in the suburb of Dorchester. He was gray and thin and unimportant. He had always been gray and thin and unimportant. He was the person whom, in any group, you forgot to introduce, then introduced with extra enthusiasm.", " There's nothing left. I don't ever want to see her. Some day I'm going to break away from her. Somehow.\u201d CHAPTER XXI THE International Organization of Boosters' Clubs has become a world-force for optimism, manly pleasantry, and good business. Chapters are to be found now in thirty countries. Nine hundred and twenty of the thousand chapters, however, are in the United States. None of these is more ardent than the Zenith Boosters' Club. The second March lunch of the Zenith Boosters was the most important of the year, as it was to be followed by the annual election of officers. There was agitation abroad. The lunch was held in the ballroom of the O'Hearn House. As each of the four hundred Boosters entered he took from a wall-board a huge celluloid button announcing his name, his nick name, and his business. There was a fine of ten cents for calling a Fellow Booster by anything but his nickname at a lunch, and as Babbitt jovially checked his hat the air was radiant with shouts of \u201cHello, Chet!\u201d and \u201cHow're you, Shorty!\u201d and \u201cTop o' the mornin', Mac!\u201d They sat at friendly tables for eight, choosing places by lot."], "What does Babbitt call Reverend Drew\u2019s sermon?": [" I want to tend to business. Think I'll just kind of slacken up on this G.C.L. stuff now.\u201d He had returned to the church as he had returned to the Boosters' Club. He had even endured the lavish greeting which Sheldon Smeeth gave him. He was worried lest during his late discontent he had imperiled his salvation. He was not quite sure there was a Heaven to be attained, but Dr. John Jennison Drew said there was, and Babbitt was not going to take a chance. One evening when he was walking past Dr. Drew's parsonage he impulsively went in and found the pastor in his study. \u201cJus' minute--getting 'phone call,\u201d said Dr. Drew in businesslike tones, then, aggressively, to the telephone: \u201c'Lo--'lo! This Berkey and Hannis? Reverend Drew speaking. Where the dickens is the proof for next Sunday's calendar? Huh? Y' ought to have it here. Well, I can't help it if they're ALL sick!

Took a few drinks and so on. What I wanted to ask is: How is it if a fellow cuts that all out and comes back to his senses? Does it sort of, well, you might say, does it score against him in the long run?\u201d The Reverend Dr. Drew was suddenly interested. \u201cAnd, uh, brother--the other things, too? Women?\u201d \u201cNo, practically, you might say, practically not at all.\u201d \u201cDon't hesitate to tell me, brother! That's what I'm here for. Been going on joy-rides? Squeezing girls in cars?\u201d The reverend eyes glistened. \u201cNo--no--\u201d \u201cWell, I'll tell you. I've got a deputation from the Don't Make Prohibition a Joke Association coming to see me in a quarter of an hour, and one from the Anti-Birth-Control Union at a quarter of ten.\u201d He busily glanced at his watch.", " IV When the Sunday School campaign was finished, Babbitt suggested to Kenneth Escott, \u201cSay, how about doing a little boosting for Doc Drew personally?\u201d Escott grinned. \u201cYou trust the doc to do a little boosting for himself, Mr. Babbitt! There's hardly a week goes by without his ringing up the paper to say if we'll chase a reporter up to his Study, he'll let us in on the story about the swell sermon he's going to preach on the wickedness of short skirts, or the authorship of the Pentateuch. Don't you worry about him. There's just one better publicity-grabber in town, and that's this Dora Gibson Tucker that runs the Child Welfare and the Americanization League, and the only reason she's got Drew beaten is because she has got SOME brains!\u201d \u201cWell, now Kenneth, I don't think you ought to talk that way about the doctor. A preacher has to watch his interests, hasn't he? You remember that in the Bible about--about being diligent in the Lord's business, or something?\u201d \u201cAll right, I'll get something in if you want me to, Mr. Babbitt, but I'll have to wait till the managing editor is out of town, and then blackjack the city editor.\u201d Thus it came to pass that in the Sunday Advocate-Times, under a picture of Dr. Drew at his earnestest, with eyes alert, jaw as granite, and rustic lock flamboyant, appeared an inscription--a wood-pulp tablet conferring twenty-four hours' immortality: The Rev.", " On a December morning when the Babbitts went to church, Dr. John Jennison Drew was unusually eloquent. The crowd was immense. Ten brisk young ushers, in morning coats with white roses, were bringing folding chairs up from the basement. There was an impressive musical program, conducted by Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A., who also sang the offertory. Babbitt cared less for this, because some misguided person had taught young Mr. Smeeth to smile, smile, smile while he was singing, but with all the appreciation of a fellow-orator he admired Dr. Drew's sermon. It had the intellectual quality which distinguished the Chatham Road congregation from the grubby chapels on Smith Street. \u201cAt this abundant harvest-time of all the year,\u201d Dr. Drew chanted, \u201cwhen, though stormy the sky and laborious the path to the drudging wayfarer, yet the hovering and bodiless spirit swoops back o'er all the labors and desires of the past twelve months, oh, then it seems to me there sounds behind all our apparent failures the golden chorus of greeting from those passed happily on; and lo!"], "How do Babbitt\u2019s friends behave towards him after his outburst?": [" He had controverted the report by growling, \u201cFolks that think a jail ought to be a bloomin' Hotel Thornleigh make me sick. If people don't like a jail, let 'em behave 'emselves and keep out of it. Besides, these reform cranks always exaggerate.\u201d That was the beginning and quite completely the end of his investigations into Zenith's charities and corrections; and as to the \u201cvice districts\u201d he brightly expressed it, \u201cThose are things that no decent man monkeys with. Besides, smatter fact, I'll tell you confidentially: it's a protection to our daughters and to decent women to have a district where tough nuts can raise cain. Keeps 'em away from our own homes.\u201d As to industrial conditions, however, Babbitt had thought a great deal, and his opinions may be coordinated as follows: \u201cA good labor union is of value because it keeps out radical unions, which would destroy property. No one ought to be forced to belong to a union, however.", " Slewing round a corner came a less cautious car. It skidded, it almost raked them with its rear fenders. In relief at their escape the Bunch--Tanis, Minnie Sonntag, Pete, Fulton Bemis--shouted \u201cOh, baby,\u201d and waved their hands to the agitated other driver. Then Babbitt saw Professor Pumphrey laboriously crawling up hill, afoot, Staring owlishly at the revelers. He was sure that Pumphrey recognized him and saw Tanis kiss him as she crowed, \u201cYou're such a good driver!\u201d At lunch next day he probed Pumphrey with \u201cOut last night with my brother and some friends of his. Gosh, what driving! Slippery 's glass. Thought I saw you hiking up the Bellevue Avenue Hill.\u201d \u201cNo, I wasn't--I didn't see you,\u201d said Pumphrey, hastily, rather guiltily. Perhaps two days afterward Babbitt took Tanis to lunch at the Hotel Thornleigh. She who had seemed well content to wait for him at her flat had begun to hint with melancholy smiles that he must think but little of her if he never introduced her to his friends, if he was unwilling to be seen with her except at the movies.", " They went out to rifle the ice-box. Babbitt gloated, \u201cIf your mother caught us at this, we'd certainly get our come-uppance!\u201d and Eunice became maternal, scrambled a terrifying number of eggs for them, kissed Babbitt on the ear, and in the voice of a brooding abbess marveled, \u201cIt beats the devil why feminists like me still go on nursing these men!\u201d Thus stimulated, Babbitt was reckless when he encountered Sheldon Smeeth, educational director of the Y.M.C.A. and choir-leader of the Chatham Road Church. With one of his damp hands Smeeth imprisoned Babbitt's thick paw while he chanted, \u201cBrother Babbitt, we haven't seen you at church very often lately. I know you're busy with a multitude of details, but you mustn't forget your dear friends at the old church home.\u201d Babbitt shook off the affectionate clasp--Sheldy liked to hold hands for a long time--and snarled, \u201cWell, I guess you fellows can run the show without me.", " Well, when you see me giving you--\u201d Somewhat later, after diplomacies, Ted persuaded Verona to admit that she was merely going to the Armory, that evening, to see the dog and cat show. She was then, Ted planned, to park the car in front of the candy-store across from the Armory and he would pick it up. There were masterly arrangements regarding leaving the key, and having the gasoline tank filled; and passionately, devotees of the Great God Motor, they hymned the patch on the spare inner-tube, and the lost jack-handle. Their truce dissolving, Ted observed that her friends were \u201ca scream of a bunch-stuck-up gabby four-flushers.\u201d His friends, she indicated, were \u201cdisgusting imitation sports, and horrid little shrieking ignorant girls.\u201d Further: \u201cIt's disgusting of you to smoke cigarettes, and so on and so forth, and those clothes you've got on this morning, they're too utterly ridiculous--honestly, simply disgusting.\u201d Ted balanced over to the low beveled mirror in the buffet, regarded his charms, and smirked."], "Who falls ill, causing Myra to leave Zenith for a few weeks?": [" \u201cHow much we takin' to-day?\u201d asked Moon, in a manner which combined the independence of the great specialist, the friendliness of a familiar gossip, and respect for a man of weight in the community, like George F.

I think perhaps I ought to go stay with her for a few weeks.\u201d Now, Mrs. Babbitt was not accustomed to leave home during the winter except on violently demanding occasions, and only the summer before, she had been gone for weeks. Nor was Babbitt one of the detachable husbands who take separations casually.

A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester. It was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at six-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven.

Vergil Gunch intimidatingly said nothing. He put on sternness like a mask; his jaw was hard, his bristly short hair seemed cruel, his silence was a ferocious thunder.

He spoke slowly then, and gravely: \u201cBoys, I have something shocking to reveal to you; something terrible about one of our own members.\u201d Several Boosters, including Babbitt, looked disconcerted. \u201cA knight of the grip, a trusted friend of mine, recently made a trip up-state, and in a certain town, where a certain Booster spent his boyhood, he found out something which can no longer be concealed. In fact, he discovered the inward nature of a man whom we have accepted as a Real Guy and as one of us. Gentlemen, I cannot trust my voice to say it, so I have written it down.\u201d He uncovered a large blackboard and on it, in huge capitals, was the legend: George Follansbee Babbitt--oh you Folly!", " On the way back Babbitt picked up his partner and father-in-law, Henry T. Thompson, at his kitchen-cabinet works, and they drove through South Zenith, a high-colored, banging, exciting region: new factories of hollow tile with gigantic wire-glass windows, surly old red-brick factories stained with tar, high-perched water-tanks, big red trucks like locomotives, and, on a score of hectic side-tracks, far-wandering freight-cars from the New York Central and apple orchards, the Great Northern and wheat-plateaus, the Southern Pacific and orange groves. They talked to the secretary of the Zenith Foundry Company about an interesting artistic project--a cast-iron fence for Linden Lane Cemetery. They drove on to the Zeeco Motor Company and interviewed the sales-manager, Noel Ryland, about a discount on a Zeeco car for Thompson. Babbitt and Ryland were fellow-members of the Boosters' Club, and no Booster felt right if he bought anything from another Booster without receiving a discount.", " Lucas Prout. Vergil Gunch thundered, \u201cWhen we manage to grab this celebrated Thespian off his lovely aggregation of beautiful actresses--and I got to admit I butted right into his dressing-room and told him how the Boosters appreciated the high-class artistic performance he's giving us--and don't forget that the treasurer of the Dodsworth is a Booster and will appreciate our patronage--and when on top of that we yank Hizzonor out of his multifarious duties at City Hall, then I feel we've done ourselves proud, and Mr. Prout will now say a few words about the problems and duties--\u201d By rising vote the Boosters decided which was the handsomest and which the ugliest guest, and to each of them was given a bunch of carnations, donated, President Gunch noted, by Brother Booster H. G. Yeager, the Jennifer Avenue florist. Each week, in rotation, four Boosters were privileged to obtain the pleasures of generosity and of publicity by donating goods or services to four fellow-members, chosen by lot.", " He's been out there all morning getting hot and dusty, and no wonder he wants to beat the tar out of those sons of guns!\u201d Gunch said nothing, and watched; and Babbitt knew that he was being watched. III As he was leaving the club Babbitt heard Chum Frink protesting to Gunch, \u201c--don't know what's got into him. Last Sunday Doc Drew preached a corking sermon about decency in business and Babbitt kicked about that, too. Near 's I can figure out--\u201d Babbitt was vaguely frightened. IV He saw a crowd listening to a man who was talking from the rostrum of a kitchen-chair. He stopped his car. From newspaper pictures he knew that the speaker must be the notorious freelance preacher, Beecher Ingram, of whom Seneca Doane had spoken. Ingram was a gaunt man with flamboyant hair, weather-beaten cheeks, and worried eyes. He was pleading: \u201c--if those telephone girls can hold out, living on one meal a day, doing their own washing, starving and smiling, you big hulking men ought to be able--\u201d Babbitt saw that from the sidewalk Vergil Gunch was watching him."], "What do Charles McKelvey, Dr. Dilling, and Colonel Rutherford Snow demand Babbitt join?": [" Babbitt was aware that Dr. A. I. Dilling was sternly listening from across the table. Dr. Dilling was one of the most important men in the Boosters'. He was not a physician but a surgeon, a more romantic and sounding occupation. He was an intense large man with a boiling of black hair and a thick black mustache. The newspapers often chronicled his operations; he was professor of surgery in the State University; he went to dinner at the very best houses on Royal Ridge; and he was said to be worth several hundred thousand dollars. It was dismaying to Babbitt to have such a person glower at him. He hastily praised the congressman's wit, to Sidney Finkelstein, but for Dr. Dilling's benefit. III That afternoon three men shouldered into Babbitt's office with the air of a Vigilante committee in frontier days. They were large, resolute, big-jawed men, and they were all high lords in the land of Zenith--Dr. Dilling the surgeon, Charles McKelvey the contractor, and, most dismaying of all, the white-bearded Colonel Rutherford Snow, owner of the Advocate-Times.", " Dr. Patten was profusely casual: \u201cDon't want to worry you, old man, but I thought it might be a good stunt to have Dr. Dilling examine her.\u201d He gestured toward Dilling as toward a master. Dilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode up-stairs Babbitt tramped the living-room in agony. Except for his wife's confinements there had never been a major operation in the family, and to him surgery was at once a miracle and an abomination of fear. But when Dilling and Patten came down again he knew that everything was all right, and he wanted to laugh, for the two doctors were exactly like the bearded physicians in a musical comedy, both of them rubbing their hands and looking foolishly sagacious. Dr. Dilling spoke: \u201cI'm sorry, old man, but it's acute appendicitis. We ought to operate. Of course you must decide, but there's no question as to what has to be done.\u201d Babbitt did not get all the force of it.", " In their whelming presence Babbitt felt small and insignificant. \u201cWell, well, great pleasure, have chairs, what c'n I do for you?\u201d he babbled. They neither sat nor offered observations on the weather. \u201cBabbitt,\u201d said Colonel Snow, \u201cwe've come from the Good Citizens' League. We've decided we want you to join. Vergil Gunch says you don't care to, but I think we can show you a new light. The League is going to combine with the Chamber of Commerce in a campaign for the Open Shop, so it's time for you to put your name down.\u201d In his embarrassment Babbitt could not recall his reasons for not wishing to join the League, if indeed he had ever definitely known them, but he was passionately certain that he did not wish to join, and at the thought of their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even these princes of commerce. \u201cSorry, Colonel, have to think it over a little,\u201d he mumbled. McKelvey snarled, \u201cThat means you're not going to join, George?\u201d Something black and unfamiliar and ferocious spoke from Babbitt: \u201cNow, you look here, Charley!", " The League was more than generous in approving other organizations which agreed with its aims. It helped the Y.M. C.A. to raise a two-hundred-thousand-dollar fund for a new building. Babbitt, Vergil Gunch, Sidney Finkelstein, and even Charles McKelvey told the spectators at movie theaters how great an influence for manly Christianity the \u201cgood old Y.\u201d had been in their own lives; and the hoar and mighty Colonel Rutherford Snow, owner of the Advocate-Times, was photographed clasping the hand of Sheldon Smeeth of the Y.M.C.A. It is true that afterward, when Smeeth lisped, \u201cYou must come to one of our prayer-meetings,\u201d the ferocious Colonel bellowed, \u201cWhat the hell would I do that for? I've got a bar of my own,\u201d but this did not appear in the public prints. The League was of value to the American Legion at a time when certain of the lesser and looser newspapers were criticizing that organization of veterans of the Great War."], "Which characters offer Babbitt support in his struggle against conformity?": [" II Baseball, he determined, would be an excellent hobby. \u201cNo sense a man's working his fool head off. I'm going out to the Game three times a week. Besides, fellow ought to support the home team.\u201d He did go and support the team, and enhance the glory of Zenith, by yelling \u201cAttaboy!\u201d and \u201cRotten!\u201d He performed the rite scrupulously. He wore a cotton handkerchief about his collar; he became sweaty; he opened his mouth in a wide loose grin; and drank lemon soda out of a bottle. He went to the Game three times a week, for one week. Then he compromised on watching the Advocate-Times bulletin-board. He stood in the thickest and steamiest of the crowd, and as the boy up on the lofty platform recorded the achievements of Big Bill Bostwick, the pitcher, Babbitt remarked to complete strangers, \u201cPretty nice! Good work!\u201d and hastened back to the office. He honestly believed that he loved baseball. It is true that he hadn't, in twenty-five years, himself played any baseball except back-lot catch with Ted--very gentle, and strictly limited to ten minutes.", " All of them agreed that the working-classes must be kept in their place; and all of them perceived that American Democracy did not imply any equality of wealth, but did demand a wholesome sameness of thought, dress, painting, morals, and vocabulary. In this they were like the ruling-class of any other country, particularly of Great Britain, but they differed in being more vigorous and in actually trying to produce the accepted standards which all classes, everywhere, desire, but usually despair of realizing. The longest struggle of the Good Citizens' League was against the Open Shop--which was secretly a struggle against all union labor. Accompanying it was an Americanization Movement, with evening classes in English and history and economics, and daily articles in the newspapers, so that newly arrived foreigners might learn that the true-blue and one hundred per cent. American way of settling labor-troubles was for workmen to trust and love their employers.", " But just as often, when he heard the soft whispers enveloping him he wailed, \u201cGood Lord, what have I done? Just played with the Bunch, and called down Clarence Drum about being such a high-and-mighty sodger. Never catch ME criticizing people and trying to make them accept MY ideas!\u201d He could not stand the strain. Before long he admitted that he would like to flee back to the security of conformity, provided there was a decent and creditable way to return. But, stubbornly, he would not be forced back; he would not, he swore, \u201ceat dirt.\u201d Only in spirited engagements with his wife did these turbulent fears rise to the surface. She complained that he seemed nervous, that she couldn't understand why he did not want to \u201cdrop in at the Littlefields'\u201d for the evening. He tried, but he could not express to her the nebulous facts of his rebellion and punishment. And, with Paul and Tanis lost, he had no one to whom he could talk.", " I apologize, boys. In my next what-d'you-call-it I'll see to it that I get named something really practical--something that sounds swell and yet is good and virile--something, in fact, like that grand old name so familiar to every household--that bold and almost overpowering name, Willis Jimjams Ijams!\u201d He knew by the cheer that he was secure again and popular; he knew that he would no more endanger his security and popularity by straying from the Clan of Good Fellows. V Henry Thompson dashed into the office, clamoring, \u201cGeorge! Big news! Jake Offutt says the Traction Bunch are dissatisfied with the way Sanders, Torrey and Wing handled their last deal, and they're willing to dicker with us!\u201d Babbitt was pleased in the realization that the last scar of his rebellion was healed, yet as he drove home he was annoyed by such background thoughts as had never weakened him in his days of belligerent conformity."], "How long is Myra in the hospital recovering from appendicitis?": [" By golly, I'm going to go and order a hundred gallons of it, right from Vermont!\u201d II She was out of the hospital in seventeen days. He went to see her each afternoon, and in their long talks they drifted back to intimacy. Once he hinted something of his relations to Tanis and the Bunch, and she was inflated by the view that a Wicked Woman had captivated her poor George. If once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the Good Fellows, he was convinced now. You didn't, he noted, \u201csee Seneca Doane coming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the Missus,\u201d but Mrs. Howard Littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine jelly (flavored with real wine); Orville Jones spent hours in picking out the kind of novels Mrs. Babbitt liked--nice love stories about New York millionaries and Wyoming cowpunchers; Louetta Swanson knitted a pink bed-jacket; Sidney Finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of a wife selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of Parcher and Stein.", " Jesus!\u201d \u201cWhy, George Babbitt, I won't have you cursing and swearing and blaspheming!\u201d \u201cI know, awful sorry but--Gosh all fish-hooks, look how I burned my hand! Gee whiz, it hurts! It hurts like the mischief! Why, that damn radiator is hot as--it's hot as--it's hotter 'n the hinges of Hades! Look! You can see the mark!\u201d So, as they drove up to St. Mary's Hospital, with the nurses already laying out the instruments for an operation to save her life, it was she who consoled him and kissed the place to make it well, and though he tried to be gruff and mature, he yielded to her and was glad to be babied. The ambulance whirled under the hooded carriage-entrance of the hospital, and instantly he was reduced to a zero in the nightmare succession of cork-floored halls, endless doors open on old women sitting up in bed, an elevator, the anesthetizing room, a young interne contemptuous of husbands.", " Just take a few minutes--not half as serious as a confinement--and you'll be all right in a jiffy.\u201d She gripped his hand till the fingers ached. She said patiently, like a cowed child, \u201cI'm afraid--to go into the dark, all alone!\u201d Maturity was wiped from her eyes; they were pleading and terrified. \u201cWill you stay with me? Darling, you don't have to go to the office now, do you? Could you just go down to the hospital with me? Could you come see me this evening--if everything's all right? You won't have to go out this evening, will you?\u201d He was on his knees by the bed. While she feebly ruffled his hair, he sobbed, he kissed the lawn of her sleeve, and swore, \u201cOld honey, I love you more than anything in the world! I've kind of been worried by business and everything, but that's all over now, and I'm back again.\u201d \u201cAre you really? George, I was thinking, lying here, maybe it would be a good thing if I just WENT.", " Dr. Patten was profusely casual: \u201cDon't want to worry you, old man, but I thought it might be a good stunt to have Dr. Dilling examine her.\u201d He gestured toward Dilling as toward a master. Dilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode up-stairs Babbitt tramped the living-room in agony.

He wants to go to college, and he doesn't want to go to college. Only one of the three that knows her own mind is Tinka. Simply can't understand how I ever came to have a pair of shillyshallying children like Rone and Ted. I may not be any Rockefeller or James J. Shakespeare, but I certainly do know my own mind, and I do keep right on plugging along in the office and--Do you know the latest? Far as I can figure out, Ted's new bee is he'd like to be a movie actor and--And here I've told him a hundred times, if he'll go to college and law-school and make good, I'll set him up in business and--Verona just exactly as bad. Doesn't know what she wants. Well, well, come on! Aren't you ready yet? The girl rang the bell three minutes ago.\u201d V Before he followed his wife, Babbitt stood at the westernmost window of their room. This residential settlement, Floral Heights, was on a rise; and though the center of the city was three miles away--Zenith had between three and four hundred thousand inhabitants now--he could see the top of the Second National Tower, an Indiana limestone building of thirty-five stories.", " Suppose Lucile McKelvey heard you calling it a 'Tux. '\u201d \u201cWell, that's all right now! Lucile McKelvey can't pull anything on me! Her folks are common as mud, even if her husband and her dad are millionaires! I suppose you're trying to rub in your exalted social position! Well, let me tell you that your revered paternal ancestor, Henry T., doesn't even call it a 'Tux.'! He calls it a 'bobtail jacket for a ringtail monkey,' and you couldn't get him into one unless you chloroformed him!\u201d \u201cNow don't be horrid, George.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't want to be horrid, but Lord! you're getting as fussy as Verona. Ever since she got out of college she's been too rambunctious to live with--doesn't know what she wants--well, I know what she wants!--all she wants is to marry a millionaire, and live in Europe, and hold some preacher's hand, and simultaneously at the same time stay right here in Zenith and be some blooming kind of a socialist agitator or boss charity-worker or some damn thing!", " I mean--it's so lacking in refinement, but--And Mother wants to come and stay with me for a whole month, and of course I do love her, I suppose I do, but honestly, she'll cramp my style something dreadful--she never can learn not to comment, and she always wants to know where I'm going when I go out evenings, and if I lie to her she always spies around and ferrets around and finds out where I've been, and then she looks like Patience on a Monument till I could just scream. And oh, I MUST tell you--You know I never talk about myself; I just hate people who do, don't you? But--I feel so stupid to-night, and I know I must be boring you with all this but--What would you do about Mother?\u201d He gave her facile masculine advice. She was to put off her mother's stay. She was to tell Carrie to go to the deuce. For these valuable revelations she thanked him, and they ambled into the familiar gossip of the Bunch.", " Can't get your fist onto 'em. Half cold, anyway!\u201d Ted Babbitt, junior in the great East Side High School, had been making hiccup-like sounds of interruption. He blurted now, \u201cSay, Rone, you going to--\u201d Verona whirled. \u201cTed! Will you kindly not interrupt us when we're talking about serious matters!\u201d \u201cAw punk,\u201d said Ted judicially. \u201cEver since somebody slipped up and let you out of college, Ammonia, you been pulling these nut conversations about what-nots and so-on-and-so-forths.
