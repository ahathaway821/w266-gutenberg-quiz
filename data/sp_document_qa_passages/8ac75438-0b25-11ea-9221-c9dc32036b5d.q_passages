Long liue the King *** As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words or letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u, above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . . The answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a time when they were out of \"v\"'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in place of some \"w\"'s, etc. This was a common practice of the day, as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend more on a wider selection of characters than they had to. You will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I have mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a very high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.", " My father read an assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the purpose. To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available . . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes, that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous for signing his name with several different spellings.

Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold your selfe Bar. Long liue the King *** As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words or letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u, above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . . The answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a time when they were out of \"v\"'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in place of some \"w\"'s, etc. This was a common practice of the day, as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend more on a wider selection of characters than they had to. You will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I have mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a very high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.", " Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong, But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.
