{"With a discussionof what topic does Anna Pavlovna Scherer open the novel?": [" How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. We women, Prince,\u201d and she smiled tenderly, \u201calways know how to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me. I am used to suffering.\u201d Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cWould not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna?\u201d said he. \u201cLet us wait until evening. The doctors are expecting a crisis.\u201d \u201cBut one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...\u201d A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the count\u2019s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vas\u00edli turned to her. \u201cWell, how is he?\u201d \u201cStill the same; but what can you expect, this noise...\u201d said the princess, looking at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna as at a stranger. \u201cAh, my dear, I hardly knew you,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count\u2019s niece. \u201cI have come, and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have gone through,\u201d and she sympathetically turned up her eyes. The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vas\u00edli to take a seat beside her.", " Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. \u201cIt seems to be all right,\u201d Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there. \u201cIs this the way to the princesses\u2019 apartments?\u201d asked Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna of one of them.", " If you want anything come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.\u201d Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter had left the room Kut\u00fazov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis. Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that interview with Kut\u00fazov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man\u2014in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions, and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events\u2014the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should. \u201cHe will not bring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake anything,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cbut he will hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will\u2014the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else. And above all,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cone believes in him because he\u2019s Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: \u2018What they have brought us to!\u2019 and had a sob in it when he said he would \u2018make them eat horseflesh!\u2019\u201d On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the popular choice of Kut\u00fazov as commander in chief was received.", " Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet steps. \u201cPierre!\u201d she said. Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said: \u201cHe is no more....\u201d Pierre looked at her over his spectacles. \u201cCome, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears.\u201d She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna left him, and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm. In the morning Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna said to Pierre: \u201cYes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.\u201d Pierre was silent. \u201cPerhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Bor\u00eds. But he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father\u2019s wish?\u201d Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna returned to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and went to bed."], "What is VasiliKuragin interested in obtaining for his son Anatole?": [" Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety. Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him. \u201cYou promised Countess Rost\u00f3va to marry her and were about to elope with her, is that so?\u201d \u201cMon cher,\u201d answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French), \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone.\u201d Pierre\u2019s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till Anatole\u2019s face showed a sufficient degree of terror. \u201cWhen I tell you that I must talk to you!...\u201d repeated Pierre. \u201cCome now, this is stupid. What?\u201d said Anatole, fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth. \u201cYou\u2019re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don\u2019t know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!\u201d said Pierre, expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French. He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put it back in its place. \u201cDid you promise to marry her?\u201d \u201cI... I didn\u2019t think of it. I never promised, because...\u201d Pierre interrupted him. \u201cHave you any letters of hers? Any letters?\u201d he said, moving toward Anatole. Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook.", " He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home. Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\u00f3lokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see Nat\u00e1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\u2019s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The countess\u2019 drawing room was full of guests. Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return\u2014at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever\u2014entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him. \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room. \u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.", " \u201cNow you, young prince, what\u2019s your name?\u201d said Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, turning to Anatole, \u201ccome here, let us talk and get acquainted.\u201d \u201cNow the fun begins,\u201d thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince. \u201cWell, my dear boy, I hear you\u2019ve been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?\u201d asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently. \u201cNo, I have been transferred to the line,\u201d said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter. \u201cAh! That\u2019s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?\u201d \u201cNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?\u201d said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh. \u201cA splendid soldier, splendid! \u2018What am I attached to!\u2019 Ha, ha, ha!\u201d laughed Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolk\u00f3nski frowned. \u201cYou may go,\u201d he said to Anatole. Anatole returned smiling to the ladies. \u201cAnd so you\u2019ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vas\u00edli, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said the old prince to Prince Vas\u00edli. \u201cI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours.\u201d \u201cYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad\u2019s a fine fellow, a fine fellow!", " D\u00f3lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an ironic smile: \u201cDo you know? You\u2019d really better drop it all. There\u2019s still time!\u201d \u201cFool,\u201d retorted Anatole. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! If you only knew... it\u2019s the devil knows what!\u201d \u201cNo, really, give it up!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI am speaking seriously. It\u2019s no joke, this plot you\u2019ve hatched.\u201d \u201cWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?\u201d said Anatole, making a grimace. \u201cReally it\u2019s no time for your stupid jokes,\u201d and he left the room. D\u00f3lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out. \u201cYou wait a bit,\u201d he called after him. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, I\u2019m talking sense. Come here, come here!\u201d Anatole returned and looked at D\u00f3lokhov, trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily. \u201cNow listen to me. I\u2019m telling you this for the last time. Why should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I did it all.\u201d \u201cWell, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?\u201d And Anatole sighed and embraced D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a dangerous business, and if you think about it\u2014a stupid business. Well, you\u2019ll carry her off\u2014all right! Will they let it stop at that? It will come out that you\u2019re already married. Why, they\u2019ll have you in the criminal court....\u201d \u201cOh, nonsense, nonsense!\u201d Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace."], "In what centuryis War and Peace set?": [" \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored. \u201cBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country\u2019s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone.", " I remember, yes, I remember you with the standard!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, and a flush of pleasure suffused Prince Andrew\u2019s face at this recollection. Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kut\u00fazov offered his cheek to be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man\u2019s eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kut\u00fazov\u2019s tears came easily, and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him. \u201cGo your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of honor!\u201d He paused. \u201cI missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to send.\u201d And changing the subject, Kut\u00fazov began to speak of the Turkish war and the peace that had been concluded. \u201cYes, I have been much blamed,\u201d he said, \u201cboth for that war and the peace... but everything came at the right time. Tout vient \u00e0 point \u00e0 celui qui sait attendre. * And there were as many advisers there as here...\u201d he went on, returning to the subject of \u201cadvisers\u201d which evidently occupied him. \u201cAh, those advisers!\u201d said he. \u201cIf we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. K\u00e1menski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign.", " It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten thousand, that\u2019s war! But the enemy has lost masses.... What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow.... There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You would set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform. If it has come to this\u2014we must fight as long as Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand.... One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the Minister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all.", " You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?\u201d he continued hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and Alexander\u2019s errors and duplicity. The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking, and the more he talked the less could he control his words. The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and insult Alexander\u2014just what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview. \u201cI hear you have made peace with Turkey?\u201d Balash\u00ebv bowed his head affirmatively. \u201cPeace has been concluded...\u201d he began. But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone. \u201cYes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those provinces as I gave him Finland."], "What is Pierre\u2019smost noticeable physical feature?": [" \u201cI build a house and lay out a garden, and you build hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But what\u2019s right and what\u2019s good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by us. Well, you want an argument,\u201d he added, \u201ccome on then.\u201d They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda. \u201cCome, let\u2019s argue then,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cYou talk of schools,\u201d he went on, crooking a finger, \u201ceducation and so forth; that is, you want to raise him\u201d (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap) \u201cfrom his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of. I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my means. Then you say, \u2018lighten his toil.\u2019 But as I see it, physical labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as mental activity is to you or me. You can\u2019t help thinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I can\u2019t sleep but toss about till dawn, because I think and can\u2019t help thinking, just as he can\u2019t help plowing and mowing; if he didn\u2019t, he would go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and die.", " I have no right to, and can\u2019t, believe it.\u201d He remembered the expression D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s face assumed in his moments of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason, or shot a post-boy\u2019s horse with a pistol. That expression was often on D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s face when looking at him. \u201cYes, he is a bully,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cto kill a man means nothing to him. It must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him. He must think that I, too, am afraid of him\u2014and in fact I am afraid of him,\u201d he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul. D\u00f3lokhov, Den\u00edsov, and Rost\u00f3v were now sitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rost\u00f3v was talking merrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner. Rost\u00f3v looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a word\u2014an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rost\u00f3v and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor\u2019s health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.", " Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: \u201cCome here; part the bets!\u201d This was D\u00f3lokhov, an officer of the Sem\u00ebnov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What\u2019s it all about?\u201d \u201cWait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,\u201d said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre. \u201cFirst of all you must drink!\u201d Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre\u2019s glass while explaining that D\u00f3lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out. \u201cGo on, you must drink it all,\u201d said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, \u201cor I won\u2019t let you go!\u201d \u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window. D\u00f3lokhov was holding the Englishman\u2019s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre. D\u00f3lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen.", " Willarski felt dull in Or\u00ebl and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests. But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into apathy and egotism. \u201cYou are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,\u201d he said. But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before. Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs, his wife\u2019s affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family. Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre, without trying to change the other\u2019s views and without condemning him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon. There was a new feature in Pierre\u2019s relations with Willarski, with the princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man\u2019s convictions by words, and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing things each from his own point of view."], "Who is the ownerof the estate called Bald Hills?": [" After the return of Alp\u00e1tych from Smol\u00e9nsk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief\u2019s discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia\u2019s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills. But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguch\u00e1rovo and thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her father\u2019s feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him. She refused to go away and her father\u2019s fury broke over her in a terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her.", " \u201cThe French at V\u00edtebsk, in four days\u2019 march they may be at Smol\u00e9nsk; perhaps are already there! T\u00edkhon!\u201d T\u00edkhon jumped up. \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want anything!\u201d he shouted. He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face, vigorous and alert, entering Pot\u00ebmkin\u2019s gaily colored tent, and a burning sense of jealousy of \u201cthe favorite\u201d agitated him now as strongly as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with Pot\u00ebmkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Z\u00fabov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand. \u201cOh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all the present! Quicker, quicker\u2014and that they should leave me in peace!\u201d CHAPTER IV Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s estate, lay forty miles east from Smol\u00e9nsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow. The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alp\u00e1tych, Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety, though from Prince Andrew\u2019s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alp\u00e1tych to the Provincial Governor at Smol\u00e9nsk, asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed.", " Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling any of his wife\u2019s property, and having received a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well. In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating to buy back Otr\u00e1dnoe\u2014that being his pet dream. Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products, and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate. He always had before his mind\u2019s eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made effective\u2014the peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself.", " Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair. In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smol\u00e9nsk on the sixth of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled. But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously he had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there. He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the march, rode to his father\u2019s estate where he had been born and spent his childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper\u2019s lodge."], "Who is severelywounded at the Battle of Austerlitz?": [" What was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood from this official report that our army had been defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kut\u00fazov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son. \u201cYour son,\u201d wrote Kut\u00fazov, \u201cfell before my eyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of a regiment\u2014he fell as a hero, worthy of his father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.\u201d After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.", " \u201cYes,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, \u201cbut with this little difference, that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me,\u201d he went on, \u201cif things depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow\u2019s battle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends, and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers, and least of all on position.\u201d \u201cBut on what then?\u201d \u201cOn the feeling that is in me and in him,\u201d he pointed to Tim\u00f3khin, \u201cand in each soldier.\u201d Prince Andrew glanced at Tim\u00f3khin, who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him. \u201cA battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours, but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle, and we did lose it.", " My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir\u2014a blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.\u2019 \u201cThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isn\u2019t it logical? \u201cThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal\u2019s departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle. Buxh\u00f6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle \u2018on his own hand\u2019 as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pult\u00fask, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pult\u00fask. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxh\u00f6wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxh\u00f6wden who by right of seniority should be our chief.", " Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had obtained two decorations for Austerlitz. In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also. In 1809 he was a captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special lucrative posts in Petersburg. Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg\u2019s merits, it could not be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent terms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society. Four years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow theater, Berg had pointed out V\u00e9ra Rost\u00f3va to him and had said in German, \u201cdas soll mein Weib werden,\u201d * and from that moment had made up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 position and his own, he decided that the time had come to propose."], "Who is Pierre\u2019sfirst wife?": [" At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s wife, sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife. \u201cNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame,\u201d he thought. If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not? Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph Alex\u00e9evich. This is what he noted in his diary: Moscow, 17th November I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I have experienced. Joseph Alex\u00e9evich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint.", " When Prince Vas\u00edli returned to the drawing room, the princess, his wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre. \u201cOf course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...\u201d \u201cMarriages are made in heaven,\u201d replied the elderly lady. Prince Vas\u00edli passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself. \u201cAline,\u201d he said to his wife, \u201cgo and see what they are about.\u201d The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne still sat talking just as before. \u201cStill the same,\u201d she said to her husband. Prince Vas\u00edli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it. \u201cThank God!\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli. \u201cMy wife has told me everything!\u201d (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter. )\u2014\u201cMy dear boy... L\u00eblya... I am very pleased.\u201d (His voice trembled.) \u201cI loved your father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!...\u201d He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his malodorous mouth.", " It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company. \u201cYou are off to the war, Prince?\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna. \u201cGeneral Kut\u00fazov,\u201d said Bolk\u00f3nski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general\u2019s name like a Frenchman, \u201chas been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....\u201d \u201cAnd Lise, your wife?\u201d \u201cShe will go to the country.\u201d \u201cAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?\u201d \u201cAndr\u00e9,\u201d said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, \u201cthe vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!\u201d Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre\u2019s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile. \u201cThere now!... So you, too, are in the great world?\u201d said he to Pierre.", " When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons. Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse three times and Nat\u00e1sha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her of Rousseau\u2019s view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband himself\u2014who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself, a thing then unheard of and considered injurious\u2014she insisted on having her own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself. It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and delight would find in his wife\u2019s ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion. After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected."], "With which manis it rumored Pierre\u2019s wife is having an affair?": [" At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s wife, sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter.

Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\u00f3lokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see Nat\u00e1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\u2019s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The countess\u2019 drawing room was full of guests. Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return\u2014at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever\u2014entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him. \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room. \u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.", " Can\u2019t I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?\u201d passed through his mind. But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of the onlookers, \u201cWill it be long? Are things ready?\u201d When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers, and the pistols loaded, Nesv\u00edtski went up to Pierre. \u201cI should not be doing my duty, Count,\u201d he said in timid tones, \u201cand should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment I did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no sufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it.... You were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous...\u201d \u201cOh yes, it is horribly stupid,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cThen allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent will accept them,\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski (who like the others concerned in the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that the affair had come to an actual duel). \u201cYou know, Count, it is much more honorable to admit one\u2019s mistake than to let matters become irreparable. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to convey....\u201d \u201cNo! What is there to talk about?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same.... Is everything ready?\u201d he added. \u201cOnly tell me where to go and where to shoot,\u201d he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.", " Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of old Count Bez\u00fakhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vas\u00edli nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bez\u00fakhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince Vas\u00edli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen. I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bez\u00fakhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don\u2019t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bez\u00fakhova."], "What topic doesthe mysterious stranger Pierre encounters at the Torzhok stationdiscuss?": [" Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this stranger. The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be wanted. * To indicate he did not want more tea. \u201cNo. Give me the book,\u201d said the stranger. The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work, and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again, leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and severe gaze straight on Pierre\u2019s face. Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old eyes attracted him irresistibly. CHAPTER II \u201cI have the pleasure of addressing Count Bez\u00fakhov, if I am not mistaken,\u201d said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice. Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles. \u201cI have heard of you, my dear sir,\u201d continued the stranger, \u201cand of your misfortune.\u201d He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to say\u2014\u201cYes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.\u201d\u2014\u201cI regret it very much, my dear sir.\u201d Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.", " \u201cI have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for greater reasons.\u201d He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him. \u201cYou are unhappy, my dear sir,\u201d the stranger continued. \u201cYou are young and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my power.\u201d \u201cOh, yes!\u201d said Pierre, with a forced smile. \u201cI am very grateful to you. Where are you traveling from?\u201d The stranger\u2019s face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to Pierre. \u201cBut if for any reason you don\u2019t feel inclined to talk to me,\u201d said the old man, \u201csay so, my dear sir.\u201d And he suddenly smiled, in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way. \u201cOh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your acquaintance,\u201d said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger\u2019s hands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull\u2014a Masonic sign. \u201cAllow me to ask,\u201d he said, \u201care you a Mason?\u201d \u201cYes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,\u201d said the stranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierre\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd in their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you.\u201d \u201cI am afraid,\u201d said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs\u2014\u201cI am afraid I am very far from understanding\u2014how am I to put it?\u2014I am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another.\u201d \u201cI know your outlook,\u201d said the Mason, \u201cand the view of life you mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts, is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit of pride, indolence, and ignorance.", " Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who, with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with its broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at Bez\u00fakhov. The stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a death\u2019s head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache, evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown. This active old servant was unpacking the traveler\u2019s canteen and preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom he passed it.", " \u201cCorporal, what will they do with the sick man?...\u201d Pierre began. But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierre\u2019s words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick man\u2019s groans. \u201cThere it is!... It again!...\u201d said Pierre to himself, and an involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal\u2019s changed face, in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men\u2014that force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to try to escape that force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait and endure. He did not again go to the sick man, nor turn to look at him, but stood frowning by the door of the hut. When that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do anything for him."], "For what misdeedis Nicholas\u2019s friend Denisov in danger of being court-martialed?": [" CHAPTER XVII After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the Emperor\u2019s stay was the call for contributions of men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable. With the enemy\u2019s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites\u2019 view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it; the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger, since it is not in man\u2019s power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to the first voice, but in society to the second.", " Why, when we were retreating from Sventsy\u00e1ni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all; wasn\u2019t it so, your excellency?\u201d and again Tim\u00f3khin turned to the prince. \u201cBut we daren\u2019t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became straightforward. Now we see light....\u201d \u201cThen why was it forbidden?\u201d Tim\u00f3khin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew. \u201cWhy, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy,\u201d said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. \u201cIt is very sound: one can\u2019t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding. At Smol\u00e9nsk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand this,\u201d cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily: \u201che could not understand that there, for the first time, we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable.", " Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still wet with the night\u2019s rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side. The soldiers\u2019 faces were more and more clearly visible. Rost\u00f3v, always closely followed by Ily\u00edn, rode along the side of the road between two rows of birch trees. When campaigning, Rost\u00f3v allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Don\u00e9ts horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor\u2019s wife, but not once of the impending danger. Formerly, when going into action, Rost\u00f3v had felt afraid; now he had not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him\u2014the impending danger. During the first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time it had come of itself.", " With an effort S\u00f3nya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining. \u201cNicholas is going away in a week\u2019s time, his... papers... have come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,\u201d and she showed a paper she held in her hand\u2014with the verses Nicholas had written, \u201cstill, I should not cry, but you can\u2019t... no one can understand... what a soul he has!\u201d And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and Bor\u00eds also,\u201d she went on, gaining a little strength; \u201che is nice... there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin... one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it can\u2019t be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma\u201d (S\u00f3nya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so) \u201cthat I am spoiling Nicholas\u2019 career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness,\u201d and she made the sign of the cross, \u201cI love her so much, and all of you, only V\u00e9ra... And what for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice everything, only I have nothing....\u201d S\u00f3nya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed. Nat\u00e1sha began consoling her, but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend\u2019s trouble. \u201cS\u00f3nya,\u201d she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend\u2019s sorrow, \u201cI\u2019m sure V\u00e9ra has said something to you since dinner?"], "How does Nicholasrescue Mary?": [" Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life\u2014love\u2014was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life. Prince Andrew\u2019s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat\u00e1sha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother\u2019s bedroom had strained Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s physical strength. One afternoon noticing Nat\u00e1sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Nat\u00e1sha lay down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\u201d \u201cYou are tired\u2014try to sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\u201d \u201cShe is much better. She spoke so well today,\u201d said Princess Mary. Nat\u00e1sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned Princess Mary\u2019s face. \u201cIs she like him?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYes, like and yet not like. But she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\u2019s hand to herself, \u201cMary, you mustn\u2019t think me wicked.", " \u201cWhat is it, Nat\u00e1sha?\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d She smiled at Pierre through her tears. \u201cGood night! It is time for bed.\u201d Pierre rose and took his leave. Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of Pierre nor did Nat\u00e1sha speak of him. \u201cWell, good night, Mary!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cDo you know, I am often afraid that by not speaking of him\u201d (she meant Prince Andrew) \u201cfor fear of not doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.\u201d Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s remark, but she did not express agreement in words. \u201cIs it possible to forget?\u201d said she. \u201cIt did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and painful, but good, very good!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cI am sure he really loved him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?\u201d she added, suddenly blushing. \u201cTo tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cDo you know, Mary...\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, \u201che has somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh\u2014as if he had just come out of a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn\u2019t it true?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Princess Mary. \u201cHe has greatly improved.\u201d \u201cWith a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...\u201d \u201cI understand why he\u201d (Prince Andrew) \u201cliked no one so much as him,\u201d said Princess Mary.", " You look pale. Oh, you are very pale!\u201d said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft, ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law. \u201cYour excellency, should not Mary Bogd\u00e1novna be sent for?\u201d said one of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogd\u00e1novna was a midwife from the neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.) \u201cOh yes,\u201d assented Princess Mary, \u201cperhaps that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll go. Courage, my angel.\u201d She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room. \u201cOh, no, no!\u201d And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princess\u2019 face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself. \u201cNo, it\u2019s only indigestion?... Say it\u2019s only indigestion, say so, Mary! Say...\u201d And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogd\u00e1novna. \u201cMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!\u201d she heard as she left the room. The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump white hands with an air of calm importance. \u201cMary Bogd\u00e1novna, I think it\u2019s beginning!\u201d said Princess Mary looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm. \u201cWell, the Lord be thanked, Princess,\u201d said Mary Bogd\u00e1novna, not hastening her steps. \u201cYou young ladies should not know anything about it.\u201d \u201cBut how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?\u201d said the princess.", " \u201cTo speak to her now wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said the princess all the same. \u201cBut what am I to do?\u201d \u201cLeave it to me,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI know...\u201d Pierre was looking into Princess Mary\u2019s eyes. \u201cWell?... Well?...\u201d he said. \u201cI know that she loves... will love you,\u201d Princess Mary corrected herself. Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized Princess Mary\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?\u201d \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d said Princess Mary with a smile. \u201cWrite to her parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will.\u201d \u201cNo, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can\u2019t be.... How happy I am! No, it can\u2019t be!\u201d Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary\u2019s hands. \u201cGo to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,\u201d she said. \u201cTo Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I\u2019ll go. But I may come again tomorrow?\u201d Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Nat\u00e1sha was less animated than she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. \u201cIs it possible? No, it can\u2019t be,\u201d he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that filled his soul with joy. When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help holding it a little longer in his own."], "What does Pierremadly and briefly imagine his mission in life to be?": [" Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk regiment had stood in front of the house to which Balash\u00ebv was conducted, and now two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balash\u00ebv in the very house in V\u00edlna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission. CHAPTER VI Though Balash\u00ebv was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of Napoleon\u2019s court. The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates\u2014several of whom Balash\u00ebv had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia\u2014were waiting. Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going for his ride. After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balash\u00ebv to follow him. Balash\u00ebv went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps, firm and resolute\u2014they were those of Napoleon.", " Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled. But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does not and cannot believe this. However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would be unable to live for a single moment. He could not live, because all man\u2019s efforts, all his impulses to life, are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger, virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.", " Not having found Kur\u00e1gin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met Kur\u00e1gin, despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him\u2014he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity. In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached Bucharest\u2014where Kut\u00fazov had been living for two months, passing his days and nights with a Wallachian woman\u2014Prince Andrew asked Kut\u00fazov to transfer him to the Western Army. Kut\u00fazov, who was already weary of Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly. Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way, being only two miles off the Smol\u00e9nsk highroad. During the last three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail.", " And he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest. On the twenty-ninth of November Kut\u00fazov entered V\u00edlna\u2014his \u201cdear V\u00edlna\u201d as he called it. Twice during his career Kut\u00fazov had been governor of V\u00edlna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed, immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all. Chichag\u00f3v, one of the most zealous \u201ccutters-off\u201d and \u201cbreakers-up,\u201d who had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent: Chichag\u00f3v, noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered Kut\u00fazov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with Turkey in 1811 independently of Kut\u00fazov, and found that peace had already been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really Kut\u00fazov\u2019s; this Chichag\u00f3v was the first to meet Kut\u00fazov at the castle where the latter was to stay."], "How does Heleneattempt to marry another man while still wedded to Pierre?": [" Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk\u2014as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out. \u201cNever, never marry, my dear fellow! That\u2019s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing\u2014or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don\u2019t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what\u2019s the good?...\u201d and he waved his arm. Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement. \u201cMy wife,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, \u201cis an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a man\u2019s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like you.\u201d As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolk\u00f3nski who had lolled in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth.", " \u201cWell, dear heart,\u201d said he, \u201cI wanted to tell you about it yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything like it before. I am in love, my friend!\u201d Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on the sofa beside Prince Andrew. \u201cWith Nat\u00e1sha Rost\u00f3va, yes?\u201d said he. \u201cYes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it, but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can\u2019t live without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why don\u2019t you speak?\u201d \u201cI? I? What did I tell you?\u201d said Pierre suddenly, rising and beginning to pace up and down the room. \u201cI always thought it.... That girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend, I entreat you, don\u2019t philosophize, don\u2019t doubt, marry, marry, marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.\u201d \u201cBut what of her?\u201d \u201cShe loves you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish...\u201d said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into Pierre\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe does, I know,\u201d Pierre cried fiercely. \u201cBut do listen,\u201d returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the arm. \u201cDo you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone.\u201d \u201cWell, go on, go on. I am very glad,\u201d said Pierre, and his face really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince Andrew.", " You know me and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have been and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him about the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months.\u201d After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly: \u201cWrite and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won\u2019t be long\u2014I shall soon set him free.\u201d The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak and, raising his voice more and more, cried: \u201cMarry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich, eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholas\u2019 stepmother and I\u2019ll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustn\u2019t be without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted in my house\u2014let him marry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go and live with him too?\u201d he added, turning to Princess Mary. \u201cGo in heaven\u2019s name! Go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!\u201d After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.", " And do you know the new way of courting?\u201d said Pierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Princess Mary. \u201cTo please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is very melancholy with Mademoiselle Kar\u00e1gina,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cReally?\u201d asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre\u2019s kindly face and still thinking of her own sorrow. \u201cIt would be a relief,\u201d thought she, \u201cif I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone. I should like to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It would be a relief. He would give me advice.\u201d \u201cWould you marry him?\u201d \u201cOh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!\u201d she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice. \u201cAh, how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that...\u201d she went on in a trembling voice, \u201cthat you can do nothing for him but grieve him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then there is only one thing left\u2014to go away, but where could I go?\u201d \u201cWhat is wrong? What is it, Princess?\u201d But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is the matter with me today. Don\u2019t take any notice\u2014forget what I have said!\u201d Pierre\u2019s gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the princess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble except the one he knew of\u2014that Prince Andrew\u2019s marriage threatened to cause a rupture between father and son."], "Why do the Rostovsunload the carts containing their possessions during the evacuationof Moscow?": [" In the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and one\u2019s own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one\u2019s own family. So thought the major-domo on his master\u2019s behalf. On waking up that morning Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v left his bedroom softly, so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning, and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown.", " On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him under her wing, P\u00e9tya guessed her designs, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her\u2014might \u201cbecome womanish\u201d as he termed it to himself\u2014he treated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached himself exclusively to Nat\u00e1sha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like. Owing to the count\u2019s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to come from their Ryaz\u00e1n and Moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth. From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodin\u00f3 were brought in by the Dorogom\u00edlov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow, and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates. In spite of Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s broadsheets, or because of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave.", " I\u2019ll go to the police officer, and you tell them so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.\u201d \u201cI understand.\u201d Alp\u00e1tych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive \u201cI understand\u201d from Dron, Alp\u00e1tych contented himself with that, though he not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be forthcoming. And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the princess, Alp\u00e1tych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for the princess\u2019 carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities. CHAPTER X After her father\u2019s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alp\u00e1tych was asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace.", " \u201cThe eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,\u201d muttered the count through tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of shame on his breast. \u201cPapa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cWe will still take all the most necessary things.\u201d The count nodded affirmatively, and Nat\u00e1sha, at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard. The servants gathered round Nat\u00e1sha, but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself, in his wife\u2019s name, confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do. The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 yard."], "According tothe narrator of War and Peace, which of the following best describesthe Battle of Borodino?": [" \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored. \u201cBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country\u2019s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone.", " Then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel. The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event. After the burning of Smol\u00e9nsk a war began which did not follow any previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodin\u00f3 and the renewed retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules. Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent\u2019s rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kut\u00fazov and to the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules\u2014as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit thrust en prime, and so on\u2014the cudgel of the people\u2019s war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting anyone\u2019s tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French till the whole invasion had perished.", " My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir\u2014a blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.\u2019 \u201cThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isn\u2019t it logical? \u201cThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal\u2019s departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle. Buxh\u00f6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle \u2018on his own hand\u2019 as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pult\u00fask, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pult\u00fask. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxh\u00f6wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxh\u00f6wden who by right of seniority should be our chief.", " I remember, yes, I remember you with the standard!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, and a flush of pleasure suffused Prince Andrew\u2019s face at this recollection. Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kut\u00fazov offered his cheek to be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man\u2019s eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kut\u00fazov\u2019s tears came easily, and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him. \u201cGo your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of honor!\u201d He paused. \u201cI missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to send.\u201d And changing the subject, Kut\u00fazov began to speak of the Turkish war and the peace that had been concluded. \u201cYes, I have been much blamed,\u201d he said, \u201cboth for that war and the peace... but everything came at the right time. Tout vient \u00e0 point \u00e0 celui qui sait attendre. * And there were as many advisers there as here...\u201d he went on, returning to the subject of \u201cadvisers\u201d which evidently occupied him. \u201cAh, those advisers!\u201d said he. \u201cIf we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. K\u00e1menski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign."], "In what publicplace does Natasha become interested in Anatole?": [" Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety. Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him. \u201cYou promised Countess Rost\u00f3va to marry her and were about to elope with her, is that so?\u201d \u201cMon cher,\u201d answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French), \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone.\u201d Pierre\u2019s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till Anatole\u2019s face showed a sufficient degree of terror. \u201cWhen I tell you that I must talk to you!...\u201d repeated Pierre. \u201cCome now, this is stupid. What?\u201d said Anatole, fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth. \u201cYou\u2019re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don\u2019t know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!\u201d said Pierre, expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French. He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put it back in its place. \u201cDid you promise to marry her?\u201d \u201cI... I didn\u2019t think of it. I never promised, because...\u201d Pierre interrupted him. \u201cHave you any letters of hers? Any letters?\u201d he said, moving toward Anatole. Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook.", " He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home. Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\u00f3lokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see Nat\u00e1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\u2019s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The countess\u2019 drawing room was full of guests. Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return\u2014at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever\u2014entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him. \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room. \u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.", " \u201cNow you, young prince, what\u2019s your name?\u201d said Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, turning to Anatole, \u201ccome here, let us talk and get acquainted.\u201d \u201cNow the fun begins,\u201d thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince. \u201cWell, my dear boy, I hear you\u2019ve been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?\u201d asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently. \u201cNo, I have been transferred to the line,\u201d said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter. \u201cAh! That\u2019s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?\u201d \u201cNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?\u201d said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh. \u201cA splendid soldier, splendid! \u2018What am I attached to!\u2019 Ha, ha, ha!\u201d laughed Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolk\u00f3nski frowned. \u201cYou may go,\u201d he said to Anatole. Anatole returned smiling to the ladies. \u201cAnd so you\u2019ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vas\u00edli, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said the old prince to Prince Vas\u00edli. \u201cI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours.\u201d \u201cYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad\u2019s a fine fellow, a fine fellow!", " D\u00f3lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an ironic smile: \u201cDo you know? You\u2019d really better drop it all. There\u2019s still time!\u201d \u201cFool,\u201d retorted Anatole. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! If you only knew... it\u2019s the devil knows what!\u201d \u201cNo, really, give it up!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI am speaking seriously. It\u2019s no joke, this plot you\u2019ve hatched.\u201d \u201cWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?\u201d said Anatole, making a grimace. \u201cReally it\u2019s no time for your stupid jokes,\u201d and he left the room. D\u00f3lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out. \u201cYou wait a bit,\u201d he called after him. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, I\u2019m talking sense. Come here, come here!\u201d Anatole returned and looked at D\u00f3lokhov, trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily. \u201cNow listen to me. I\u2019m telling you this for the last time. Why should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I did it all.\u201d \u201cWell, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?\u201d And Anatole sighed and embraced D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a dangerous business, and if you think about it\u2014a stupid business. Well, you\u2019ll carry her off\u2014all right! Will they let it stop at that? It will come out that you\u2019re already married. Why, they\u2019ll have you in the criminal court....\u201d \u201cOh, nonsense, nonsense!\u201d Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace."], "For what doesthe dying Count Rostov beg forgiveness?": [" \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped! It happens to everyone!\u201d said the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father\u2019s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone! The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\u2019s words and began bustlingly searching for something. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he muttered, \u201cit will be difficult, I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\u201d And with a furtive glance at his son\u2019s face, the count went out of the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all expected this. \u201cPapa! Pa-pa!\u201d he called after him, sobbing, \u201cforgive me!\u201d And seizing his father\u2019s hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears. While father and son were having their explanation, the mother and daughter were having one not less important. Nat\u00e1sha came running to her mother, quite excited. \u201cMamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...\u201d \u201cMade what?\u201d \u201cMade, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!\u201d she exclaimed. The countess did not believe her ears. Den\u00edsov had proposed. To whom? To this chit of a girl, Nat\u00e1sha, who not so long ago was playing with dolls and who was still having lessons. \u201cDon\u2019t, Nat\u00e1sha! What nonsense!\u201d she said, hoping it was a joke. \u201cNonsense, indeed!", " We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty churches\u2014but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.\u201d So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it were something new. \u201cI understand the deception and confusion,\u201d he thought, \u201cbut how am I to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears that it must be so! But I\u2014what is to become of me?\u201d thought he. He had the unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he had to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them.", " He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vas\u00edli left the chair on which he had been leaning, and\u2014with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them\u2014did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vas\u00edli and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential. The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s was the most distinct.", " \u201cCan she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?\u201d she thought when she reflected on the change. But when she was with Nat\u00e1sha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power of life that had seized Nat\u00e1sha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart. Nat\u00e1sha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright and cheerful. When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with Pierre, Nat\u00e1sha met her on the threshold. \u201cHe has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?\u201d she repeated. And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face. \u201cI wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.\u201d Understandable and touching as the look with which Nat\u00e1sha gazed at her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation, these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his love. \u201cBut what\u2019s to be done? She can\u2019t help it,\u201d thought the princess. And with a sad and rather stern look she told Nat\u00e1sha all that Pierre had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Nat\u00e1sha was astounded. \u201cTo Petersburg!\u201d she repeated as if unable to understand. But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary\u2019s face she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry."], "Who is Mary\u2019sbrother?": [" Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life\u2014love\u2014was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life. Prince Andrew\u2019s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat\u00e1sha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother\u2019s bedroom had strained Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s physical strength. One afternoon noticing Nat\u00e1sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Nat\u00e1sha lay down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\u201d \u201cYou are tired\u2014try to sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\u201d \u201cShe is much better. She spoke so well today,\u201d said Princess Mary. Nat\u00e1sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned Princess Mary\u2019s face. \u201cIs she like him?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYes, like and yet not like. But she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\u2019s hand to herself, \u201cMary, you mustn\u2019t think me wicked.", " \u201cWhat is it, Nat\u00e1sha?\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d She smiled at Pierre through her tears. \u201cGood night! It is time for bed.\u201d Pierre rose and took his leave. Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of Pierre nor did Nat\u00e1sha speak of him. \u201cWell, good night, Mary!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cDo you know, I am often afraid that by not speaking of him\u201d (she meant Prince Andrew) \u201cfor fear of not doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.\u201d Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s remark, but she did not express agreement in words. \u201cIs it possible to forget?\u201d said she. \u201cIt did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and painful, but good, very good!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cI am sure he really loved him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?\u201d she added, suddenly blushing. \u201cTo tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cDo you know, Mary...\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, \u201che has somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh\u2014as if he had just come out of a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn\u2019t it true?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Princess Mary. \u201cHe has greatly improved.\u201d \u201cWith a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...\u201d \u201cI understand why he\u201d (Prince Andrew) \u201cliked no one so much as him,\u201d said Princess Mary.", " You look pale. Oh, you are very pale!\u201d said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft, ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law. \u201cYour excellency, should not Mary Bogd\u00e1novna be sent for?\u201d said one of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogd\u00e1novna was a midwife from the neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.) \u201cOh yes,\u201d assented Princess Mary, \u201cperhaps that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll go. Courage, my angel.\u201d She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room. \u201cOh, no, no!\u201d And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princess\u2019 face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself. \u201cNo, it\u2019s only indigestion?... Say it\u2019s only indigestion, say so, Mary! Say...\u201d And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogd\u00e1novna. \u201cMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!\u201d she heard as she left the room. The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump white hands with an air of calm importance. \u201cMary Bogd\u00e1novna, I think it\u2019s beginning!\u201d said Princess Mary looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm. \u201cWell, the Lord be thanked, Princess,\u201d said Mary Bogd\u00e1novna, not hastening her steps. \u201cYou young ladies should not know anything about it.\u201d \u201cBut how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?\u201d said the princess.", " \u201cTo speak to her now wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said the princess all the same. \u201cBut what am I to do?\u201d \u201cLeave it to me,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI know...\u201d Pierre was looking into Princess Mary\u2019s eyes. \u201cWell?... Well?...\u201d he said. \u201cI know that she loves... will love you,\u201d Princess Mary corrected herself. Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized Princess Mary\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?\u201d \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d said Princess Mary with a smile. \u201cWrite to her parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will.\u201d \u201cNo, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can\u2019t be.... How happy I am! No, it can\u2019t be!\u201d Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary\u2019s hands. \u201cGo to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,\u201d she said. \u201cTo Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I\u2019ll go. But I may come again tomorrow?\u201d Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Nat\u00e1sha was less animated than she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. \u201cIs it possible? No, it can\u2019t be,\u201d he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that filled his soul with joy. When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help holding it a little longer in his own."], "What good deedends up getting Pierre captured by the French?": [" Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him. \u201cLieutenant, he has a dagger,\u201d were the first words Pierre understood. \u201cAh, a weapon?\u201d said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with Pierre. \u201cAll right, you can tell all about it at the court-martial.\u201d Then he turned to Pierre. \u201cDo you speak French?\u201d Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of Pierre. \u201cDo you speak French?\u201d the officer asked again, keeping at a distance from Pierre. \u201cCall the interpreter.\u201d A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops. \u201cHe does not look like a common man,\u201d said the interpreter, after a searching look at Pierre. \u201cAh, he looks very much like an incendiary,\u201d remarked the officer.", " He looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face. \u201cWhy\u2019s that fellow in front of the line?\u201d shouted somebody at him again. \u201cTo the left!... Keep to the right!\u201d the men shouted to him. Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded. \u201cHow have you got here?\u201d he said, and galloped on. Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of getting in someone\u2019s way again, galloped after the adjutant. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here? May I come with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cOne moment, one moment!\u201d replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and then addressed Pierre. \u201cWhy have you come here, Count?\u201d he asked with a smile. \u201cStill inquisitive?\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d assented Pierre. But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on. \u201cHere it\u2019s tolerable,\u201d said he, \u201cbut with Bagrati\u00f3n on the left flank they\u2019re getting it frightfully hot.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cWhere is that?\u201d \u201cCome along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in our battery it is still bearable,\u201d said the adjutant. \u201cWill you come?\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ll come with you,\u201d replied Pierre, looking round for his groom. It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers.", " But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the new guard\u2014both officers and men\u2014he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason by order of the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer. All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him. That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms. With the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners, and which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object, and so on.", " When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners. They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone at last he opened and read his wife\u2019s letter. \u201cThey, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One must forget and understand...\u201d And going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep. When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count Rostopch\u00edn to know whether Count Bez\u00fakhov had left or was leaving the town. A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see them, went to the back porch and out through the gate. From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again or knew where he was. CHAPTER XII The Rost\u00f3vs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is, till the eve of the enemy\u2019s entry into the city."], "What causes Petya\u2019sdeath?": [" Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows. The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power\u2014the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and guns\u2014should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes.", " We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smol\u00e9nsk and Moscow and were killed by them. To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war.", " To discover and define those laws is the problem of history. From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in man\u2019s free will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible, for however man\u2019s free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes impossible. Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as its problem. The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self-destruction toward which\u2014ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena\u2014the old method of history is moving. All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all unknown, infinitely small, elements. In another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded.", " If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton\u2014then, knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result. On these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation, and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action. CHAPTER X Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a man\u2019s life. So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known, where the time between the action and its examination is great, and where the causes of the action are most accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will."], "Through whatRussian city, occupied by the French, does Pierre wander?": [" Many of them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select cal\u00e8ches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered. There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city. The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme f\u00e9roce de Rostopch\u00edne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality, however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible for it.", " Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner.

Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it. \u201cCette ville asiatique aux innombrables \u00e9glises, Moscou la sainte. La voil\u00e0 donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il \u00e9tait temps,\u201d * said he, and dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and summoned Lelorgne d\u2019Ideville, the interpreter. * \u201cThat Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was high time.\u201d \u201cA town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,\u201d thought he (he had said so to T\u00fachkov at Smol\u00e9nsk). From that point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable, had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him. \u201cBut could it be otherwise?\u201d he thought. \u201cHere is this capital at my feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking?", " Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tut\u00f3lmin, he dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate. With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopch\u00edn was punished by an order to burn down his houses. With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a constitution. A municipality was established and the following announcement issued: INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW! Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm. The city police is established on its former footing, and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city."], "How does PlatonKarataev die?": [" The first death I saw, and one I shall never forget\u2014that of my dear sister-in-law\u2014left that impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though generally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother\u2019s duties. As a young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not a single hair of our heads will fall without His will.", " Stopping in front of the P\u00e1vlograds, the Tsar said something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled. Seeing that smile, Rost\u00f3v involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him. \u201cOh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI should die of happiness!\u201d The Tsar addressed the officers also: \u201cI thank you all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart.\u201d To Rost\u00f3v every word sounded like a voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar! \u201cYou have earned the St. George\u2019s standards and will be worthy of them.\u201d \u201cOh, to die, to die for him,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. The Tsar said something more which Rost\u00f3v did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d Rost\u00f3v too, bending over his saddle, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully. The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided. \u201cHow can the Emperor be undecided?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything else the Tsar did. That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar\u2019s foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp.", " Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition. Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the officers\u2019 saying that it was humiliating to look at the French, Rost\u00f3v began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the officers: \u201cHow can you judge what\u2019s best?\u201d he cried, the blood suddenly rushing to his face. \u201cHow can you judge the Emperor\u2019s actions? What right have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor\u2019s aims or his actions!\u201d \u201cBut I never said a word about the Emperor!\u201d said the officer, justifying himself, and unable to understand Rost\u00f3v\u2019s outburst, except on the supposition that he was drunk. But Rost\u00f3v did not listen to him. \u201cWe are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,\u201d he went on. \u201cIf we are ordered to die, we must die. If we\u2019re punished, it means that we have deserved it, it\u2019s not for us to judge.", " The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts. Late that night, when all had separated, Den\u00edsov with his short hand patted his favorite, Rost\u00f3v, on the shoulder. \u201cAs there\u2019s no one to fall in love with on campaign, he\u2019s fallen in love with the Tsar,\u201d he said. \u201cDen\u00edsov, don\u2019t make fun of it!\u201d cried Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIt is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...\u201d \u201cI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...\u201d \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d And Rost\u00f3v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to die\u2014not in saving the Emperor\u2019s life (he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms. CHAPTER XI The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded."], "What does Natashado when Andrew rejects her?": [" Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit. My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vas\u00edli. In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husband. I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one, however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you are\u2014at the heart of affairs and of the world\u2014is the talk all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature\u2014which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country\u2014rumors of war are heard and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene....", " He did it all silently and very quickly. He stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed. \u201cForgive me for troubling you....\u201d Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Nat\u00e1sha, and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued: \u201cI have received a refusal from Countess Rost\u00f3va and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind. Is that true?\u201d \u201cBoth true and untrue,\u201d Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cHere are her letters and her portrait,\u201d said he. He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre. \u201cGive this to the countess... if you see her.\u201d \u201cShe is very ill,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cThen she is here still?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cAnd Prince Kur\u00e1gin?\u201d he added quickly. \u201cHe left long ago. She has been at death\u2019s door.\u201d \u201cI much regret her illness,\u201d said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly. \u201cSo Monsieur Kur\u00e1gin has not honored Countess Rost\u00f3va with his hand?\u201d said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times. \u201cHe could not marry, for he was married already,\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father. \u201cAnd where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?\u201d he said. \u201cHe has gone to Peters... But I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Pierre.", " The angel\u2019s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angel\u2019s face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel\u2019s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: \u201cAh, why have you done this to me?\u201d Soon after Prince Andrew\u2019s return the old prince made over to him a large estate, Boguch\u00e1rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father\u2019s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Boguch\u00e1rovo, began building and spent most of his time there. After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man, roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.", " \u201cWell, go on!\u201d said his son. Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out of the room. As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity, and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible. \u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to go, Andrew?\u201d asked his sister. \u201cThank God that I can,\u201d replied Prince Andrew. \u201cI am very sorry you can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d replied Princess Mary. \u201cWhy do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle Bourienne says he has been asking about you....\u201d As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room. \u201cAh, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what\u2014what trash\u2014can cause people misery!\u201d he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary. She understood that when speaking of \u201ctrash\u201d he referred not only to Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness. \u201cAndrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!\u201d she said, touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. \u201cI understand you\u201d (she looked down). \u201cDon\u2019t imagine that sorrow is the work of men. Men are His tools.\u201d She looked a little above Prince Andrew\u2019s head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs."], "As the novel opens, whose conquest is causing nervousness across Russia?": [" \u201cThere, my dear princess, I\u2019ve brought you my songstress,\u201d said the count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince might appear. \u201cI am so glad you should get to know one another... very sorry the prince is still ailing,\u201d and after a few more commonplace remarks he rose. \u201cIf you\u2019ll allow me to leave my Nat\u00e1sha in your hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I\u2019ll drive round to see Anna Sem\u00ebnovna, it\u2019s quite near in the Dogs\u2019 Square, and then I\u2019ll come back for her.\u201d The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention this to his daughter, but Nat\u00e1sha noticed her father\u2019s nervousness and anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The princess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him to stay longer at Anna Sem\u00ebnovna\u2019s, and he departed. Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary\u2014who wished to have a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Nat\u00e1sha\u2014Mademoiselle Bourienne remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and theaters. Nat\u00e1sha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom, by her father\u2019s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess who\u2014she thought\u2014was making a favor of receiving her, and so everything displeased her.", " The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodin\u00f3 to the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else. The French historians, describing the condition of the French army before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army, except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport\u2014there was no forage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the French have it. The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered them, but burned it instead. Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it.", " If you want anything come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.\u201d Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter had left the room Kut\u00fazov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis. Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that interview with Kut\u00fazov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man\u2014in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions, and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events\u2014the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should. \u201cHe will not bring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake anything,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cbut he will hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will\u2014the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else. And above all,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cone believes in him because he\u2019s Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: \u2018What they have brought us to!\u2019 and had a sob in it when he said he would \u2018make them eat horseflesh!\u2019\u201d On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the popular choice of Kut\u00fazov as commander in chief was received.", " Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless. The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of Matr\u00ebshka the vivandi\u00e8re, and like matters. As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rost\u00f3v took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually, without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the state of Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to think about it, that Kut\u00fazov and others were there for that purpose, but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years\u2019 time."], "Which of the following contributes to Pierre\u2019s decision to become involved with Freemasonry?": [" \u201cNo, but why do you think so?\u201d Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge, \u201cwhy do you think so? You should not think so.\u201d \u201cThink? What about?\u201d asked Prince Andrew with surprise. \u201cAbout life, about man\u2019s destiny. It can\u2019t be so. I myself thought like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don\u2019t smile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, aspects of humanity.\u201d And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood, and love. \u201cOnly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest is a dream,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cUnderstand, my dear fellow, that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven,\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to Pierre\u2019s words.", " Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph Alex\u00e9evich himself, but he did not share their interests. His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry. In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him, seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so. In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master of the principal lodge. Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged, particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre\u2019s observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge. Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles.", " \u201cWhy have you, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?\u201d At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew, Smolyan\u00ednov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an acquaintance\u2014he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor. For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to repeat his question. \u201cYes... I... I... desire regeneration,\u201d Pierre uttered with difficulty. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Smolyan\u00ednov, and went on at once: \u201cHave you any idea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your aim?\u201d said he quietly and quickly. \u201cI... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,\u201d said Pierre, with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in Russian. \u201cWhat is your conception of Freemasonry?\u201d \u201cI imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who have virtuous aims,\u201d said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke.", " Is that true?\u201d \u201cBut I am three times as rich as before,\u201d returned Pierre. Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife\u2019s debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before. \u201cWhat I have certainly gained is freedom,\u201d he began seriously, but did not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic. \u201cAnd are you building?\u201d \u201cYes. Sav\u00e9lich says I must!\u201d \u201cTell me, you did not know of the countess\u2019 death when you decided to remain in Moscow?\u201d asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended. \u201cNo,\u201d answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning Princess Mary had given to his words. \u201cI heard of it in Or\u00ebl and you cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,\u201d he added quickly, glancing at Nat\u00e1sha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife, \u201cbut her death shocked me terribly. When two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and one\u2019s own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation! I am very, very sorry for her,\u201d he concluded, and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face. \u201cYes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,\u201d said Princess Mary."], "Who is defeated in a decisive battle at Borodino?": [" This procrastinator Kut\u00fazov, whose motto was \u201cPatience and Time,\u201d this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodin\u00f3, investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kut\u00fazov who before the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodin\u00f3 was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought, and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia crossed. It is easy now to understand the significance of these events\u2014if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals\u2014for the events and results now lie before us. But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion, so truly discern the importance of the people\u2019s view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it? The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength. Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar\u2019s wish, to select him\u2014an old man in disfavor\u2014to be their representative in the national war.", " The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci, aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy to influence Alexander, and Pfuel\u2019s whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division, and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else, instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal. At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled. He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief\u2019s undivided control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsar\u00e9vich, and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these \u201ceyes of the Emperor,\u201d became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.", " My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir\u2014a blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.\u2019 \u201cThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isn\u2019t it logical? \u201cThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal\u2019s departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle. Buxh\u00f6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle \u2018on his own hand\u2019 as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pult\u00fask, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pult\u00fask. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxh\u00f6wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxh\u00f6wden who by right of seniority should be our chief.", " What was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood from this official report that our army had been defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kut\u00fazov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son. \u201cYour son,\u201d wrote Kut\u00fazov, \u201cfell before my eyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of a regiment\u2014he fell as a hero, worthy of his father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.\u201d After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone."], "Pierre decides he is destined to do what?": [" Besides his height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong. The French followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who were explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French. Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man\u2019s musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night\u2019s experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed the Arb\u00e1t more than four hours previously on his way from the Dorogom\u00edlov suburb to the Kr\u00e9mlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Kr\u00e9mlin, giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants.", " But the idea that he, L\u2019russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and left no trace behind. When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the Rost\u00f3vs and Nat\u00e1sha had said to him: \u201cAre you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!\u201d the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing, even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was predestined to do. Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe\u2014which it seemed to him was solely due to Napoleon. Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte\u2019s life in 1809 by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot. And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited him still more. Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose.", " Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre\u2019s presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had said. Pierre\u2019s past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Nat\u00e1sha (of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierre\u2019s friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember\u2014all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint. From broken remarks about Nat\u00e1sha and his father, from the emotion with which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent tenderness with which Nat\u00e1sha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had loved Nat\u00e1sha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture.", " It was said that Prince Vas\u00edli and the old count had turned upon the Italian, but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop. Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor\u2019s lack of news, the loss of Kut\u00e1ysov, and the death of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. On the third day after Kut\u00fazov\u2019s report a country gentleman arrived from Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through the whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor to be in! Kut\u00fazov was a traitor, and Prince Vas\u00edli during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter\u2019s death said of Kut\u00fazov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man. \u201cI only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such a man.\u201d As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it, but the next day the following communication was received from Count Rostopch\u00edn: Prince Kut\u00fazov\u2019s adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands police officers to guide the army to the Ryaz\u00e1n road. He writes that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kut\u00fazov\u2019s action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors!"], "The novel ends with which of the following?": [" \u201cAnd what does she want the money for?

His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. \u201cAnd why did she resist her seducer when she loved him?\u201d he thought. \u201cGod could not have put into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife\u2014as she once was\u2014did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been found out, nothing discovered,\u201d Pierre again said to himself. \u201cAll we can know is that we know nothing. And that\u2019s the height of human wisdom.\u201d Everything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction. \u201cI make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this gentleman,\u201d said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another traveler, also detained for lack of horses. The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color.", " If you want anything come straight to me.

CHAPTER XXIV On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with Kut\u00fazov, Count Rostopch\u00edn had returned to Moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and because Kut\u00fazov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this, Rostopch\u00edn had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kut\u00fazov. This letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryaz\u00e1n road beyond Moscow. This was not news to Rostopch\u00edn.", " She tried several times to wake P\u00e9tya that he might eat something, but he only muttered incoherent words without waking up. Nat\u00e1sha felt so lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause, such as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in one\u2019s own house, \u201cUncle,\u201d answering a thought that was in his visitors\u2019 minds, said: \u201cThis, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come. That\u2019s it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?\u201d \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d face was very significant and even handsome as he said this. Involuntarily Rost\u00f3v recalled all the good he had heard about him from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province \u201cUncle\u201d had the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes, chose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a justice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused public appointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in summer. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you enter the service, Uncle?\u201d \u201cI did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That\u2019s it, come on! I can\u2019t make head or tail of it. That\u2019s for you\u2014I haven\u2019t brains enough. Now, hunting is another matter\u2014that\u2019s it, come on!"], "At the society party, Anna refers to whom as \u201cthe Antichrist\u201d?": [" But I warn you, if you don\u2019t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist\u2014I really believe he is Antichrist\u2014I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my \u2018faithful slave,\u2019 as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you\u2014sit down and tell me all the news.\u201d It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna P\u00e1vlovna Sch\u00e9rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress M\u00e1rya F\u00ebdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vas\u00edli Kur\u00e1gin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna P\u00e1vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite. All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows: \u201cIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10\u2014Annette Sch\u00e9rer.\u201d \u201cHeavens! what a virulent attack!\u201d replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face.", " \u201cI knew you would be here,\u201d replied Pierre. \u201cI will come to supper with you. May I?\u201d he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story. \u201cNo, impossible!\u201d said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre\u2019s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vas\u00edli and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass. \u201cYou must excuse me, dear Vicomte,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising. \u201cThis unfortunate fete at the ambassador\u2019s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party,\u201d said he, turning to Anna P\u00e1vlovna. His daughter, Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him. \u201cVery lovely,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cVery,\u201d said Pierre. In passing Prince Vas\u00edli seized Pierre\u2019s hand and said to Anna P\u00e1vlovna: \u201cEducate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women.\u201d Anna P\u00e1vlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s.", " At that time a famous joke of Erm\u00f3lov\u2019s was being circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering Suv\u00f3rov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia, and not let the army get discouraged. To the third party\u2014in which the Emperor had most confidence\u2014belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakch\u00e9ev belonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now), needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel\u2019s opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel\u2019s plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party.", " How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. We women, Prince,\u201d and she smiled tenderly, \u201calways know how to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me. I am used to suffering.\u201d Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cWould not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna?\u201d said he. \u201cLet us wait until evening. The doctors are expecting a crisis.\u201d \u201cBut one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...\u201d A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the count\u2019s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vas\u00edli turned to her. \u201cWell, how is he?\u201d \u201cStill the same; but what can you expect, this noise...\u201d said the princess, looking at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna as at a stranger. \u201cAh, my dear, I hardly knew you,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count\u2019s niece. \u201cI have come, and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have gone through,\u201d and she sympathetically turned up her eyes. The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vas\u00edli to take a seat beside her."], "In a conversation with Andrew, Pierre expresses a belief in the possibility of what?": [" She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball. Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his friend\u2019s face. Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with his back to Nat\u00e1sha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend. \u201cSomething very important is happening between them,\u201d thought Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him neglect the game. After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing like that, and Pierre was released. Nat\u00e1sha on one side was talking with S\u00f3nya and Bor\u00eds, and V\u00e9ra with a subtle smile was saying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. V\u00e9ra, having noticed Prince Andrew\u2019s attentions to Nat\u00e1sha, decided that at a party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact. When Pierre went up to them he noticed that V\u00e9ra was being carried away by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him.", " He did it all silently and very quickly. He stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed. \u201cForgive me for troubling you....\u201d Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Nat\u00e1sha, and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued: \u201cI have received a refusal from Countess Rost\u00f3va and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind. Is that true?\u201d \u201cBoth true and untrue,\u201d Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cHere are her letters and her portrait,\u201d said he. He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre. \u201cGive this to the countess... if you see her.\u201d \u201cShe is very ill,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cThen she is here still?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cAnd Prince Kur\u00e1gin?\u201d he added quickly. \u201cHe left long ago. She has been at death\u2019s door.\u201d \u201cI much regret her illness,\u201d said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly. \u201cSo Monsieur Kur\u00e1gin has not honored Countess Rost\u00f3va with his hand?\u201d said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times. \u201cHe could not marry, for he was married already,\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father. \u201cAnd where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?\u201d he said. \u201cHe has gone to Peters... But I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Pierre.", " \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cTell Countess Rost\u00f3va that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is good.\u201d Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say anything, looked fixedly at him. \u201cI say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?\u201d asked Pierre, \u201cabout...\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d returned Prince Andrew hastily. \u201cI said that a fallen woman should be forgiven, but I didn\u2019t say I could forgive her. I can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cBut can this be compared...?\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: \u201cYes, ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but I am unable to follow in that gentleman\u2019s footsteps. If you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So you\u2019ll give her the packet?\u201d Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary. The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the Rost\u00f3vs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else. At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming evident.", " The officers gazed with surprise at Pierre\u2019s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander. \u201cSo you understand the whole position of our troops?\u201d Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cYes\u2014that is, how do you mean?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cNot being a military man I can\u2019t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general position.\u201d \u201cWell, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cOh!\u201d said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince Andrew. \u201cWell, and what do you think of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s appointment?\u201d he asked. \u201cI was very glad of his appointment, that\u2019s all I know,\u201d replied Prince Andrew. \u201cAnd tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?\u201d \u201cAsk them,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers. Pierre looked at Tim\u00f3khin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer. \u201cWe see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your excellency,\u201d said Tim\u00f3khin timidly, and continually turning to glance at his colonel. \u201cWhy so?\u201d asked Pierre. \u201cWell, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you."], "When Natasha appears, what is she carrying?": [" A man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life. If the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason. This unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled by experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question. Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God. What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of man\u2019s freedom? That is a question for theology. The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics. What is man\u2019s responsibility to society, the conception of which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for jurisprudence. Man\u2019s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a question for ethics. Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that connection appears to be free.", " If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it\u2014good, agreeable, and even essential\u2014would not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back in memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my judgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action. In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants, but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible. And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear. The Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroes\u2019 will.", " We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smol\u00e9nsk and Moscow and were killed by them. To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war.", " \u201cMust one die like a dog?\u201d said he. T\u00fashin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry. \u201cA nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow countrymen. Thanks for the fire\u2014we\u2019ll return it with interest,\u201d said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick. Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed by the fire. One of them stumbled. \u201cWho the devil has put the logs on the road?\u201d snarled he. \u201cHe\u2019s dead\u2014why carry him?\u201d said another. \u201cShut up!\u201d And they disappeared into the darkness with their load. \u201cStill aching?\u201d T\u00fashin asked Rost\u00f3v in a whisper. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYour honor, you\u2019re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,\u201d said a gunner, coming up to T\u00fashin. \u201cComing, friend.\u201d T\u00fashin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, walked away from the fire. Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared for him, Prince Bagrati\u00f3n sat at dinner, talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherk\u00f3v, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes."], "Out of concern about their own inheritances, Vasili and Catherine attempt to destroy what?": [" But if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the Russians of that day desired\u2014to drive the French out of Russia and destroy their army\u2014it is quite clear that the battle of Tar\u00fatino, just because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign. It would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. With a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the greatest confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the weakness of the French, and the administration of that shock which Napoleon\u2019s army had only awaited to begin its flight. CHAPTER VIII Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon\u2019s hands. The Russian army, only half the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month. Napoleon\u2019s position is most brilliant. He can either fall on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to Smol\u00e9nsk or V\u00edlna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time.", " But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now\u2014with the fight balanced on such a strained center\u2014destroy him and his army. When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon, or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the Russians still holding their ground\u2014a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing, might break through his center, he himself might be killed by a stray cannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him, and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness. The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French army aroused that horror in Napoleon.", " Now there is nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not and never will know it. And now it will never, never be possible to put it right.\u201d And now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her, only in her imagination Nat\u00e1sha this time gave him a different answer. She stopped him and said: \u201cTerrible for you, but not for me! You know that for me there is nothing in life but you, and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me,\u201d and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death. And in her imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now: \u201cI love thee!... thee! I love, love...\u201d she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate effort.... She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this. Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears. Duny\u00e1sha, her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.", " It did not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things were no business of his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so. \u201cRussia and summer weather are not bound together,\u201d he thought, repeating words of Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s which he found strangely consoling. His intention of killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that their prisoner\u2019s name was Count Bez\u00fakhov? He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew\u2019s thoughts somewhat differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering, the satisfaction of one\u2019s needs and consequent freedom in the choice of one\u2019s occupation, that is, of one\u2019s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be indubitably man\u2019s highest happiness."], "When Andrew visits Bald Hills, he admits his unhappiness about what or whom?": [" After the return of Alp\u00e1tych from Smol\u00e9nsk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief\u2019s discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia\u2019s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills. But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguch\u00e1rovo and thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her father\u2019s feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him. She refused to go away and her father\u2019s fury broke over her in a terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her.", " The angel\u2019s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angel\u2019s face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel\u2019s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: \u201cAh, why have you done this to me?\u201d Soon after Prince Andrew\u2019s return the old prince made over to him a large estate, Boguch\u00e1rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father\u2019s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Boguch\u00e1rovo, began building and spent most of his time there. After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man, roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.", " \u201cThe French at V\u00edtebsk, in four days\u2019 march they may be at Smol\u00e9nsk; perhaps are already there! T\u00edkhon!\u201d T\u00edkhon jumped up. \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want anything!\u201d he shouted. He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face, vigorous and alert, entering Pot\u00ebmkin\u2019s gaily colored tent, and a burning sense of jealousy of \u201cthe favorite\u201d agitated him now as strongly as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with Pot\u00ebmkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Z\u00fabov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand. \u201cOh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all the present! Quicker, quicker\u2014and that they should leave me in peace!\u201d CHAPTER IV Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s estate, lay forty miles east from Smol\u00e9nsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow. The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alp\u00e1tych, Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety, though from Prince Andrew\u2019s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alp\u00e1tych to the Provincial Governor at Smol\u00e9nsk, asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed.", " Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair. In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smol\u00e9nsk on the sixth of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled. But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously he had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there. He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the march, rode to his father\u2019s estate where he had been born and spent his childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper\u2019s lodge."], "In Austria, General Kutuzov expresses disappointment regarding which of the following?": [" If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man\u2019s in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity. If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot exist, for then man\u2019s will is subject to that law. In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance. The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view\u2014theological, historical, ethical, or philosophic\u2014we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free. This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only through consciousness does he know himself. Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable. To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of his volition.", " Though they had not been summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt that this was really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform.", " Prince Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski came into the room with the required papers. Kut\u00fazov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out. \u201cAh!...\u201d said Kut\u00fazov glancing at Bolk\u00f3nski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the conversation in French. \u201cAll I can say, General,\u201d said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kut\u00fazov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice. \u201cAll I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general\u2014of whom Austria has so many\u2014and to lay down all this heavy responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us, General.\u201d And Kut\u00fazov smiled in a way that seemed to say, \u201cYou are quite at liberty not to believe me and I don\u2019t even care whether you do or not, but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole point.\u201d The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in the same tone. \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, \u201con the contrary, your excellency\u2019s participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles,\u201d he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence.", " He turned to look at Kut\u00fazov and his suite, to compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the same feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with Prince Andrew. \u201cGo, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!\u201d Kut\u00fazov was saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the battlefield. Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down the knoll. \u201cTo the crossing!\u201d said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going. \u201cI\u2019ll go there too, I too!\u201d thought Pierre, and followed the general. The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest, clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll. CHAPTER XXXI Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him."], "When he brings news about a Russian victory to the Austrian Ministry of War, Andrew is surprised by which of the following?": [" Kut\u00fazov bowed with the same smile. \u201cBut that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov. The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kut\u00fazov\u2019s suggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony. But Kut\u00fazov went on blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack\u2019s army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable. \u201cGive me that letter,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov turning to Prince Andrew. \u201cPlease have a look at it\u201d\u2014and Kut\u00fazov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand\u2019s letter: We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally.", " His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark of the commander in chief\u2019s special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Br\u00fcnn. Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokht\u00farov to Kut\u00fazov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Br\u00fcnn. To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion. The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day\u2014the day of the battle. Reviewing his impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away.", " \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored. \u201cBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country\u2019s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone.", " His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another. \u201cFrom General Field Marshal Kut\u00fazov?\u201d he asked. \u201cI hope it is good news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was high time!\u201d He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression. \u201cOh, my God! My God! Schmidt!\u201d he exclaimed in German. \u201cWhat a calamity! What a calamity!\u201d Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something. \u201cAh what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is not captured.\u201d Again he pondered. \u201cI am very glad you have brought good news, though Schmidt\u2019s death is a heavy price to pay for the victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade. However, I will let you know.\u201d The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking, reappeared. \u201cAu revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to see you,\u201d he added, bowing his head. When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past."], "When Nicholas is wounded and sees the approaching enemy, he is surprised by what thought?": [" And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question Pierre. The questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles. But Nat\u00e1sha, knowing all her husband\u2019s ways and ideas, saw that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince Theodore had gone. \u201cWhat was it about?\u201d asked Nicholas. \u201cAlways the same thing,\u201d said Pierre, looking round at his listeners. \u201cEverybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they can.\u201d \u201cWhat can decent men do?\u201d Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. \u201cWhat can be done?\u201d \u201cWhy, this...\u201d \u201cCome into my study,\u201d said Nicholas. Nat\u00e1sha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window. \u201cWell, what would you do?\u201d asked Den\u00edsov. \u201cAlways some fantastic schemes,\u201d said Nicholas.", " As they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As \u2018twas growing dark last night\u2014the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught. \u201cGot it?\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cWhat were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?\u201d inquired Nat\u00e1sha. They were fond of asking one another that question. \u201cI?\u201d said Nicholas, trying to remember. \u201cWell, you see, first I thought that Rug\u00e1y, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then for his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don\u2019t you think so?... Well, and you?\u201d \u201cI? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in Otr\u00e1dnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I thought... No, nothing else.\u201d \u201cI know, I expect you thought of him,\u201d said Nicholas, smiling as Nat\u00e1sha knew by the sound of his voice. \u201cNo,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, though she had in reality been thinking about Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would have liked \u201cUncle.\u201d \u201cAnd then I was saying to myself all the way, \u2018How well An\u00edsya carried herself, how well!\u2019\u201d And Nicholas heard her spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. \u201cAnd do you know,\u201d she suddenly said, \u201cI know that I shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now.\u201d \u201cRubbish, nonsense, humbug!\u201d exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought: \u201cHow charming this Nat\u00e1sha of mine is!", " His particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces. All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials. With the na\u00efve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men\u2019s wives were created for them, Rost\u00f3v did not leave the lady\u2019s side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if, without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rost\u00f3v. But the latter\u2019s good-natured na\u00efvet\u00e9 was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas\u2019 good humor. Toward the end of the evening, however, as the wife\u2019s face grew more flushed and animated, the husband\u2019s became more and more melancholy and solemn, as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife\u2019s share increased the husband\u2019s diminished. CHAPTER V Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face.", " His face grew more and more animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer\u2014all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs. Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity, T\u00fashin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness. From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and thud of the enemy\u2019s cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy\u2019s side (always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure."], "Once he becomes Count Bezukhov, Pierre discovers what?": [" Pierre\u2014only now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew\u2014promised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room. \u201cMind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And stay to dinner if you care to!\u201d she called after Pierre. Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning Nat\u00e1sha had told him that she had rejected Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cTroubles, troubles, my dear fellow!\u201d he said to Pierre. \u201cWhat troubles one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody? It\u2019s true this engagement never was much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but still, with his father\u2019s disapproval they wouldn\u2019t have been happy, and Nat\u00e1sha won\u2019t lack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and to take such a step without father\u2019s or mother\u2019s consent! And now she\u2019s ill, and God knows what! It\u2019s hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in their mother\u2019s absence....\u201d Pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject, but the count returned to his troubles. S\u00f3nya entered the room with an agitated face. \u201cNat\u00e1sha is not quite well; she\u2019s in her room and would like to see you.", " It is becoming dangerous to speak French in the streets.\u201d \u201cAnd how about you, Count Peter Kir\u00edlych? If they call up the militia, you too will have to mount a horse,\u201d remarked the old count, addressing Pierre. Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not to grasp what was said. He looked at the count. \u201cOh yes, the war,\u201d he said. \u201cNo! What sort of warrior should I make? And yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can\u2019t make it out. I don\u2019t know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no one can answer for himself.\u201d After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and with a serious face asked S\u00f3nya, who was considered an excellent reader, to read the appeal. \u201cTo Moscow, our ancient Capital! \u201cThe enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He comes to despoil our beloved country.\u201d S\u00f3nya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages. Nat\u00e1sha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at Pierre. Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinsh\u00edn, with a sarcastic smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity: S\u00f3nya\u2019s reading, any remark of the count\u2019s, or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.", " He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where Pierre\u2019s face had been before he sat down. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count\u2019s face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna looked attentively at the sick man\u2019s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vas\u00edli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed. \u201cWants to turn on the other side,\u201d whispered the servant, and got up to turn the count\u2019s heavy body toward the wall. Pierre rose to help him. While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre\u2019s terror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness.", " \u201cBor\u00eds,\u201d she said to her son with a smile, \u201cI shall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and don\u2019t forget to give him the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 invitation. They ask him to dinner. I suppose he won\u2019t go?\u201d she continued, turning to the prince. \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed, \u201cI shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Bor\u00eds down one flight of stairs and up another, to Pierre\u2019s rooms. CHAPTER XVI Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rost\u00f3v\u2019s was true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father\u2019s house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father\u2014who were never favorably disposed toward him\u2014would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father\u2019s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud."], "Nicholas feels a desire to die for ___.": [" Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled. But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does not and cannot believe this. However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would be unable to live for a single moment. He could not live, because all man\u2019s efforts, all his impulses to life, are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger, virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.", " The first death I saw, and one I shall never forget\u2014that of my dear sister-in-law\u2014left that impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though generally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother\u2019s duties. As a young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not a single hair of our heads will fall without His will.", " \u201cI will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petr\u00f3vna speaks of Lily, but I say, no\u2014the princess! Do you want me to do it? I am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl she is, really! And she is not at all so plain, either.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. \u201cAs befits a soldier, Aunt, I don\u2019t force myself on anyone or refuse anything,\u201d he said before he had time to consider what he was saying. \u201cWell then, remember, this is not a joke!\u201d \u201cOf course not!\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d the governor\u2019s wife said as if talking to herself. \u201cBut, my dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....\u201d \u201cOh no, we are good friends with him,\u201d said Nicholas in the simplicity of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else. \u201cBut what nonsense I have been saying to the governor\u2019s wife!\u201d thought Nicholas suddenly at supper. \u201cShe will really begin to arrange a match... and S\u00f3nya...?\u201d And on taking leave of the governor\u2019s wife, when she again smilingly said to him, \u201cWell then, remember!\u201d he drew her aside. \u201cBut see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...\u201d \u201cWhat is it, my dear? Come, let\u2019s sit down here,\u201d said she. Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger.", " Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition. Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the officers\u2019 saying that it was humiliating to look at the French, Rost\u00f3v began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the officers: \u201cHow can you judge what\u2019s best?\u201d he cried, the blood suddenly rushing to his face. \u201cHow can you judge the Emperor\u2019s actions? What right have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor\u2019s aims or his actions!\u201d \u201cBut I never said a word about the Emperor!\u201d said the officer, justifying himself, and unable to understand Rost\u00f3v\u2019s outburst, except on the supposition that he was drunk. But Rost\u00f3v did not listen to him. \u201cWe are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,\u201d he went on. \u201cIf we are ordered to die, we must die. If we\u2019re punished, it means that we have deserved it, it\u2019s not for us to judge."], "The Muscovite society assumes that who has died?": [" And that fear was the fear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in. Something not human\u2014death\u2014was breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it back\u2014to lock it was no longer possible\u2014but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and closed again. Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died. But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke. \u201cYes, it was death! I died\u2014and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!\u201d And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that strange lightness did not again leave him. When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, Nat\u00e1sha went up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at her strangely, not understanding. That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary\u2019s arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest Nat\u00e1sha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing.", " To all questions put to him\u2014whether important or quite trifling\u2014such as: Where would he live? Was he going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for someone?\u2014he replied: \u201cYes, perhaps,\u201d or, \u201cI think so,\u201d and so on. He had heard that the Rost\u00f3vs were at Kostrom\u00e1 but the thought of Nat\u00e1sha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had aroused in himself. On the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetsk\u00f3ys that Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre\u2019s thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary was in Moscow and living in her house\u2014which had not been burned\u2014in Vozdv\u00edzhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her. On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last one at Borodin\u00f3. \u201cIs it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in? Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?\u201d thought Pierre. He recalled Karat\u00e1ev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them.", " Everybody knew him, the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. That day everyone met with the words: \u201cWhat a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss Kut\u00e1ysov is! How sorry I am!\u201d \u201cWhat did I tell about Kut\u00fazov?\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli now said with a prophet\u2019s pride. \u201cI always said he was the only man capable of defeating Napoleon.\u201d But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the Emperor. \u201cFancy the Emperor\u2019s position!\u201d said they, and instead of extolling Kut\u00fazov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause of the Emperor\u2019s anxiety. That day Prince Vas\u00edli no longer boasted of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Kut\u00fazov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was added. Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bez\u00fakhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone said that Countess Bez\u00fakhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect; but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her.", " They, in Pierre\u2019s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else. \u201cTo be a soldier, just a soldier!\u201d thought Pierre as he fell asleep, \u201cto enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what they are. But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with D\u00f3lokhov.\u201d And the memory of the dinner at the English Club when he had challenged D\u00f3lokhov flashed through Pierre\u2019s mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzh\u00f3k. And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind. It was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table. \u201cYes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cYes, he died, and I did not know he was alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive again!\u201d On one side of the table sat Anatole, D\u00f3lokhov, Nesv\u00edtski, Den\u00edsov, and others like them (in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed they), and he heard those people, Anatole and D\u00f3lokhov, shouting and singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but pleasant and comforting."], "Who does Pierre duel?": [" If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostrom\u00e1 used to tell me. \u2018Everyone fears a bear,\u2019 he says, \u2018but when you see one your fear\u2019s all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!\u2019 And that\u2019s how it is with me. \u00c0 demain, mon cher.\u201d * * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow. Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesv\u00edtski drove to the Sok\u00f3lniki forest and found D\u00f3lokhov, Den\u00edsov, and Rost\u00f3v already there. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow. He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed by two considerations: his wife\u2019s guilt, of which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of D\u00f3lokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him.... \u201cI should perhaps have done the same thing in his place,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cIt\u2019s even certain that I should have done the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee.", " \u201cWell, what\u2019s this now? What have you been up to now, I should like to know?\u201d she asked sternly. \u201cI? What have I...?\u201d stammered Pierre. \u201cSo it seems you\u2019re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about? What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.\u201d Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but could not reply. \u201cIf you won\u2019t answer, I\u2019ll tell you...\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne went on. \u201cYou believe everything you\u2019re told. You were told...\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne laughed, \u201cthat D\u00f3lokhov was my lover,\u201d she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other word, \u201cand you believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this duel prove? That you\u2019re a fool, que vous \u00eates un sot, but everybody knew that. What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause.\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne raised her voice and became more and more excited, \u201cA man who\u2019s a better man than you in every way...\u201d \u201cHm... Hm...!\u201d growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and not moving a muscle. \u201cAnd how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer yours.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me... I beg you,\u201d muttered Pierre hoarsely. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,\u201d said she.", " \u201cNow, dear boy,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli playfully, \u201csay \u2018yes,\u2019 and I\u2019ll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.\u201d But before Prince Vas\u00edli had finished his playful speech, Pierre, without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his father, muttered in a whisper: \u201cPrince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!\u201d And he jumped up and opened the door for him. \u201cGo!\u201d he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Are you ill?\u201d \u201cGo!\u201d the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vas\u00edli had to go without receiving any explanation. A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons, and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity. CHAPTER VI The duel between Pierre and D\u00f3lokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the Emperor\u2019s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierre\u2019s rupture with his wife, was the talk of society. Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage\u2014when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from him\u2014especially as he did not know how, and did not wish, to court society\u2019s favor.", " He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home. Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\u00f3lokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see Nat\u00e1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\u2019s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The countess\u2019 drawing room was full of guests. Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return\u2014at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever\u2014entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him. \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room. \u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room."], "What happens immediately after Andrew returns home?": [" \u201cDo you know?\u201d said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought, \u201cseriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I can\u2019t decide or think properly about anything. One\u2019s head aches, and one spends all one\u2019s money. He asked me for tonight, but I won\u2019t go.\u201d \u201cYou give me your word of honor not to go?\u201d \u201cOn my honor!\u201d CHAPTER IX It was past one o\u2019clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kur\u00e1gin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of. \u201cI should like to go to Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s,\u201d thought he. But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; \u201cbesides,\u201d thought he, \u201call such \u2018words of honor\u2019 are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!\u201d Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions.", " \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped! It happens to everyone!\u201d said the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father\u2019s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone! The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\u2019s words and began bustlingly searching for something. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he muttered, \u201cit will be difficult, I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\u201d And with a furtive glance at his son\u2019s face, the count went out of the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all expected this. \u201cPapa! Pa-pa!\u201d he called after him, sobbing, \u201cforgive me!\u201d And seizing his father\u2019s hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears. While father and son were having their explanation, the mother and daughter were having one not less important. Nat\u00e1sha came running to her mother, quite excited. \u201cMamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...\u201d \u201cMade what?\u201d \u201cMade, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!\u201d she exclaimed. The countess did not believe her ears. Den\u00edsov had proposed. To whom? To this chit of a girl, Nat\u00e1sha, who not so long ago was playing with dolls and who was still having lessons. \u201cDon\u2019t, Nat\u00e1sha! What nonsense!\u201d she said, hoping it was a joke. \u201cNonsense, indeed!", " And during the two days of the young man\u2019s visit he was extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again. When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but what was good of him. CHAPTER XV When returning from his leave, Rost\u00f3v felt, for the first time, how close was the bond that united him to Den\u00edsov and the whole regiment. On approaching it, Rost\u00f3v felt as he had done when approaching his home in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Dem\u00e9ntyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavr\u00fashka gleefully shouted to his master, \u201cThe count has come!\u201d and Den\u00edsov, who had been asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rost\u00f3v experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents\u2019 house. When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own place, as he had felt under the parental roof.", " And it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram, who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats\u2014that this very ram, swelling with fat, is killed for meat. But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken, and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened, they will at least know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally, and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius. Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce (incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then the words chance and genius become superfluous. We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European convulsions and that we know only the facts\u2014that is, the murders, first in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain, and in Russia\u2014and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable."], "When he travels to St. Petersburg, Pierre renounces what?": [" The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend\u2019s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew\u2019s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He checked himself, fearing to seem na\u00efve, yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly know myself again.\u201d \u201cYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cWell, and you? What are your plans?\u201d \u201cPlans!\u201d repeated Prince Andrew ironically. \u201cMy plans?\u201d he said, as if astonished at the word. \u201cWell, you see, I\u2019m building. I mean to settle here altogether next year....\u201d Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew\u2019s face, which had grown much older. \u201cNo, I meant to ask...\u201d Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates.\u201d Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made.", " Though Nicholas Rost\u00f3v had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little, the way of life at Otr\u00e1dnoe\u2014M\u00edtenka\u2019s management of affairs, in particular\u2014was such that the debts inevitably increased every year. The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time. Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to V\u00e9ra and was accepted. Though in Moscow the Rost\u00f3vs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them. The Rost\u00f3vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country neighbors from Otr\u00e1dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Per\u00f3nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bez\u00fakhov, and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house in Petersburg were Bor\u00eds, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and paid the eldest daughter, Countess V\u00e9ra, the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose.", " Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre\u2019s presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had said. Pierre\u2019s past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Nat\u00e1sha (of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierre\u2019s friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember\u2014all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint. From broken remarks about Nat\u00e1sha and his father, from the emotion with which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent tenderness with which Nat\u00e1sha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had loved Nat\u00e1sha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture.", " \u201cYes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike him\u2014in everything.\u201d \u201cYes, but he\u2019s wonderful.\u201d \u201cWell, good night,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there. CHAPTER XVIII It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now smiling happily. He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Nat\u00e1sha, and of their love, at one moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling. It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room. \u201cWell, what\u2019s to be done if it cannot be avoided? What\u2019s to be done? Evidently it has to be so,\u201d said he to himself, and hastily undressing he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision. \u201cStrange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything that she and I may be man and wife,\u201d he told himself. A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Sav\u00e9lich came to ask him about packing for the journey. \u201cWhat, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?\u201d he asked involuntarily, though only to himself."], "Why does Andrew refuse to go on a military mission?": [" All the kings, except the Chinese, wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards. \u201cThey meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear them?\u201d exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. \u201cAh, my friend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have begun to understand too much. And it doesn\u2019t do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, it\u2019s not for long!\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, you\u2019re sleepy, and it\u2019s time for me to sleep. Go back to G\u00f3rki!\u201d said Prince Andrew suddenly. \u201cOh no!\u201d Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened, compassionate eyes. \u201cGo, go! Before a battle one must have one\u2019s sleep out,\u201d repeated Prince Andrew. He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. \u201cGood-by, be off!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhether we meet again or not...\u201d and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed. It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the expression of Prince Andrew\u2019s face was angry or tender. For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away.", " Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk regiment had stood in front of the house to which Balash\u00ebv was conducted, and now two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balash\u00ebv in the very house in V\u00edlna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission. CHAPTER VI Though Balash\u00ebv was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of Napoleon\u2019s court. The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates\u2014several of whom Balash\u00ebv had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia\u2014were waiting. Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going for his ride. After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balash\u00ebv to follow him. Balash\u00ebv went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps, firm and resolute\u2014they were those of Napoleon.", " \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored. \u201cBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country\u2019s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone.", " Guerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes that rule. This contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military science says that the more troops the greater the strength. Les gros bataillons ont toujours raison. * * Large battalions are always victorious. For military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal. Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity. In military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and some unknown x. Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it\u2014now in a geometric formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the genius of the commanders. But the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts. Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify the \u201cheroes\u201d) of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity."], "In 1809, Russia becomes allies with whom?": [" In Russia there was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleon\u2019s allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand. Then Louis XVIII, who till then had been the laughingstock both of the French and the Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears before his Old Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon arrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating him, immediately all submitted to him.", " \u201cBut what do I care about your allies?\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cI have allies\u2014the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.\u201d And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood, and that Balash\u00ebv still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned round, drew close to Balash\u00ebv\u2019s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands, almost shouted: \u201cKnow that if you stir up Prussia against me, I\u2019ll wipe it off the map of Europe!\u201d he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. \u201cYes, I will throw you back beyond the Dv\u00edna and beyond the Dnieper, and will re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you. That is what you have gained by alienating me!\u201d And he walked silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching. He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balash\u00ebv. He paused, looked ironically straight into Balash\u00ebv\u2019s eyes, and said in a quiet voice: \u201cAnd yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!\u201d Balash\u00ebv, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light.", " Attempted drives from east to west\u2014similar to the contrary movements of 1805, 1807, and 1809\u2014precede the great westward movement; there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation midway, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached. Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his craft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later\u2014an outlawed brigand. But by some strange chance no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days\u2019 sail from France, which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him. CHAPTER IV The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have caused the floods to abate.", " Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless. The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of Matr\u00ebshka the vivandi\u00e8re, and like matters. As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rost\u00f3v took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually, without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the state of Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to think about it, that Kut\u00fazov and others were there for that purpose, but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years\u2019 time."], "In St. Petersburg, Andrew becomes involved in which of the following?": [" Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity student, who now, Bolk\u00f3nski thought, held in his hands\u2014those plump white hands\u2014the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Sper\u00e1nski answered the old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud, Sper\u00e1nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign. Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Sper\u00e1nski rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cI had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,\u201d he said with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. \u201cI have known of you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much gossip and tittle-tattle.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cmy father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege.", " Though Nicholas Rost\u00f3v had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little, the way of life at Otr\u00e1dnoe\u2014M\u00edtenka\u2019s management of affairs, in particular\u2014was such that the debts inevitably increased every year. The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time. Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to V\u00e9ra and was accepted. Though in Moscow the Rost\u00f3vs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them. The Rost\u00f3vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country neighbors from Otr\u00e1dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Per\u00f3nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bez\u00fakhov, and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house in Petersburg were Bor\u00eds, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and paid the eldest daughter, Countess V\u00e9ra, the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose.", " \u201cIf she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be my wife,\u201d said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as he watched her. She did go first to her cousin. \u201cWhat rubbish sometimes enters one\u2019s head!\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cbut what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original, that she won\u2019t be dancing here a month before she will be married.... Such as she are rare here,\u201d he thought, as Nat\u00e1sha, readjusting a rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him. When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Nat\u00e1sha did not answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: \u201cHow can you ask such a question?\u201d \u201cI have never enjoyed myself so much before!\u201d she said, and Prince Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father and instantly dropped again. Nat\u00e1sha was happier than she had ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of evil, unhappiness, or sorrow. At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one.", " She told of an accident they had had on the Sp\u00e1sski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Od\u00fdntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law\u2019s words. In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother: \u201cSo you are really going to the war, Andrew?\u201d she said sighing. Lise sighed too. \u201cYes, and even tomorrow,\u201d replied her brother. \u201cHe is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had promotion...\u201d Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure. \u201cIs it certain?\u201d she said. The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: \u201cYes, quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...\u201d Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law\u2019s and unexpectedly again began to cry. \u201cShe needs rest,\u201d said Prince Andrew with a frown. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Lise? Take her to your room and I\u2019ll go to Father."], "Pierre reconciles with whom?": [" Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre\u2019s presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had said. Pierre\u2019s past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Nat\u00e1sha (of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierre\u2019s friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember\u2014all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint. From broken remarks about Nat\u00e1sha and his father, from the emotion with which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent tenderness with which Nat\u00e1sha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had loved Nat\u00e1sha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture.", " Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him. \u201cLieutenant, he has a dagger,\u201d were the first words Pierre understood. \u201cAh, a weapon?\u201d said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with Pierre. \u201cAll right, you can tell all about it at the court-martial.\u201d Then he turned to Pierre. \u201cDo you speak French?\u201d Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of Pierre. \u201cDo you speak French?\u201d the officer asked again, keeping at a distance from Pierre. \u201cCall the interpreter.\u201d A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops. \u201cHe does not look like a common man,\u201d said the interpreter, after a searching look at Pierre. \u201cAh, he looks very much like an incendiary,\u201d remarked the officer.", " Karat\u00e1ev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away. When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. Karat\u00e1ev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again but went limping up the hill. From behind, where Karat\u00e1ev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot. Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to Smol\u00e9nsk\u2014a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And he again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and in the expression on their faces\u2014one of them glanced timidly at Pierre\u2014there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him. Behind him, where Karat\u00e1ev had been sitting, the dog began to howl. \u201cWhat a stupid beast! Why is it howling?\u201d thought Pierre. His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling, just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces.", " Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet steps. \u201cPierre!\u201d she said. Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said: \u201cHe is no more....\u201d Pierre looked at her over his spectacles. \u201cCome, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears.\u201d She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna left him, and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm. In the morning Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna said to Pierre: \u201cYes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.\u201d Pierre was silent. \u201cPerhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Bor\u00eds. But he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father\u2019s wish?\u201d Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna returned to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and went to bed."], "Pierre notices how Natasha brightens when she speaks to ___.": [" There, there, I tell you,\u201d and the count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread them in his study before having a nap. \u201cWell, Peter Kir\u00edlych, let\u2019s go and have a smoke,\u201d he said. Pierre was agitated and undecided. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s unwontedly brilliant eyes, continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced him to this condition. \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll go home.\u201d \u201cHome? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don\u2019t often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,\u201d said the count good-naturedly, pointing to Nat\u00e1sha, \u201conly brightens up when you\u2019re here.\u201d \u201cYes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...\u201d said Pierre hurriedly. \u201cWell, then, au revoir!\u201d said the count, and went out of the room. \u201cWhy are you going? Why are you upset?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha, and she looked challengingly into Pierre\u2019s eyes. \u201cBecause I love you!\u201d was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it, and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes. \u201cBecause it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply I have business....\u201d \u201cWhy? No, tell me!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha began resolutely and suddenly stopped. They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently kissed her hand and went out. Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 any more. CHAPTER XXI After the definite refusal he had received, P\u00e9tya went to his room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly.", " Speak to the captain when he makes his round, he will do anything for you.\u201d (The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre and showed him all sorts of favors.) \u201c\u2018You see, St. Thomas,\u2019 he said to me the other day. \u2018Monsieur Kiril is a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what\u2019s what.... If he wants anything and asks me, he won\u2019t get a refusal. When one has studied, you see, one likes education and well-bred people.\u2019 It is for your sake I mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill.\u201d And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before\u2014a fight between the prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said. While Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that shed. A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them, which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts for them.", " And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna P\u00e1vlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abb\u00e9. Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.", " I too am a man like the rest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God.\u201d As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to comprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man. A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey. Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the bee\u2019s existence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the bee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first, the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes, the more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension."], "What causes Nicholas to take a military leave and to return home?": [" For a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Nat\u00e1sha before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations about S\u00f3nya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a letter from his mother, written without his father\u2019s knowledge, and that letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted M\u00edtenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family wretched,\u201d wrote the countess. This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do. The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavr\u00fashka (Den\u00edsov\u2019s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going home.", " Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows. The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power\u2014the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and guns\u2014should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes.", " We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smol\u00e9nsk and Moscow and were killed by them. To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war.", " Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it\u2014far stronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance. At the last post station before Otr\u00e1dnoe he gave the driver a three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home. After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied expectation\u2014the feeling that \u201ceverything is just the same, so why did I hurry?\u201d\u2014Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world. His father and mother were much the same, only a little older. What was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the bad state of their affairs. S\u00f3nya was nearly twenty; she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already, but that was enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas returned, and the faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him. P\u00e9tya and Nat\u00e1sha surprised Nicholas most. P\u00e9tya was a big handsome boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking. As for Nat\u00e1sha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not the same at all,\u201d he said. \u201cHow? Am I uglier?\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, but what dignity?"], "In Moscow, Prince Bolkonski expresses ___ sentiments.": [" Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers. The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smol\u00e9nsk, without the participation of Count Rostopch\u00edn and his broadsheets. The people awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property, while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left. The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one\u2019s children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results. \u201cIt is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running away from Moscow,\u201d they were told.", " One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification. All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity. On what, then, was Count Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s fear for the tranquillity of Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to riot? Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of September, and except for a mob in the governor\u2019s courtyard, assembled there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of Borodin\u00f3, when the surrender of Moscow became certain or at least probable, Rostopch\u00edn instead of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned. Rostopch\u00edn, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding.", " He is a man who has been more than a father to me!\u201d The prince was about to say something, but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne interrupted him. \u201cWell, yes,\u201d said she, \u201cit may be that he has other sentiments for me than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude!

What have they been invented for if they can\u2019t arrange that?\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him, and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the Society of Jesus, with whom he was on intimate terms.", " \u201cDevil take it!\u201d said the voice of a man stumbling over something. Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way.

What a surprise!\u201d said he. \u201cWhat brings you here? This is unexpected!\u201d As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness\u2014they expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew\u2019s face he felt constrained and ill at ease. \u201cI have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,\u201d said Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word \u201cinteresting.\u201d \u201cI wish to see the battle.\u201d \u201cOh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war?

Reasons were found for the incredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat, everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things began to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a defective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebysz\u00e9wski and of the Frenchman Langeron, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s incapacity, and (it was whispered) the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless and insignificant people. But the army, the Russian army, everyone declared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor. The soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, distinguished by his Sch\u00f6n Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own. What also conduced to Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s being selected as Moscow\u2019s hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suv\u00f3rov. Moreover, paying such honor to Bagrati\u00f3n was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of Kut\u00fazov.", " In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand rubles\u2014to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts.

When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself, Nicholas arrived at the governor\u2019s rather late, but with the phrase \u201cbetter late than never\u201d on his lips. It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew that Catherine Petr\u00f3vna would play valses and the \u00e9cossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as to a ball. Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an \u201cin for a penny, in for a pound\u2014who cares?\u201d spirit, and the inevitable small talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances, now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.

It is impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break the silence, looked at Nat\u00e1sha and at Princess Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy. \u201cDo you take vodka, Count?\u201d asked Princess Mary, and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past. \u201cNow tell us about yourself,\u201d said she. \u201cOne hears such improbable wonders about you.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him. \u201cThey even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of!

I experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel that bliss. To love one\u2019s neighbors, to love one\u2019s enemies, to love everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man.

To the third party\u2014in which the Emperor had most confidence\u2014belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakch\u00e9ev belonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now), needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel\u2019s opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel\u2019s plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party.", " A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct. All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity of race among these people\u2014this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these drones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly. From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.", " Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every day\u2014especially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own\u2014there were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals were there. Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant, and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of tendencies and parties: The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents\u2014military theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws\u2014laws of oblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism, ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans. The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from V\u00edlna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagrati\u00f3n, Erm\u00f3lov (who was beginning to come to the front), and others."], "Which of the following helps Natasha heal after her illness?": [" During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes, and Nat\u00e1sha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes, but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly. \u201cHow glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won\u2019t you have some tea?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha went up to her. \u201cYou have improved in looks and grown more manly,\u201d continued the countess, taking her daughter\u2019s hand. \u201cMamma! What are you saying...\u201d \u201cNat\u00e1sha, he is no more, no more!\u201d And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first time. CHAPTER III Princess Mary postponed her departure. S\u00f3nya and the count tried to replace Nat\u00e1sha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks Nat\u00e1sha remained constantly at her mother\u2019s side, sleeping on a lounge chair in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her mother. The mother\u2019s wounded spirit could not heal. P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had torn from her half her life. When the news of P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Nat\u00e1sha to life. A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.", " \u201cSo that\u2019s all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my country\u2019s sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes? And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. George\u2019s Cross.... I can\u2019t make it out at all.\u201d But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at Ostr\u00f3vna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen. CHAPTER XVI On receiving news of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s illness, the countess, though not quite well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with P\u00e9tya and the rest of the household, and the whole family moved from M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s house to their own and settled down in town. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness, her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help her.", " The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bez\u00fakhova. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed several gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way. They all knew very well that the enchanting countess\u2019 illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time, and that the Italian\u2019s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience; but in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it. \u201cThey say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina pectoris.\u201d \u201cAngina? Oh, that\u2019s a terrible illness!\u201d \u201cThey say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...\u201d and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction. \u201cThe count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous.\u201d \u201cOh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.\u201d \u201cYou are speaking of the poor countess?\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, coming up just then. \u201cI sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the world,\u201d she went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. \u201cWe belong to different camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves.", " On the day of his rescue he had seen the body of P\u00e9tya Rost\u00f3v. That same day he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of Borodin\u00f3 for more than a month had recently died in the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house at Yarosl\u00e1vl, and Den\u00edsov who told him this news also mentioned H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s death, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another, to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Or\u00ebl he immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him two of his servants, Ter\u00e9nty and V\u00e1ska, who had come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been living on his estate at El\u00e9ts and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him. It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity."], "As the section opens, the narrator continues to express disagreement with which of the following?": [" The French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold. But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was Napoleon\u2019s attempt to stop the looting and re-establish discipline. This is what the army authorities were reporting: \u201cLooting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen goods.\u201d \u201cThe neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly witnessed.\u201d \u201cNothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging\u2014October 9.\u201d \u201cRobbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force\u2014October 11.\u201d \u201cThe Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning to the Kr\u00e9mlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today.", " \u201cBut nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out.\u201d A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army Regulations and\u2014what he had not at all expected\u2014was chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up and, with the aid of the Code Napol\u00e9on and the Institutes of Justinian, he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights. CHAPTER VII Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms, in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular. He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in Petersburg. His life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved. Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him.", " An infantry regiment which had left Tar\u00fatino three thousand strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place\u2014a village on the highroad. The quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff. There was only one hut available for the regimental commander. The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts. Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches, and merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the campfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter. Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed. \u201cNow then, all together\u2014shove!\u201d cried the voices, and the huge surface of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen swaying in the gloom of the night.", " A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file; the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which will represent the commander in chief. The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking, burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions from men above him; he himself never gives an order. The noncommissioned officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An officer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more frequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity\u2014in agriculture, trade, and every administration. And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action, combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are, while the less their direct participation in the action itself, the more they command and the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top, who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding."], "Mary and her father disagree about what?": [" Thanks to Den\u00edsov the conversation at table soon became general and lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her. \u201cYou always have such strange fancies! I didn\u2019t even think of being angry,\u201d he replied. But the word always seemed to her to imply: \u201cYes, I am angry but I won\u2019t tell you why.\u201d Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even S\u00f3nya and the old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree, could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they had been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary\u2019s pregnancies, and this was such a time. \u201cWell, messieurs et mesdames,\u201d said Nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to vex her), \u201cI have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I shall have to suffer, so today I\u2019ll go and rest.\u201d And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa. \u201cThat\u2019s always the way,\u201d thought Countess Mary. \u201cHe talks to everyone except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I am in this condition.\u201d She looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever.", " \u201cNo? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she\u2019s much to be pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don\u2019t need her, and she\u2019s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Iv\u00e1novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: \u2018We don\u2019t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.\u2019 Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.\u201d \u201cTo be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father\u2019s character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Prince Andrew asked suddenly. Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question. \u201cFor me? For me?... Trying for me!...\u201d said she. \u201cHe always was rather harsh; and now I should think he\u2019s getting very trying,\u201d said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister. \u201cYou are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride,\u201d said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke?", " Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him. When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry. He looked at her attentively. \u201cIs it about Nicholas?\u201d he asked. Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping. \u201cMary, you know the Gosp...\u201d but he broke off. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u201cNothing. You mustn\u2019t cry here,\u201d he said, looking at her with the same cold expression. When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view. \u201cYes, to them it must seem sad!\u201d he thought. \u201cBut how simple it is. \u201cThe fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father feedeth them,\u201d he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary; \u201cbut no, they will take it their own way, they won\u2019t understand! They can\u2019t understand that all those feelings they prize so\u2014all our feelings, all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot understand one another,\u201d and he remained silent. Prince Andrew\u2019s little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge, observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father, Mary, and Nat\u00e1sha, than he had then.", " Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life\u2014love\u2014was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life. Prince Andrew\u2019s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat\u00e1sha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother\u2019s bedroom had strained Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s physical strength. One afternoon noticing Nat\u00e1sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Nat\u00e1sha lay down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\u201d \u201cYou are tired\u2014try to sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\u201d \u201cShe is much better. She spoke so well today,\u201d said Princess Mary. Nat\u00e1sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned Princess Mary\u2019s face. \u201cIs she like him?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYes, like and yet not like. But she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\u2019s hand to herself, \u201cMary, you mustn\u2019t think me wicked."], "In describing Napoleon\u2019s advance toward Moscow, the narrator expresses disagreement with what aspect of historical reports?": [" Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel\u2019s plan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smol\u00e9nsk, still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smol\u00e9nsk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls. So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country. Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at Smol\u00e9nsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him. The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan, for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one way of saving Russia.", " From Vy\u00e1zma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow. Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacr\u00e9e des peuples d\u2019Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables \u00e9glises en forme de pagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleon\u2019s imagination no rest. On the march from Vy\u00e1zma to Ts\u00e1revo-Zaym\u00edshche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages, and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by Lelorgne d\u2019Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression. * \u201cMoscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the sacred city of Alexander\u2019s people, Moscow with its innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d asked Napoleon. \u201cOne of Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s Cossacks says that Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s corps is joining up with the main army and that Kut\u00fazov has been appointed commander in chief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.\u201d Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavr\u00fashka, the serf Den\u00edsov had handed over to Rost\u00f3v, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly\u2019s jacket and on a French cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him.", " Just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say precisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to Tar\u00fatino. Only when the army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying forces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result. CHAPTER II The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant. If instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the country was richest. That movement from the N\u00edzhni to the Ryaz\u00e1n, T\u00fala, and Kal\u00faga roads was so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and demands were sent from Petersburg for Kut\u00fazov to take his army that way. At Tar\u00fatino Kut\u00fazov received what was almost a reprimand from the Emperor for having moved his army along the Ryaz\u00e1n road, and the Emperor\u2019s letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near Kal\u00faga.", " Obviously in spite of himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood. Beginning with the battle of Borodin\u00f3, from which time his disagreement with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death. He alone said that the loss of Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to Lauriston\u2019s proposal of peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the people\u2019s will. He alone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are useless, everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire; that the enemy must be offered \u201ca golden bridge\u201d; that neither the Tar\u00fatino, the Vy\u00e1zma, nor the Kr\u00e1snoe battles were necessary; that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that he would not sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen. And this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakch\u00e9ev to please the Emperor, he alone\u2014incurring thereby the Emperor\u2019s displeasure\u2014said in V\u00edlna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful. Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events. His actions\u2014without the smallest deviation\u2014were all directed to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army."], "Who rescues Mary from the rioting peasants who will not allow her to leave Bogucharovo?": [" \u201cNo, there\u2019s not much to be amused at here,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, and rode on a little way. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cI make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don\u2019t wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her excellency cannot get away.\u201d \u201cImpossible!\u201d exclaimed Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI have the honor to report to you the actual truth,\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych. Rost\u00f3v dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alp\u00e1tych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared that the princess\u2019 offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alp\u00e1tych sent for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the horses. Alp\u00e1tych had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything.", " At the moment when Rost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn were galloping along the road, Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alp\u00e1tych, her nurse, and the maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran away, and the women in the house began to wail. \u201cFather! Benefactor! God has sent you!\u201d exclaimed deeply moved voices as Rost\u00f3v passed through the anteroom. Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room, when Rost\u00f3v was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This meeting immediately struck Rost\u00f3v as a romantic event. \u201cA helpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression!\u201d thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story. When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her father\u2019s funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry.", " \u201cDischarge me, little mother, for God\u2019s sake! Order the keys to be taken from me,\u201d said he. \u201cI have served twenty-three years and have done no wrong. Discharge me, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants. CHAPTER XI An hour later Duny\u00e1sha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess\u2019 order and wished to have word with their mistress. \u201cBut I never told them to come,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI only told Dron to let them have the grain.\u201d \u201cOnly, for God\u2019s sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and don\u2019t go out to them. It\u2019s all a trick,\u201d said Duny\u00e1sha, \u201cand when Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych returns let us get away... and please don\u2019t...\u201d \u201cWhat is a trick?\u201d asked Princess Mary in surprise. \u201cI know it is, only listen to me for God\u2019s sake! Ask nurse too. They say they don\u2019t agree to leave Boguch\u00e1rovo as you ordered.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cCall Dr\u00f3nushka.\u201d Dron came and confirmed Duny\u00e1sha\u2019s words; the peasants had come by the princess\u2019 order. \u201cBut I never sent for them,\u201d declared the princess. \u201cYou must have given my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.\u201d Dron only sighed in reply.", " Alp\u00e1tych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with him with difficulty. \u201cWhat decision have you been pleased to come to?\u201d said he. Rost\u00f3v stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on Alp\u00e1tych. \u201cDecision? What decision? Old dotard!...\u201d cried he. \u201cWhat have you been about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can\u2019t manage them? You\u2019re a traitor yourself! I know you. I\u2019ll flay you all alive!...\u201d And as if afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alp\u00e1tych and went rapidly forward. Alp\u00e1tych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with Rost\u00f3v at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to \u201coverresist\u201d them without an armed force, and would it not be better first to send for the military? \u201cI\u2019ll give them armed force... I\u2019ll \u2018overresist\u2019 them!\u201d uttered Rost\u00f3v meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it. Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick, resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more Alp\u00e1tych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results. The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw Rost\u00f3v\u2019s rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face. After the hussars had come to the village and Rost\u00f3v had gone to see the princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd."], "After seeing an amputation being performed on Anatole, the injured Andrew decides that ___ is the greatest human emotion.": [" He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home. Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\u00f3lokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see Nat\u00e1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\u2019s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The countess\u2019 drawing room was full of guests. Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return\u2014at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever\u2014entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him. \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room. \u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.", " Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety. Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him. \u201cYou promised Countess Rost\u00f3va to marry her and were about to elope with her, is that so?\u201d \u201cMon cher,\u201d answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French), \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone.\u201d Pierre\u2019s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till Anatole\u2019s face showed a sufficient degree of terror. \u201cWhen I tell you that I must talk to you!...\u201d repeated Pierre. \u201cCome now, this is stupid. What?\u201d said Anatole, fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth. \u201cYou\u2019re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don\u2019t know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!\u201d said Pierre, expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French. He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put it back in its place. \u201cDid you promise to marry her?\u201d \u201cI... I didn\u2019t think of it. I never promised, because...\u201d Pierre interrupted him. \u201cHave you any letters of hers? Any letters?\u201d he said, moving toward Anatole. Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook.", " \u201cNow you, young prince, what\u2019s your name?\u201d said Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, turning to Anatole, \u201ccome here, let us talk and get acquainted.\u201d \u201cNow the fun begins,\u201d thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince. \u201cWell, my dear boy, I hear you\u2019ve been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?\u201d asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently. \u201cNo, I have been transferred to the line,\u201d said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter. \u201cAh! That\u2019s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?\u201d \u201cNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?\u201d said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh. \u201cA splendid soldier, splendid! \u2018What am I attached to!\u2019 Ha, ha, ha!\u201d laughed Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolk\u00f3nski frowned. \u201cYou may go,\u201d he said to Anatole. Anatole returned smiling to the ladies. \u201cAnd so you\u2019ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vas\u00edli, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said the old prince to Prince Vas\u00edli. \u201cI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours.\u201d \u201cYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad\u2019s a fine fellow, a fine fellow!", " D\u00f3lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an ironic smile: \u201cDo you know? You\u2019d really better drop it all. There\u2019s still time!\u201d \u201cFool,\u201d retorted Anatole. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! If you only knew... it\u2019s the devil knows what!\u201d \u201cNo, really, give it up!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI am speaking seriously. It\u2019s no joke, this plot you\u2019ve hatched.\u201d \u201cWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?\u201d said Anatole, making a grimace. \u201cReally it\u2019s no time for your stupid jokes,\u201d and he left the room. D\u00f3lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out. \u201cYou wait a bit,\u201d he called after him. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, I\u2019m talking sense. Come here, come here!\u201d Anatole returned and looked at D\u00f3lokhov, trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily. \u201cNow listen to me. I\u2019m telling you this for the last time. Why should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I did it all.\u201d \u201cWell, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?\u201d And Anatole sighed and embraced D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a dangerous business, and if you think about it\u2014a stupid business. Well, you\u2019ll carry her off\u2014all right! Will they let it stop at that? It will come out that you\u2019re already married. Why, they\u2019ll have you in the criminal court....\u201d \u201cOh, nonsense, nonsense!\u201d Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace."], "After the battle at Borodino, Kutuzov decides ___ must be left for the French.": [" The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodin\u00f3 to the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else. The French historians, describing the condition of the French army before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army, except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport\u2014there was no forage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the French have it. The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered them, but burned it instead. Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it.", " The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued. Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out. The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army. The French, with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon\u2019s invincibility, with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort.", " My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir\u2014a blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.\u2019 \u201cThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isn\u2019t it logical? \u201cThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal\u2019s departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle. Buxh\u00f6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle \u2018on his own hand\u2019 as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pult\u00fask, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pult\u00fask. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxh\u00f6wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxh\u00f6wden who by right of seniority should be our chief.", " So it happened that throughout the whole battle the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left flank with but half as many men. (Poniatowski\u2019s action against Ut\u00edtsa, and Uv\u00e1rov\u2019s on the right flank against the French, were actions distinct from the main course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodin\u00f3 did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders\u2019 mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it has been described. The battle of Borodin\u00f3 was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodin\u00f3 on an open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight. CHAPTER XX On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozh\u00e1ysk. At the descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers."], "What causes Helene to make a large donation to the Catholic Church?": [" A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which H\u00e9l\u00e8ne gave at her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert, a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes, a Jesuit \u00e0 robe courte * was presented to her, and in the garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the consolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and the next. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance, for which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de Jobert came to see H\u00e9l\u00e8ne when she was alone, and after that often came again. * Lay member of the Society of Jesus. One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul. It was explained to her that this was la gr\u00e2ce. After that a long-frocked abb\u00e9 was brought to her. She confessed to him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to partake of.", " Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows. The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power\u2014the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and guns\u2014should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes.", " We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smol\u00e9nsk and Moscow and were killed by them. To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war.", " Pierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment. \u201cWhat for? Why? What is going on in the world?\u201d he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by experience that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from them, and took up a book, or hurried off to the club or to Apoll\u00f3n Nikol\u00e1evich\u2019s, to exchange the gossip of the town. \u201cH\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of the stupidest women in the world,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cis regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they pay homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor Francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French, also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers, and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not understand."], "On her way out of the city, Natasha encounters whom?": [" By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance, distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Pokl\u00f3nny Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the breathing of that great and beautiful body. Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it. \u201cCette ville asiatique aux innombrables \u00e9glises, Moscou la sainte. La voil\u00e0 donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il \u00e9tait temps,\u201d * said he, and dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and summoned Lelorgne d\u2019Ideville, the interpreter. * \u201cThat Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was high time.\u201d \u201cA town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,\u201d thought he (he had said so to T\u00fachkov at Smol\u00e9nsk). From that point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable, had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him. \u201cBut could it be otherwise?\u201d he thought. \u201cHere is this capital at my feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking?", " Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tut\u00f3lmin, he dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate. With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopch\u00edn was punished by an order to burn down his houses. With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a constitution. A municipality was established and the following announcement issued: INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW! Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm. The city police is established on its former footing, and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city.", " Many of them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select cal\u00e8ches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered. There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city. The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme f\u00e9roce de Rostopch\u00edne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality, however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible for it.", " Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening, amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both in the shops and houses\u2014but there was no army. Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call for that very evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had till then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city. No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers\u2014like water percolating through sand\u2014spread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the Kr\u00e9mlin into which they had first marched. The cavalry, on entering a merchant\u2019s house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on, all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better."], "In the Poklonny Hills near Moscow, Napoleon is startled by what news regarding the city?": [" By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance, distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Pokl\u00f3nny Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the breathing of that great and beautiful body. Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it. \u201cCette ville asiatique aux innombrables \u00e9glises, Moscou la sainte. La voil\u00e0 donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il \u00e9tait temps,\u201d * said he, and dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and summoned Lelorgne d\u2019Ideville, the interpreter. * \u201cThat Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was high time.\u201d \u201cA town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,\u201d thought he (he had said so to T\u00fachkov at Smol\u00e9nsk). From that point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable, had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him. \u201cBut could it be otherwise?\u201d he thought. \u201cHere is this capital at my feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking?", " Some said there had been another battle after Borodin\u00f3 at which the French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the Russian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of Fil\u00ed, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained behind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so. As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life, though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset. During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole Rost\u00f3v family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the family, Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, continually drove about the city collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about the preparations for their departure.", " From Vy\u00e1zma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow. Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacr\u00e9e des peuples d\u2019Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables \u00e9glises en forme de pagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleon\u2019s imagination no rest. On the march from Vy\u00e1zma to Ts\u00e1revo-Zaym\u00edshche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages, and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by Lelorgne d\u2019Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression. * \u201cMoscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the sacred city of Alexander\u2019s people, Moscow with its innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d asked Napoleon. \u201cOne of Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s Cossacks says that Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s corps is joining up with the main army and that Kut\u00fazov has been appointed commander in chief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.\u201d Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavr\u00fashka, the serf Den\u00edsov had handed over to Rost\u00f3v, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly\u2019s jacket and on a French cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him.", " Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tut\u00f3lmin, he dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate. With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopch\u00edn was punished by an order to burn down his houses. With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a constitution. A municipality was established and the following announcement issued: INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW! Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm. The city police is established on its former footing, and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city."], "Pierre plans to kill whom?": [" The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend\u2019s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew\u2019s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He checked himself, fearing to seem na\u00efve, yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly know myself again.\u201d \u201cYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cWell, and you? What are your plans?\u201d \u201cPlans!\u201d repeated Prince Andrew ironically. \u201cMy plans?\u201d he said, as if astonished at the word. \u201cWell, you see, I\u2019m building. I mean to settle here altogether next year....\u201d Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew\u2019s face, which had grown much older. \u201cNo, I meant to ask...\u201d Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates.\u201d Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made.", " But you know it is all over, and forever.\u201d \u201cForever?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cNothing\u2019s forever.\u201d \u201cBut you know how it all ended, don\u2019t you? You heard of the duel?\u201d \u201cAnd so you had to go through that too!\u201d \u201cOne thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cWhy so?\u201d asked Prince Andrew. \u201cTo kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really.\u201d \u201cNo, to kill a man is bad\u2014wrong.\u201d \u201cWhy is it wrong?\u201d urged Prince Andrew. \u201cIt is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will err, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.\u201d \u201cWhat does harm to another is wrong,\u201d said Pierre, feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state. \u201cAnd who has told you what is bad for another man?\u201d he asked. \u201cBad! Bad!\u201d exclaimed Pierre. \u201cWe all know what is bad for ourselves.\u201d \u201cYes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I cannot inflict on others,\u201d said Prince Andrew, growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre. He spoke in French. \u201cI only know two very real evils in life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils. To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now.\u201d \u201cAnd love of one\u2019s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?\u201d began Pierre.", " It was the eldest who was reading\u2014the one who had met Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern. \u201cHow do you do, cousin?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cYou don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d \u201cI recognize you only too well, too well.\u201d \u201cHow is the count? Can I see him?\u201d asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed. \u201cThe count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.\u201d \u201cCan I see the count?\u201d Pierre again asked. \u201cHm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle\u2019s beef tea is ready\u2014it is almost time,\u201d she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.", " I have no right to, and can\u2019t, believe it.\u201d He remembered the expression D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s face assumed in his moments of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason, or shot a post-boy\u2019s horse with a pistol. That expression was often on D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s face when looking at him. \u201cYes, he is a bully,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cto kill a man means nothing to him. It must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him. He must think that I, too, am afraid of him\u2014and in fact I am afraid of him,\u201d he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul. D\u00f3lokhov, Den\u00edsov, and Rost\u00f3v were now sitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rost\u00f3v was talking merrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner. Rost\u00f3v looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a word\u2014an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rost\u00f3v and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor\u2019s health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass."], "As Moscow burns, what happens in St. Petersburg?": [" Though Nicholas Rost\u00f3v had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little, the way of life at Otr\u00e1dnoe\u2014M\u00edtenka\u2019s management of affairs, in particular\u2014was such that the debts inevitably increased every year. The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time. Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to V\u00e9ra and was accepted. Though in Moscow the Rost\u00f3vs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them. The Rost\u00f3vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country neighbors from Otr\u00e1dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Per\u00f3nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bez\u00fakhov, and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house in Petersburg were Bor\u00eds, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and paid the eldest daughter, Countess V\u00e9ra, the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose.", " The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemy\u2019s hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark on it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean. So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and morose, paced up and down in front of the K\u00e1mmer-Koll\u00e9zski rampart, awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of the proprieties\u2014a deputation. In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing. When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently continued to walk to and fro. \u201cMy carriage!\u201d he said. He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the suburb. \u201cMoscow deserted!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhat an incredible event!\u201d He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dorogom\u00edlov suburb.", " \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped! It happens to everyone!\u201d said the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father\u2019s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone! The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\u2019s words and began bustlingly searching for something. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he muttered, \u201cit will be difficult, I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\u201d And with a furtive glance at his son\u2019s face, the count went out of the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all expected this. \u201cPapa! Pa-pa!\u201d he called after him, sobbing, \u201cforgive me!\u201d And seizing his father\u2019s hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears. While father and son were having their explanation, the mother and daughter were having one not less important. Nat\u00e1sha came running to her mother, quite excited. \u201cMamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...\u201d \u201cMade what?\u201d \u201cMade, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!\u201d she exclaimed. The countess did not believe her ears. Den\u00edsov had proposed. To whom? To this chit of a girl, Nat\u00e1sha, who not so long ago was playing with dolls and who was still having lessons. \u201cDon\u2019t, Nat\u00e1sha! What nonsense!\u201d she said, hoping it was a joke. \u201cNonsense, indeed!", " Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow. \u201cWhat are you disputing about?\u201d said the major angrily. \u201cWhat does it matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it\u2019s burned down, and there\u2019s an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn\u2019t the road wide enough?\u201d said he, turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all. \u201cOh, oh, oh! What have they done?\u201d the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. \u201cAll beyond the river, and Z\u00fabova, and in the Kr\u00e9mlin.... Just look! There\u2019s not half of it left. Yes, I told you\u2014the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it is.\u201d \u201cWell, you know it\u2019s burned, so what\u2019s the use of talking?\u201d said the major."], "What charges do the French levy against Pierre?": [" P\u00e9tya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair. He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars. Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what P\u00e9tya was saying. P\u00e9tya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention. \u201cWell, what about my plan? Peter Kir\u00edlych, for heaven\u2019s sake! You are my only hope,\u201d said P\u00e9tya. \u201cOh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I\u2019ll mention it, I\u2019ll bring it all up today.\u201d \u201cWell, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?\u201d asked the old count. \u201cThe countess has been to Mass at the Razum\u00f3vskis\u2019 and heard the new prayer. She says it\u2019s very fine.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cThe Emperor is to be here tomorrow... there\u2019s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate you!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?\u201d \u201cWe are again retreating. They say we\u2019re already near Smol\u00e9nsk,\u201d replied Pierre. \u201cO Lord, O Lord!\u201d exclaimed the count. \u201cWhere is the manifesto?\u201d \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s appeal? Oh yes!\u201d Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting Nat\u00e1sha, who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room. \u201cOn my word, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done with it,\u201d he said.", " Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him. \u201cLieutenant, he has a dagger,\u201d were the first words Pierre understood. \u201cAh, a weapon?\u201d said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with Pierre. \u201cAll right, you can tell all about it at the court-martial.\u201d Then he turned to Pierre. \u201cDo you speak French?\u201d Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of Pierre. \u201cDo you speak French?\u201d the officer asked again, keeping at a distance from Pierre. \u201cCall the interpreter.\u201d A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops. \u201cHe does not look like a common man,\u201d said the interpreter, after a searching look at Pierre. \u201cAh, he looks very much like an incendiary,\u201d remarked the officer.", " The young officer, with his face still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business with strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as though they were on springs. The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to his superior. \u201cI have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are we to continue firing?\u201d he asked. \u201cGrapeshot!\u201d the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking over the wall of the trench. Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre\u2019s eyes. One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting \u201cHurrah!\u201d were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre. A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back.", " \u201cAll with grapeshot!\u201d shouted the officer. The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges. \u201cThe scoundrels! What are they doing?\u201d shouted the officer, turning to Pierre. The officer\u2019s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow. \u201cRun to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!\u201d he yelled, angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d said Pierre. The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side. \u201cDon\u2019t fire.... Wait!\u201d he shouted. The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against Pierre. \u201cEh, sir, this is no place for you,\u201d said he, and ran down the slope. Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was sitting. One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front, beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on. Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle. When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed, only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and piercing cries."], "Who is with Andrew when he dies?": [" She thought of her nephew. Her husband\u2019s account of the boy\u2019s agitation while Pierre was speaking struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young Nicholas. Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible\u2014in this life to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Mary\u2019s soul always strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas gazed at her. \u201cO God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?\u201d thought he, and placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers. CHAPTER XVI Nat\u00e1sha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity, understanding and expressing each other\u2019s thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in a quite peculiar way.", " \u201cHow can one help it, lad? My name is Plat\u00f3n, and the surname is Karat\u00e1ev,\u201d he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to address him. \u201cThey call me \u2018little falcon\u2019 in the regiment. How is one to help feeling sad? Moscow\u2014she\u2019s the mother of cities. How can one see all this and not feel sad? But \u2018the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies first\u2019; that\u2019s what the old folks used to tell us,\u201d he added rapidly. \u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201d asked Pierre. \u201cWho? I?\u201d said Karat\u00e1ev. \u201cI say things happen not as we plan but as God judges,\u201d he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said before, and immediately continued: \u201cWell, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still living?\u201d he asked. And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier\u2019s lips as he put these questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that he had no mother. \u201cA wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there\u2019s none as dear as one\u2019s own mother!\u201d said he. \u201cWell, and have you little ones?\u201d he went on asking. Again Pierre\u2019s negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened to add: \u201cNever mind! You\u2019re young folks yet, and please God may still have some. The great thing is to live in harmony....\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s all the same now,\u201d Pierre could not help saying.", " He did it all silently and very quickly. He stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed. \u201cForgive me for troubling you....\u201d Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Nat\u00e1sha, and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued: \u201cI have received a refusal from Countess Rost\u00f3va and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind. Is that true?\u201d \u201cBoth true and untrue,\u201d Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cHere are her letters and her portrait,\u201d said he. He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre. \u201cGive this to the countess... if you see her.\u201d \u201cShe is very ill,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cThen she is here still?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cAnd Prince Kur\u00e1gin?\u201d he added quickly. \u201cHe left long ago. She has been at death\u2019s door.\u201d \u201cI much regret her illness,\u201d said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly. \u201cSo Monsieur Kur\u00e1gin has not honored Countess Rost\u00f3va with his hand?\u201d said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times. \u201cHe could not marry, for he was married already,\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father. \u201cAnd where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?\u201d he said. \u201cHe has gone to Peters... But I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Pierre.", " The angel\u2019s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angel\u2019s face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel\u2019s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: \u201cAh, why have you done this to me?\u201d Soon after Prince Andrew\u2019s return the old prince made over to him a large estate, Boguch\u00e1rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father\u2019s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Boguch\u00e1rovo, began building and spent most of his time there. After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man, roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side."], "Where does Pierre feel happiness?": [" He pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre\u2019s happiness. The old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. \u201cOh, the old fool,\u201d he thought. \u201cThat Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne will be beautiful still when she\u2019s fifty.\u201d \u201cI think I may congratulate you,\u201d whispered Anna P\u00e1vlovna to the old princess, kissing her soundly. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t this headache I\u2019d have stayed longer.\u201d The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her daughter\u2019s happiness. While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time alone with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in the little drawing room where they were sitting. He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable, but he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone else\u2019s place here beside H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. \u201cThis happiness is not for you,\u201d some inner voice whispered to him. \u201cThis happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you.\u201d But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had. Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in the large drawing room. Prince Vas\u00edli came up to Pierre with languid footsteps.", " Isn\u2019t Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and self-confident? I believe all this\u2014and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and she will be sure to smile and say: \u2018How strange! He must be deluding himself. Doesn\u2019t he know that he is a man, just a man, while I...? I am something altogether different and higher.\u2019\u201d That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended with that. A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable, possessed him. The whole meaning of life\u2014not for him alone but for the whole world\u2014seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only\u2014his future happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention.", " Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness. Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her sister-in-law\u2019s dress. \u201cThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know, Mary, I am going to love him very much,\u201d said Lise, looking with bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law. Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping. \u201cWhat is the matter, Mary?\u201d \u201cNothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,\u201d she said, wiping away her tears on her sister-in-law\u2019s knee. Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women, and suddenly began to cry. \u201cHas anything come from Andrew?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo, you know it\u2019s too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I feel afraid.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant eyes at her sister-in-law.", " The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend\u2019s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew\u2019s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He checked himself, fearing to seem na\u00efve, yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly know myself again.\u201d \u201cYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cWell, and you? What are your plans?\u201d \u201cPlans!\u201d repeated Prince Andrew ironically. \u201cMy plans?\u201d he said, as if astonished at the word. \u201cWell, you see, I\u2019m building. I mean to settle here altogether next year....\u201d Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew\u2019s face, which had grown much older. \u201cNo, I meant to ask...\u201d Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates.\u201d Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made."], "The relationship between Natasha and Andrew is mirrored by the relationship between Nicholas and whom?": [" To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the Deity. If the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event. But speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another, to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that takes place: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands, and (2) the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command. CHAPTER VI Only the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time, can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can by His sole will determine the direction of humanity\u2019s movement; but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs. Reinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible. No command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.", " Rost\u00f3v saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He felt that the being before him was quite different from, and better than, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself. Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it; they spoke of their last meeting\u2014Nicholas trying to change the subject\u2014they talked of the governor\u2019s kind wife, of Nicholas\u2019 relations, and of Princess Mary\u2019s. She did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russia\u2019s misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary\u2019s character with an observation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and even when he thought of her, but in her presence he felt quite at ease, and said not at all what he had prepared, but what, quite appropriately, occurred to him at the moment. When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when there are children, turned to Prince Andrew\u2019s little son, caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar.", " As they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As \u2018twas growing dark last night\u2014the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught. \u201cGot it?\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cWhat were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?\u201d inquired Nat\u00e1sha. They were fond of asking one another that question. \u201cI?\u201d said Nicholas, trying to remember. \u201cWell, you see, first I thought that Rug\u00e1y, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then for his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don\u2019t you think so?... Well, and you?\u201d \u201cI? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in Otr\u00e1dnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I thought... No, nothing else.\u201d \u201cI know, I expect you thought of him,\u201d said Nicholas, smiling as Nat\u00e1sha knew by the sound of his voice. \u201cNo,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, though she had in reality been thinking about Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would have liked \u201cUncle.\u201d \u201cAnd then I was saying to myself all the way, \u2018How well An\u00edsya carried herself, how well!\u2019\u201d And Nicholas heard her spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. \u201cAnd do you know,\u201d she suddenly said, \u201cI know that I shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now.\u201d \u201cRubbish, nonsense, humbug!\u201d exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought: \u201cHow charming this Nat\u00e1sha of mine is!", " \u201cYes, they say it\u2019s burned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great pity,\u201d and he gazed straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers. \u201cAnd so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?\u201d Prince Andrew suddenly said, evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. \u201cHe wrote here that he took a great liking to you,\u201d he went on simply and calmly, evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for living people. \u201cIf you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you to get married,\u201d he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking. Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living. \u201cWhy talk of me?\u201d she said quietly and glanced at Nat\u00e1sha. Nat\u00e1sha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again silent. \u201cAndrew, would you like...\u201d Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling voice, \u201cwould you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking about you!\u201d Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him. \u201cYes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?\u201d When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew\u2019s room he looked at his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else was crying."], "When Dolokhov and Denisov encounter retreating French troops, what do they do?": [" This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection! NAPOLEON MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812 Kut\u00fazov replied: \u201cI should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit of my nation.\u201d But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking. During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tar\u00fatino, a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies\u2014both in spirit and in number\u2014as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston\u2019s mission; the abundance of provisions at Tar\u00fatino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at Tar\u00fatino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every soldier\u2019s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side.", " The wound had begun to heal from within. At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count insisted on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s going with her to consult the doctors. CHAPTER IV After the encounter at Vy\u00e1zma, where Kut\u00fazov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians who pursued them, continued as far as Kr\u00e1snoe without a battle. The flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the information received of the movements of the French was never reliable. The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any faster. To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tar\u00fatino and less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached Kr\u00e1snoe with only fifty thousand. The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their own people.", " But to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army, who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some reason to capture a king or a duke\u2014it seemed that now\u2014when any battle must be horrible and senseless\u2014was the very time to fight and conquer somebody. Kut\u00fazov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers\u2014ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved\u2014who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number, and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the frontier. This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on the French army. So it was at Kr\u00e1snoe, where they expected to find one of the three French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men. Despite all Kut\u00fazov\u2019s efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Kr\u00e1snoe for three days. Toll wrote a disposition: \u201cThe first column will march to so and so,\u201d etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition. Prince Eug\u00e8ne of W\u00fcrttemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds that were running past, and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive.", " Since then, and until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach Sh\u00e1mshevo quietly without alarming them and then, after joining D\u00f3lokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman\u2019s hut in the forest less than a mile from Sh\u00e1mshevo, to surprise the French at dawn, falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and rout and capture them all at one blow. In their rear, more than a mile from Mik\u00falino where the forest came right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of French should show themselves. Beyond Sh\u00e1mshevo, D\u00f3lokhov was to observe the road in the same way, to find out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Den\u00edsov had two hundred, and D\u00f3lokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not deter Den\u00edsov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a \u201ctongue\u201d\u2014that is, a man from the enemy column. That morning\u2019s attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column. Den\u00edsov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent T\u00edkhon Shcherb\u00e1ty, a peasant of his party, to Sh\u00e1mshevo to try and seize at least one of the French quartermasters who had been sent on in advance."], "What causes Natasha\u2019s father to insist that she go to Moscow?": [" Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows. The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power\u2014the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and guns\u2014should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes.", " We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smol\u00e9nsk and Moscow and were killed by them. To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war.", " To discover and define those laws is the problem of history. From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in man\u2019s free will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible, for however man\u2019s free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes impossible. Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as its problem. The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self-destruction toward which\u2014ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena\u2014the old method of history is moving. All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all unknown, infinitely small, elements. In another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded.", " She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, \u201cdo not turn away from me, let us weep together.\u201d \u201cScoundrels! Blackguards!\u201d shrieked the old man, turning his face away from her. \u201cDestroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go, go and tell Lise.\u201d The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. \u201cDid he believe? Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms of eternal peace and blessedness?\u201d she thought. \u201cFather, tell me how it happened,\u201d she asked through her tears. \u201cGo! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and Russia\u2019s glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell Lise. I will follow.\u201d When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something joyful and mysterious taking place within her. \u201cMary,\u201d she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back, \u201cgive me your hand.\u201d She took her sister-in-law\u2019s hand and held it below her waist."], "Over what do the tsar and Kutuzov disagree?": [" Stopping in front of the P\u00e1vlograds, the Tsar said something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled. Seeing that smile, Rost\u00f3v involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him. \u201cOh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI should die of happiness!\u201d The Tsar addressed the officers also: \u201cI thank you all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart.\u201d To Rost\u00f3v every word sounded like a voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar! \u201cYou have earned the St. George\u2019s standards and will be worthy of them.\u201d \u201cOh, to die, to die for him,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. The Tsar said something more which Rost\u00f3v did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d Rost\u00f3v too, bending over his saddle, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully. The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided. \u201cHow can the Emperor be undecided?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything else the Tsar did. That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar\u2019s foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp.", " Hurrah!\u201d thundered from all sides, one regiment after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then \u201cHurrah!\u201d... Then the general march, and again \u201cHurrah! Hurrah!\u201d growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar. Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices, amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two men\u2014the Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated. The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Rost\u00f3v was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every movement of the Tsar\u2019s seemed to him enchanting.", " The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts. Late that night, when all had separated, Den\u00edsov with his short hand patted his favorite, Rost\u00f3v, on the shoulder. \u201cAs there\u2019s no one to fall in love with on campaign, he\u2019s fallen in love with the Tsar,\u201d he said. \u201cDen\u00edsov, don\u2019t make fun of it!\u201d cried Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIt is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...\u201d \u201cI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...\u201d \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d And Rost\u00f3v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to die\u2014not in saving the Emperor\u2019s life (he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms. CHAPTER XI The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded.", " That murderer confessed to the authorities. \u2018I have taken six lives,\u2019 he says (he was a great sinner), \u2018but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don\u2019t let him suffer because of me.\u2019 So he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the papers all in due form\u2014the authorities I mean\u2014time passed. The affair reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar\u2019s decree came: to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the old man. \u2018Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A paper has come from the Tsar!\u2019 so they began looking for him,\u201d here Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s lower jaw trembled, \u201cbut God had already forgiven him\u2014he was dead! That\u2019s how it was, dear fellows!\u201d Karat\u00e1ev concluded and sat for a long time silent, gazing before him with a smile. And Pierre\u2019s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy. CHAPTER XIV \u201c\u00c0 vos places!\u201d * suddenly cried a voice. * \u201cTo your places.\u201d A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners."], "After the war, people notice that Pierre has changed in which of the following ways?": [" \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored. \u201cBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country\u2019s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone.", " \u201cThat is all nonsense.\u201d Prince Andrew again interrupted him, \u201clet us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?\u201d \u201cNo, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right.\u201d Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre\u2019s childish words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this na\u00efve question. \u201cIf no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that would be splendid,\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew smiled ironically. \u201cVery likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....\u201d \u201cWell, why are you going to the war?\u201d asked Pierre. \u201cWhat for? I don\u2019t know. I must. Besides that I am going....\u201d He paused. \u201cI am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!\u201d CHAPTER VII The rustle of a woman\u2019s dress was heard in the next room. Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other.", " The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair. \u201cNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....\u201d \u201cYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cYou had better go.\u201d The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room. Pierre looked over his spectacles with na\u00efve surprise, now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind. \u201cWhy should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?\u201d exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. \u201cI have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?\u201d \u201cLise!\u201d was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly: \u201cYou treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave like that six months ago?\u201d \u201cLise, I beg you to desist,\u201d said Prince Andrew still more emphatically. Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself. \u201cCalm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me!", " He tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat, who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse\u2019s hoofs. \u201cWhy ride into the middle of the battalion?\u201d one of them shouted at him. Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre, bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space. There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing. Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the Koloch\u00e1 between G\u00f3rki and Borodin\u00f3, which the French (having occupied Borodin\u00f3) were attacking in the first phase of the battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow, among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded, though many fell near him."], "How does Pierre react to Moscow\u2019s ruins?": [" Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow. \u201cWhat are you disputing about?\u201d said the major angrily. \u201cWhat does it matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it\u2019s burned down, and there\u2019s an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn\u2019t the road wide enough?\u201d said he, turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all. \u201cOh, oh, oh! What have they done?\u201d the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. \u201cAll beyond the river, and Z\u00fabova, and in the Kr\u00e9mlin.... Just look! There\u2019s not half of it left. Yes, I told you\u2014the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it is.\u201d \u201cWell, you know it\u2019s burned, so what\u2019s the use of talking?\u201d said the major.", " But what this program consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they continually contradict one another. Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation\u2019s progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom, or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not to mention the historians\u2019 contradictions as to the nature of this program\u2014or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists\u2014the facts of history almost always contradict that theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis XIV and Iv\u00e1n the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians reply that Louis XIV\u2019s activity, contrary to the program, reacted on Louis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV\u2014why should it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such reactions? To these questions there are and can be no answers. Equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican government, and to Napoleon III.", " Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled house\u2014which in dull weather was repulsively ugly\u2014seemed quietly beautiful now, in the clear, motionless brilliance. A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly wink. \u201cWhat sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!\u201d (Their name for Pierre.) \u201cEh? Just like spring!\u201d And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe, though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it. \u201cTo be on the march in such weather...\u201d he began. Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day. Sokol\u00f3v, one of the soldiers in the shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick, and that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities. \u201cBesides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain, you know. He is a man who never forgets anything.", " From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on him\u2014as if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to receive impressions that might weaken it. The women\u2019s vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts, more soldiers, and now and then women. Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement. All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly; they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the corporal\u2019s face when the drums were beating. It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged onto the Kal\u00faga road."], "The narrator asserts that history is made by what?": [" Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action, people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other words that it is a law. CHAPTER VIII If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history, says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law. The presence of the problem of man\u2019s free will, though unexpressed, is felt at every step of history. All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question. If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.", " But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind (which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power\u2014and say plainly that that was the result of Napoleon\u2019s will. Speaking so, the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize. CHAPTER III A locomotive is moving. Someone asks: \u201cWhat moves it?\u201d A peasant says the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away. The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil, or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong.", " If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not the history of the life of the peoples. CHAPTER V The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found. The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history. The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur\u2014that is, as soon as history begins\u2014that theory explains nothing. The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the people\u2019s will cannot be verified, for it never occurred. Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him. The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.", " So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability, what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life. CHAPTER XI History examines the manifestations of man\u2019s free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws. The recognition of man\u2019s free will as something capable of influencing historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy. That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws, that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law can exist, nor any conception of historical events. For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of man\u2019s will in the present moves in space, time, and dependence on cause. The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more evident are the laws of that movement."], "Before Nicholas marries Mary, he hides what from his mother and sister?": [" Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness. Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her sister-in-law\u2019s dress. \u201cThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know, Mary, I am going to love him very much,\u201d said Lise, looking with bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law. Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping. \u201cWhat is the matter, Mary?\u201d \u201cNothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,\u201d she said, wiping away her tears on her sister-in-law\u2019s knee. Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women, and suddenly began to cry. \u201cHas anything come from Andrew?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo, you know it\u2019s too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I feel afraid.\u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant eyes at her sister-in-law.", " Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life\u2014love\u2014was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life. Prince Andrew\u2019s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat\u00e1sha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother\u2019s bedroom had strained Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s physical strength. One afternoon noticing Nat\u00e1sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Nat\u00e1sha lay down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\u201d \u201cYou are tired\u2014try to sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\u201d \u201cShe is much better. She spoke so well today,\u201d said Princess Mary. Nat\u00e1sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned Princess Mary\u2019s face. \u201cIs she like him?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYes, like and yet not like. But she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\u2019s hand to herself, \u201cMary, you mustn\u2019t think me wicked.", " As she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: \u201cPapa! Mamma\u2019s standing here!\u201d Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and his voice said crossly: \u201cI can\u2019t get a moment\u2019s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring him here?\u201d \u201cI only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....\u201d Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little black-eyed three-year-old Nat\u00e1sha, her father\u2019s pet, having learned from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs, and having examined the position of her father, who was asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face.", " All who had known Nat\u00e1sha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband\u2014as she herself had once exclaimed at Otr\u00e1dnoe not so much in fun as in earnest\u2014and her mother was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood Nat\u00e1sha, and she kept saying that she had always known that Nat\u00e1sha would make an exemplary wife and mother. \u201cOnly she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds,\u201d said the countess, \u201cso that it even becomes absurd.\u201d Nat\u00e1sha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk, especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband. Nat\u00e1sha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery, of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradiction to all those rules."], "In the years that follow, Natasha dedicates herself to what?": [" A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone-built Kr\u00e9mlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant\u2019s coat. He grasped a musket and took aim at the French. \u201cFire!\u201d repeated the officer once more, and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously. The gate was again hidden by smoke. Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall, toward the Zn\u00e1menka. \u201cClear that away!\u201d said the officer, pointing to the beams and the corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw the corpses over the parapet. Who these men were nobody knew. \u201cClear that away!\u201d was all that was said of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory: \u201cThese wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and fired\u201d (the wretches) \u201cat the French. Some of them were sabered and the Kr\u00e9mlin was purged of their presence.\u201d Murat was informed that the way had been cleared.", " \u201cI imagine...\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this answer. \u201cHave you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?\u201d \u201cNo, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,\u201d said Pierre, so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying. \u201cI have been an atheist,\u201d answered Pierre. \u201cYou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life, therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?\u201d said the Rhetor, after a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d assented Pierre. The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast, and began to speak. \u201cNow I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,\u201d he said, \u201cand if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood with profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on which it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery... which has come down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first man\u2014a mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby to render them capable of receiving it.", " And this movement of reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and Sper\u00e1nski its chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness. Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal. The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations, turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown more manly, lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony, and acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him. The day after his interview with Count Arakch\u00e9ev, Prince Andrew spent the evening at Count Kochub\u00e9y\u2019s.", " He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do."], "Whom does Andrew\u2019s son adore?": [" Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.\u201d Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet. He felt that he must not say it. \u201cI will do it all, Father,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, now, good-by!\u201d He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced him. \u201cRemember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me, your old father...\u201d he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked: \u201cbut if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski, I shall be ashamed!\u201d \u201cYou need not have said that to me, Father,\u201d said the son with a smile. The old man was silent. \u201cI also wanted to ask you,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, \u201cif I\u2019m killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you\u2014as I said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.\u201d \u201cNot let the wife have him?\u201d said the old man, and laughed. They stood silent, facing one another. The old man\u2019s sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son\u2019s. Something twitched in the lower part of the old prince\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019ve said good-by. Go!\u201d he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry voice, opening his door. \u201cWhat is it? What?\u201d asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice. Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply. \u201cWell!\u201d he said, turning to his wife.", " Eh?\u201d \u201cFather, I did not want to judge,\u201d said Prince Andrew, in a hard and bitter tone, \u201cbut you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame\u2014the one to blame\u2014is that Frenchwoman.\u201d \u201cAh, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!\u201d said the old man in a low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: \u201cBe off, be off! Let not a trace of you remain here!...\u201d Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and T\u00edkhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day, before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son\u2019s rooms. The boy, curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee, and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him, and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee.", " \u201cNo, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and you\u2019ll listen at the door,\u201d and Nat\u00e1sha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall, where Den\u00edsov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his face in his hands. He jumped up at the sound of her light step. \u201cNataly,\u201d he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, \u201cdecide my fate. It is in your hands.\u201d \u201cVas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich, I\u2019m so sorry for you!... No, but you are so nice... but it won\u2019t do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always love you.\u201d Den\u00edsov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they heard the quick rustle of the countess\u2019 dress. She came up to them. \u201cVas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich, I thank you for the honor,\u201d she said, with an embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Den\u00edsov\u2014\u201cbut my daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my son\u2019s friend, you would have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not have obliged me to give this refusal.\u201d \u201cCountess...\u201d said Den\u00edsov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face. He tried to say more, but faltered. Nat\u00e1sha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began to sob aloud. \u201cCountess, I have done w\u2019ong,\u201d Den\u00edsov went on in an unsteady voice, \u201cbut believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family that I would give my life twice over...\u201d He looked at the countess, and seeing her severe face said: \u201cWell, good-by, Countess,\u201d and kissing her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without looking at Nat\u00e1sha.", " The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!\u201d And he went on writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. \u201cIf you have anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,\u201d he added. \u201cAbout my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands....\u201d \u201cWhy talk nonsense? Say what you want.\u201d \u201cWhen her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let him be here....\u201d The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his stern eyes on his son. \u201cI know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,\u201d said Prince Andrew, evidently confused. \u201cI know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.\u201d \u201cHm... Hm...\u201d muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was writing. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad business, eh?\u201d \u201cWhat is bad, Father?\u201d \u201cThe wife!\u201d said the old prince, briefly and significantly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand!\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cNo, it can\u2019t be helped, lad,\u201d said the prince. \u201cThey\u2019re all like that; one can\u2019t unmarry. Don\u2019t be afraid; I won\u2019t tell anyone, but you know it yourself.\u201d He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked straight into his son\u2019s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh."], "The narrator ends the novel by asserting that which of the following create(s) history?": [" Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action, people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other words that it is a law. CHAPTER VIII If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history, says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law. The presence of the problem of man\u2019s free will, though unexpressed, is felt at every step of history. All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question. If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.", " If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not the history of the life of the peoples. CHAPTER V The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found. The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history. The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur\u2014that is, as soon as history begins\u2014that theory explains nothing. The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the people\u2019s will cannot be verified, for it never occurred. Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him. The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.", " They described the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation. The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined. For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs. Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles. It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man\u2019s subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them in practice. Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations, which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity, modern history has postulated its own aims\u2014the welfare of the French, German, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent.", " So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability, what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life. CHAPTER XI History examines the manifestations of man\u2019s free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws. The recognition of man\u2019s free will as something capable of influencing historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy. That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws, that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law can exist, nor any conception of historical events. For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of man\u2019s will in the present moves in space, time, and dependence on cause. The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more evident are the laws of that movement."], "Whose spiritual odyssey spans the novel?": [" If you want anything come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.\u201d Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter had left the room Kut\u00fazov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis. Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that interview with Kut\u00fazov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man\u2014in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions, and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events\u2014the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should. \u201cHe will not bring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake anything,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cbut he will hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will\u2014the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else. And above all,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cone believes in him because he\u2019s Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: \u2018What they have brought us to!\u2019 and had a sob in it when he said he would \u2018make them eat horseflesh!\u2019\u201d On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the popular choice of Kut\u00fazov as commander in chief was received.", " During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes, and Nat\u00e1sha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes, but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly. \u201cHow glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won\u2019t you have some tea?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha went up to her. \u201cYou have improved in looks and grown more manly,\u201d continued the countess, taking her daughter\u2019s hand. \u201cMamma! What are you saying...\u201d \u201cNat\u00e1sha, he is no more, no more!\u201d And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first time. CHAPTER III Princess Mary postponed her departure. S\u00f3nya and the count tried to replace Nat\u00e1sha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks Nat\u00e1sha remained constantly at her mother\u2019s side, sleeping on a lounge chair in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her mother. The mother\u2019s wounded spirit could not heal. P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had torn from her half her life. When the news of P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Nat\u00e1sha to life. A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.", " When he met her again in Vor\u00f3nezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her. But that day\u2019s encounter in church had, he felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rost\u00f3v could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction. \u201cShe must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhy am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with S\u00f3nya?\u201d And he involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other\u2014a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were he free. How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife. But no, he could not imagine that.", " Yet in spite of that, his relation to her\u2014considerate, delicate, and loving\u2014not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Princess Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved, and was happy in regard to it. But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving Vor\u00f3nezh that those who saw her off, as they looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength. As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached Yarosl\u00e1vl the thought of what might await her there\u2014not after many days, but that very evening\u2014again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit. The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the Rost\u00f3vs were staying in Yarosl\u00e1vl, and in what condition Prince Andrew was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess\u2019 face that looked out at him from the window."], "Who becomes a widower when his wife, Lise, dies?": [" She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, \u201cdo not turn away from me, let us weep together.\u201d \u201cScoundrels! Blackguards!\u201d shrieked the old man, turning his face away from her. \u201cDestroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go, go and tell Lise.\u201d The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. \u201cDid he believe? Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms of eternal peace and blessedness?\u201d she thought. \u201cFather, tell me how it happened,\u201d she asked through her tears. \u201cGo! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and Russia\u2019s glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell Lise. I will follow.\u201d When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something joyful and mysterious taking place within her. \u201cMary,\u201d she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back, \u201cgive me your hand.\u201d She took her sister-in-law\u2019s hand and held it below her waist.", " It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company. \u201cYou are off to the war, Prince?\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna. \u201cGeneral Kut\u00fazov,\u201d said Bolk\u00f3nski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general\u2019s name like a Frenchman, \u201chas been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....\u201d \u201cAnd Lise, your wife?\u201d \u201cShe will go to the country.\u201d \u201cAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?\u201d \u201cAndr\u00e9,\u201d said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, \u201cthe vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!\u201d Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre\u2019s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile. \u201cThere now!... So you, too, are in the great world?\u201d said he to Pierre.", " It was as if she feared this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her. \u201cAnd it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this! Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.\u201d \u201cWhat else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...\u201d said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew had written in Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s album. \u201cMamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t, Nat\u00e1sha! Pray to God. \u2018Marriages are made in heaven,\u2019\u201d said her mother. \u201cDarling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother. At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him of his love for Nat\u00e1sha and his firm resolve to make her his wife. That day Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had a reception at her house. The French ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air. Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it.", " At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s wife, sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife. \u201cNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame,\u201d he thought. If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not? Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph Alex\u00e9evich. This is what he noted in his diary: Moscow, 17th November I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I have experienced. Joseph Alex\u00e9evich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint."], "Who practices forgiveness as a way of enduring her father\u2019s cruel treatment?": [" \u201cNo? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she\u2019s much to be pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don\u2019t need her, and she\u2019s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Iv\u00e1novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: \u2018We don\u2019t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.\u2019 Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.\u201d \u201cTo be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father\u2019s character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Prince Andrew asked suddenly. Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question. \u201cFor me? For me?... Trying for me!...\u201d said she. \u201cHe always was rather harsh; and now I should think he\u2019s getting very trying,\u201d said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister. \u201cYou are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride,\u201d said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke?", " To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little Nicholas some symptoms of her father\u2019s irritability. However often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew, almost every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down to show him the French alphabet, she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child\u2014who was already afraid that Auntie might at any moment get angry\u2014that at his slightest inattention she trembled, became flustered and heated, raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner. Having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicholas, following her example, would sob, and without permission would leave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and comfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her father\u2019s irritability, which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water, it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this loving despot\u2014the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her\u2014knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame for everything.", " And His will is governed only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for our good. You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte! The case is this: my father\u2019s health is growing noticeably worse, he cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability is, as you know, chiefly directed to political questions. He cannot endure the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own, the grandson of the Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite indifferent to politics, but from my father\u2019s remarks and his talks with Michael Iv\u00e1novich I know all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte, who only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is not accepted as a great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my father cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable.", " We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty churches\u2014but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.\u201d So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it were something new. \u201cI understand the deception and confusion,\u201d he thought, \u201cbut how am I to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears that it must be so! But I\u2014what is to become of me?\u201d thought he. He had the unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he had to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them."], "Who incurs gambling debt as a young man, later takes responsibility for his family\u2019s debt, and is finally rescued from financial ruin by marrying Mary?": [" After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his parents. Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pult\u00fask and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the Emperor\u2019s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign. The P\u00e1vlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign. It had been neither at Pult\u00fask nor at Preussisch-Eylau and, when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign, was attached to Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s division. Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s division was acting independently of the main army. Several times parts of the P\u00e1vlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot\u2019s carriages. In April the P\u00e1vlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village. A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke, and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages, searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.", " She did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y, who was visiting them for the third time already. Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in the drawing room. \u201cMay I stay a little longer?\u201d he said, letting his stout body sink into an armchair beside her. \u201cOh yes,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou noticed nothing?\u201d her look asked. Pierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight before him and smiled quietly. \u201cHave you known that young man long, Princess?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cDrubetsk\u00f3y.\u201d \u201cNo, not long....\u201d \u201cDo you like him?\u201d \u201cYes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?\u201d said Princess Mary, still thinking of that morning\u2019s conversation with her father. \u201cBecause I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an heiress.\u201d \u201cYou have observed that?\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cYes,\u201d returned Pierre with a smile, \u201cand this young man now manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too. I can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay siege to\u2014you or Mademoiselle Julie Kar\u00e1gina. He is very attentive to her.\u201d \u201cHe visits them?\u201d \u201cYes, very often.", " He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancy\u2014as we were going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!\u201d repeated Nicholas, who at heart was not fond of Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski but was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad. \u201cStill, I am not the same as his own mother,\u201d said Countess Mary. \u201cI feel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am dreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions.\u201d \u201cWell it won\u2019t be for long. Next summer I\u2019ll take him to Petersburg,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cYes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,\u201d he continued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him. \u201cWell, what business is it of mine what goes on there\u2014whether Arakch\u00e9ev is bad, and all that? What business was it of mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with prison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it? And then there are you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night? No, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, and not to leave the children such beggars as I was.\u201d Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters.", " He was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by spoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He was not mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared about was gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others, he honestly considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues and bad people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high. Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of forgiveness. \u201cAll will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.\u201d D\u00f3lokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kur\u00e1gin and made use of him for his own ends. Anatole was sincerely fond of D\u00f3lokhov for his cleverness and audacity. D\u00f3lokhov, who needed Anatole Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s name, position, and connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it."], "Who is the one-eyed general who contrasts in temperament with Napoleon?": [" The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes\u2014it is their fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for another\u2014Bernadotte, who promptly went mad\u2014for no Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad.\u201d Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose. Balash\u00ebv knew how to reply to each of Napoleon\u2019s remarks, and would have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balash\u00ebv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balash\u00ebv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses. Balash\u00ebv stood with downcast eyes, looking at the movements of Napoleon\u2019s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes.", " As she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: \u201cPapa! Mamma\u2019s standing here!\u201d Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and his voice said crossly: \u201cI can\u2019t get a moment\u2019s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring him here?\u201d \u201cI only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....\u201d Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little black-eyed three-year-old Nat\u00e1sha, her father\u2019s pet, having learned from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs, and having examined the position of her father, who was asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face.", " Napoleon was silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him. Balash\u00ebv said that in Russia the best results were expected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, \u201cI know it\u2019s your duty to say that, but you don\u2019t believe it yourself. I have convinced you.\u201d When Balash\u00ebv had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon, without giving them a glance, turned to Balash\u00ebv: \u201cAssure the Emperor Alexander from me,\u201d said he, taking his hat, \u201cthat I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor.\u201d And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase. CHAPTER VII After all that Napoleon had said to him\u2014those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words: \u201cI will detain you no longer, General; you shall receive my letter,\u201d Balash\u00ebv felt convinced that Napoleon would not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him\u2014an insulted envoy\u2014especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But, to his surprise, Balash\u00ebv received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine with the Emperor that day.", " \u201cDo you know I have entrusted him with our secret?

Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day, dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed her hand for the last time. \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d she said in a tone that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in anything and only saying now and then, \u201cOh, why did he go away?\u201d But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face."], "Which character do many critics find to be a reflection of Tolstoy?": [" He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the Sem\u00ebnov regiment.\u201d It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity. What do these reproaches mean? Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I (the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813) flow from the same sources\u2014the circumstances of his birth, education, and life\u2014that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed? In what does the substance of those reproaches lie? It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I, standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception inseparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth\u2014that this character\u2014though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not accuse him of that)\u2014had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is, with books and lectures and with taking notes from them.", " He understood his wife\u2019s line of thought. \u201cPlat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev?\u201d he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely trying to imagine Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s opinion on the subject. \u201cHe would not have understood... yet perhaps he would.\u201d \u201cI love you awfully!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly said. \u201cAwfully, awfully!\u201d \u201cNo, he would not have approved,\u201d said Pierre, after reflection. \u201cWhat he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should have been proud to let him see us.

On the contrary, now is the best of all. If only you did not go away! Do you remember how we quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we quarreled about\u2014I don\u2019t even remember!\u201d \u201cAlways about the same thing,\u201d said Pierre with a smile. \u201cJealo...\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t say it!

After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg\u2019s proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere. In the family\u2019s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved V\u00e9ra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands. The old count felt this most. He would probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what his debts amounted to, or what dowry he could give V\u00e9ra. When his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three hundred serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold, and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to V\u00e9ra.", " \u201cHere is our commanding officer... ask him,\u201d and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts. Nat\u00e1sha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to meet the major. \u201cMay the wounded men stay in our house?\u201d she asked. The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile. \u201cWhich one do you want, Ma\u2019am\u2019selle?\u201d said he, screwing up his eyes and smiling. Nat\u00e1sha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection\u2014as if considering in how far the thing was possible\u2014replied in the affirmative. \u201cOh yes, why not? They may,\u201d he said. With a slight inclination of her head, Nat\u00e1sha stepped back quickly to M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer. \u201cThey may. He says they may!\u201d whispered Nat\u00e1sha. The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 yard, and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in Povarsk\u00e1ya Street. Nat\u00e1sha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard. \u201cYour Papa must be told, though,\u201d said M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna."], "Which intellectual advantage emotionally handicaps Andrew?": [" A third class of historians\u2014the so-called historians of culture\u2014following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events\u2014again take that force to be something quite different. They see it in what is called culture\u2014in mental activity. The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause. But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls people\u2019s actions, for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man, or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love. But even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filled\u2014admitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an idea\u2014history\u2019s essential question still remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians, another, newer force\u2014the idea\u2014is added, the connection of which with the masses needs explanation.", " Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity student, who now, Bolk\u00f3nski thought, held in his hands\u2014those plump white hands\u2014the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Sper\u00e1nski answered the old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud, Sper\u00e1nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign. Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Sper\u00e1nski rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cI had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,\u201d he said with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. \u201cI have known of you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much gossip and tittle-tattle.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cmy father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege.", " She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball. Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his friend\u2019s face. Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with his back to Nat\u00e1sha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend. \u201cSomething very important is happening between them,\u201d thought Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him neglect the game. After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing like that, and Pierre was released. Nat\u00e1sha on one side was talking with S\u00f3nya and Bor\u00eds, and V\u00e9ra with a subtle smile was saying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. V\u00e9ra, having noticed Prince Andrew\u2019s attentions to Nat\u00e1sha, decided that at a party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact. When Pierre went up to them he noticed that V\u00e9ra was being carried away by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him.", " It is possible to understand that Napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some effort one may even conceive that Napoleon together with other influences was the cause of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat Social, had the effect of making Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event. Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously, and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce, handicraft, gardening, or anything else you please. But why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand. Only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers (if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment, civilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning, and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory."], "Which of the following make Natasha Pierre\u2019s equal?": [" \u201cWell, are they all right?\u201d said the soldier with a smile. \u201cYou should do like this.\u201d He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the rag, and handed it to Pierre. \u201cThe potatoes are grand!\u201d he said once more. \u201cEat some like that!\u201d Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better. \u201cOh, I\u2019m all right,\u201d said he, \u201cbut why did they shoot those poor fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.\u201d \u201cTss, tt...!\u201d said the little man. \u201cAh, what a sin... what a sin!\u201d he added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: \u201cHow was it, sir, that you stayed in Moscow?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,\u201d replied Pierre. \u201cAnd how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?\u201d \u201cNo, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried me as an incendiary.\u201d \u201cWhere there\u2019s law there\u2019s injustice,\u201d put in the little man. \u201cAnd have you been here long?\u201d Pierre asked as he munched the last of the potato. \u201cI? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.\u201d \u201cWhy, are you a soldier then?\u201d \u201cYes, we are soldiers of the \u00c1psheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We weren\u2019t told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had no idea, never guessed at all.\u201d \u201cAnd do you feel sad here?\u201d Pierre inquired.", " In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rost\u00f3vs all saw Pierre\u2014or someone extraordinarily like him\u2014in a coachman\u2019s coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully touching Pierre\u2019s elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated, he recognized Nat\u00e1sha, and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical kindliness. \u201cPeter Kir\u00edlovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is wonderful!\u201d she cried, holding out her hand to him. \u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you like this?\u201d Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on. \u201cWhat is the matter, Count?\u201d asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone. \u201cWhat? What? Why? Don\u2019t ask me,\u201d said Pierre, and looked round at Nat\u00e1sha whose radiant, happy expression\u2014of which he was conscious without looking at her\u2014filled him with enchantment. \u201cAre you remaining in Moscow, then?\u201d Pierre hesitated.", " But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside Alexander\u2019s will\u2014such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Talleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian evidently decomposes Alexander\u2019s power into the components: Talleyrand, Chateaubriand, and the rest\u2014but the sum of the components, that is, the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Sta\u00ebl, and the others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand, Madame de Sta\u00ebl, and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted\u2014that is, how component forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A\u2014the historian is again obliged to fall back on power\u2014the force he had denied\u2014and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And that is just what the universal historians do, and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.

The peasant drivers, shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost all of them stared with na\u00efve, childlike curiosity at Pierre\u2019s white hat and green swallow-tail coat. Pierre\u2019s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill with its singers, surrounded Pierre\u2019s carriage and blocked the road. Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierre\u2019s head was the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his little horse. One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at Pierre."], "Which leader does Tolstoy present in most glowing light?": [" The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the faint light of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men standing before him, wearing aprons like the Rhetor\u2019s and holding swords in their hands pointed at his breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the swords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded again. \u201cNow thou hast seen the lesser light,\u201d uttered a voice. Then the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together: \u201cSic transit gloria mundi.\u201d Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President\u2019s chair sat a young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck. On his right sat the Italian abb\u00e9 whom Pierre had met at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s two years before. There were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kur\u00e1gins\u2019. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words of the President, who held a mallet in his hand.

(With this method of observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the direction he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the people\u2019s change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side, or even in the rear.) \u201cIf the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd.\u201d So say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of their age.", " Casually, while surveying the squadron, the Emperor\u2019s eyes met Rost\u00f3v\u2019s and rested on them for not more than two seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s soul (it seemed to Rost\u00f3v that he understood everything), at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and galloped on. The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve o\u2019clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action. This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had passed, the P\u00e1vlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau itself, a petty German town, Rost\u00f3v saw the Emperor again.

Some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa Iv\u00e1novna consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow, drove up to the porch. Nat\u00e1sha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to one another, laughing, and shouting. Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the old count\u2019s with a trotter from the Orl\u00f3v stud as shaft horse, the fourth was Nicholas\u2019 own with a short shaggy black shaft horse. Nicholas, in his old lady\u2019s dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.

She did not understand why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would say: \u201cWell, one more day and my grain and the peasants\u2019 will all be under cover.\u201d Still less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business.", " But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind (which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power\u2014and say plainly that that was the result of Napoleon\u2019s will. Speaking so, the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize.

A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away. The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation.

She finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents. They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a bright-blue S\u00e8vres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count\u2019s portrait on the lid which Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had long wished for such a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards. \u201cThank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,\u201d said she as she always did. \u201cBut best of all you have brought yourself back\u2014for I never saw anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away.

Though Pierre, Nat\u00e1sha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Den\u00edsov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess\u2014not that anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was dead and so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to remember\u2014yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit, and Pierre answered the countess\u2019 questions as to whether Prince Vas\u00edli had aged and whether Countess Mary Alex\u00e9evna had sent greetings and still thought of them, and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was indifferent.", " \u201cYes,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, \u201cbut with this little difference, that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me,\u201d he went on, \u201cif things depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow\u2019s battle will depend and not on those others....

In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him. \u201cA battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours, but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle, and we did lose it.", " Every event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others. For instance, Pierre\u2019s return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so. The servants\u2014the most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of life\u2014were glad of Pierre\u2019s return because they knew that when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays. The children and their governesses were glad of Pierre\u2019s return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did. He alone could play on the clavichord that \u00e9cossaise (his only piece) to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all. Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent, with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection. No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of contempt.", " So the boy also was happy that Pierre had arrived. The guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in. The grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully. The old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and especially that Nat\u00e1sha would now be herself again. Pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste to satisfy all their expectations. Though the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting his mother\u2014and brother-in-law\u2019s commissions, nor the dress material for a present to Bel\u00f3va, nor toys for his wife\u2019s nephews. In the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that Nat\u00e1sha asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive things."], "Tolstoy\u2019s characterizations of historical leaders present them as which of the following?": [" But in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have those leaders?

When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement. Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship\u2019s movement also. Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands. But examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many commands were issued, the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it, but as soon as an event occurs\u2014be it what it may\u2014then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events.", " And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers. Some historians\u2014those biographical and specialist historians already referred to\u2014in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons, and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power, and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power\u2014mere violence. Their theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history, has the inconvenience\u2014in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another\u2014that a Legitimist historian will prove that the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will prove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the real power, and that all the others were violations of power. Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children. Recognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them.", " So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability, what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life. CHAPTER XI History examines the manifestations of man\u2019s free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws. The recognition of man\u2019s free will as something capable of influencing historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy. That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws, that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law can exist, nor any conception of historical events. For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of man\u2019s will in the present moves in space, time, and dependence on cause. The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more evident are the laws of that movement."], "Tolstoy links death with which of the following experiences?": [" Is that true?\u201d \u201cBut I am three times as rich as before,\u201d returned Pierre. Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife\u2019s debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before. \u201cWhat I have certainly gained is freedom,\u201d he began seriously, but did not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic. \u201cAnd are you building?\u201d \u201cYes. Sav\u00e9lich says I must!\u201d \u201cTell me, you did not know of the countess\u2019 death when you decided to remain in Moscow?\u201d asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended. \u201cNo,\u201d answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning Princess Mary had given to his words. \u201cI heard of it in Or\u00ebl and you cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,\u201d he added quickly, glancing at Nat\u00e1sha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife, \u201cbut her death shocked me terribly. When two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and one\u2019s own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation! I am very, very sorry for her,\u201d he concluded, and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face. \u201cYes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,\u201d said Princess Mary.", " And that fear was the fear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in. Something not human\u2014death\u2014was breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it back\u2014to lock it was no longer possible\u2014but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and closed again. Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died. But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke. \u201cYes, it was death! I died\u2014and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!\u201d And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that strange lightness did not again leave him. When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, Nat\u00e1sha went up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at her strangely, not understanding. That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary\u2019s arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest Nat\u00e1sha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing.", " \u201cSit down and write out the order of the day for tomorrow. And you,\u201d he continued, addressing another, \u201cride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.\u201d While Kut\u00fazov was talking to Ra\u00e9vski and dictating the order of the day, Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given. Kut\u00fazov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to be written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive. And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains throughout an army one and the same temper, known as \u201cthe spirit of the army,\u201d and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s words, his order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of the army to the other. It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kut\u00fazov had said, but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in the commander in chief\u2019s soul as in that of every Russian. And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.", " They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break the silence, looked at Nat\u00e1sha and at Princess Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy. \u201cDo you take vodka, Count?\u201d asked Princess Mary, and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past. \u201cNow tell us about yourself,\u201d said she. \u201cOne hears such improbable wonders about you.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him. \u201cThey even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary Abr\u00e1movna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought to have happened, to me. Step\u00e1n Step\u00e1nych also instructed me how I ought to tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people invite me out and tell me all about myself.\u201d Nat\u00e1sha smiled and was on the point of speaking. \u201cWe have been told,\u201d Princess Mary interrupted her, \u201cthat you lost two millions in Moscow."], "Which of the following represents, for Tolstoy, the triumph of Russian spirit over European reason?": [" Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units (battles, campaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered. The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed than is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars. The French, retreating in 1812\u2014though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves\u2014congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up into small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers.", " This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection! NAPOLEON MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812 Kut\u00fazov replied: \u201cI should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit of my nation.\u201d But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking. During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tar\u00fatino, a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies\u2014both in spirit and in number\u2014as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston\u2019s mission; the abundance of provisions at Tar\u00fatino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at Tar\u00fatino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every soldier\u2019s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side.", " Nat\u00e1sha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to face \u201cUncle,\u201d and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her shoulders and struck an attitude. Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an \u00e9migr\u00e9e French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de ch\u00e2le * would, one would have supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that \u201cUncle\u201d had expected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and smiled triumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that had at first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her. * The French shawl dance. She did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision, that An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was in An\u00edsya and in An\u00edsya\u2019s father and mother and aunt, and in every Russian man and woman. \u201cWell, little countess; that\u2019s it\u2014come on!\u201d cried \u201cUncle,\u201d with a joyous laugh, having finished the dance. \u201cWell done, niece! Now a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you.", " The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon\u2019s army was the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the Russian army. Kut\u00fazov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at Tar\u00fatino and Vy\u00e1zma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army. But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kut\u00fazov. The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the French would take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover. Only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches. To that end Kut\u00fazov\u2019s activity was directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to V\u00edlna\u2014not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it. Kut\u00fazov felt and knew\u2014not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his Russian being\u2014what every Russian soldier felt: that the French were beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march, the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year."], "Tolstoy uses Pierre\u2019s name, as well as Platon\u2019s role, to comment on Russian attitudes toward ___.": [" Ever since the enemy\u2019s entry into Smol\u00e9nsk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of \u201cthe heart of Russia.\u201d Not only did it seem to him (as to all administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscow\u2019s inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority. Rostopch\u00edn was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.", " To Pierre\u2019s assurances that he was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his life. Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre\u2019s feelings were, the latter would probably have left him, but the man\u2019s animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre. \u201cA Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,\u201d said the officer, looking at Pierre\u2019s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger. \u201cI owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That is all I can say.\u201d There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the word) in the officer\u2019s voice, in the expression of his face and in his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the Frenchman\u2019s smile, pressed the hand held out to him. \u201cCaptain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,\u201d he introduced himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache. \u201cWill you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac\u2019s bullet in my body?\u201d Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing, began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.", " Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kut\u00fazov\u2019s calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen\u2019s proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the French right wing. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, \u201cI cannot approve of the count\u2019s plan. Moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military history supports that view. For instance...\u201d Kut\u00fazov seemed to reflect, searching for an example, then with a clear, na\u00efve look at Bennigsen he added: \u201cOh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy....\u201d There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all. The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said. During one of these pauses Kut\u00fazov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak. They all looked at him. \u201cWell, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken crockery,\u201d said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. \u201cGentlemen, I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,\u201d he paused, \u201cby the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country, order a retreat.\u201d After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.", " \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cTell Countess Rost\u00f3va that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is good.\u201d Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say anything, looked fixedly at him. \u201cI say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?\u201d asked Pierre, \u201cabout...\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d returned Prince Andrew hastily. \u201cI said that a fallen woman should be forgiven, but I didn\u2019t say I could forgive her. I can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cBut can this be compared...?\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: \u201cYes, ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but I am unable to follow in that gentleman\u2019s footsteps. If you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So you\u2019ll give her the packet?\u201d Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary. The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the Rost\u00f3vs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else. At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming evident."]}
