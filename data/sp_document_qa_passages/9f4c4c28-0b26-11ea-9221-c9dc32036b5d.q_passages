{"With a discussionof what topic does Anna Pavlovna Scherer open the novel?": [" Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, \u201cI am so delighted... Mamma\u2019s health... and Countess Apr\u00e1ksina...\u201d and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine\u2019s day, Count Bez\u00fakhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s reception. \u201cI am so sorry for the poor count,\u201d said the visitor. \u201cHe is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s distress some fifteen times. \u201cThat\u2019s what comes of a modern education,\u201d exclaimed the visitor.", " The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother\u2019s face, and he smiled slightly. \u201cAh, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear invalid?\u201d said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her. Prince Vas\u00edli stared at her and at Bor\u00eds questioningly and perplexed. Bor\u00eds bowed politely. Prince Vas\u00edli without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient. \u201cIs it possible?\u201d exclaimed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cOh, how awful! It is terrible to think.... This is my son,\u201d she added, indicating Bor\u00eds. \u201cHe wanted to thank you himself.\u201d Bor\u00eds bowed again politely. \u201cBelieve me, Prince, a mother\u2019s heart will never forget what you have done for us.\u201d \u201cI am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna whom he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Sch\u00e9rer\u2019s reception.", " As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. \u201cIt seems to be all right,\u201d Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna.", " Each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters. Nat\u00e1sha, who, of the whole family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, that it had something to do with her brother, and that Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as she was, Nat\u00e1sha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nik\u00f3lenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess\u2019 remarks. After dinner, she rushed headlong after Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room."], "What is VasiliKuragin interested in obtaining for his son Anatole?": [" \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room. \u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room. Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety. Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him.", " D\u00f3lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an ironic smile: \u201cDo you know? You\u2019d really better drop it all. There\u2019s still time!\u201d \u201cFool,\u201d retorted Anatole. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! If you only knew... it\u2019s the devil knows what!\u201d \u201cNo, really, give it up!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI am speaking seriously. It\u2019s no joke, this plot you\u2019ve hatched.\u201d \u201cWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?\u201d said Anatole, making a grimace. \u201cReally it\u2019s no time for your stupid jokes,\u201d and he left the room. D\u00f3lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out. \u201cYou wait a bit,\u201d he called after him. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, I\u2019m talking sense. Come here, come here!\u201d Anatole returned and looked at D\u00f3lokhov, trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily. \u201cNow listen to me. I\u2019m telling you this for the last time. Why should I joke about it? Did I hinder you?", " \u201cNow then! Nearly ready? You\u2019re dawdling!\u201d he shouted to the servants. D\u00f3lokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into the room where Khv\u00f3stikov and Mak\u00e1rin were sitting. Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself. \u201cCome and eat something. Have a drink!\u201d D\u00f3lokhov shouted to him from the other room. \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d answered Anatole continuing to smile. \u201cCome! Balag\u00e1 is here.\u201d Anatole rose and went into the dining room. Balag\u00e1 was a famous troyka driver who had known D\u00f3lokhov and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole\u2019s regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again the next night.", " She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either. \u201cNot at all bad!\u201d he thought, examining her, \u201cnot at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we\u2019re married, la petite est gentille.\u201d * * The little one is charming. The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. \u201cWhat are Prince Vas\u00edli and that son of his to me? Prince Vas\u00edli is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,\u201d he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself."], "In what centuryis War and Peace set?": [" He paced up and down a few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking. \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous.", " \u201cGo your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of honor!\u201d He paused. \u201cI missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to send.\u201d And changing the subject, Kut\u00fazov began to speak of the Turkish war and the peace that had been concluded. \u201cYes, I have been much blamed,\u201d he said, \u201cboth for that war and the peace... but everything came at the right time. Tout vient \u00e0 point \u00e0 celui qui sait attendre. * And there were as many advisers there as here...\u201d he went on, returning to the subject of \u201cadvisers\u201d which evidently occupied him. \u201cAh, those advisers!\u201d said he. \u201cIf we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. K\u00e1menski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign.", " \u201cFrom the height of the Kr\u00e9mlin\u2014yes, there is the Kr\u00e9mlin, yes\u2014I will give them just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not, and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch. \u2018Boyars,\u2019 I will say to them, \u2018I do not desire war, I desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects.\u2019 However, I know their presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do: clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in Moscow? Yes, there she lies.\u201d \u201cQu\u2019on m\u2019am\u00e8ne les boyars,\u201d * said he to his suite. * \u201cBring the boyars to me.\u201d A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars.", " \u201cThere, that\u2019s me!\u201d the expression of her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. \u201cWell, and very nice too! I need nobody.\u201d A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite mood\u2014love of, and delight in, herself. \u201cHow charming that Nat\u00e1sha is!\u201d she said again, speaking as some third, collective, male person. \u201cPretty, a good voice, young, and in nobody\u2019s way if only they leave her in peace.\u201d But however much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace, and immediately felt this. In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, \u201cAt home?\u201d and then footsteps were heard. Nat\u00e1sha was looking at the mirror, but did not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors."], "What is Pierre\u2019smost noticeable physical feature?": [" \u201cCome, let\u2019s argue then,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cYou talk of schools,\u201d he went on, crooking a finger, \u201ceducation and so forth; that is, you want to raise him\u201d (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap) \u201cfrom his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of. I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my means. Then you say, \u2018lighten his toil.\u2019 But as I see it, physical labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as mental activity is to you or me. You can\u2019t help thinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I can\u2019t sleep but toss about till dawn, because I think and can\u2019t help thinking, just as he can\u2019t help plowing and mowing; if he didn\u2019t, he would go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and die.", " And Pierre, without trying to change the other\u2019s views and without condemning him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon. There was a new feature in Pierre\u2019s relations with Willarski, with the princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man\u2019s convictions by words, and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing things each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other people. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between men\u2019s opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.", " Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to Volk\u00f3nski in Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence. Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry, determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present, evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon\u2019s genius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other\u2019s proposals.", " \u201cGo on, you must drink it all,\u201d said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, \u201cor I won\u2019t let you go!\u201d \u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window. D\u00f3lokhov was holding the Englishman\u2019s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre. D\u00f3lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face."], "Who is the ownerof the estate called Bald Hills?": [" Rost\u00f3v was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ily\u00edn; he let Lavr\u00fashka have another horse and took him along with him. CHAPTER VIII Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew supposed. After the return of Alp\u00e1tych from Smol\u00e9nsk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief\u2019s discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia\u2019s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills. But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguch\u00e1rovo and thence to Moscow.", " \u201cIt is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,\u201d said she. Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vas\u00edli she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret. CHAPTER XXV At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andr\u00e9evich Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s estate, the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince\u2019s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andr\u00e9evich (nicknamed in society, \u201cthe King of Prussia\u201d) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing.", " In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating to buy back Otr\u00e1dnoe\u2014that being his pet dream. Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products, and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate. He always had before his mind\u2019s eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made effective\u2014the peasant laborer.", " But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel\u2019s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: \u201cAh, why have you done this to me?\u201d Soon after Prince Andrew\u2019s return the old prince made over to him a large estate, Boguch\u00e1rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father\u2019s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Boguch\u00e1rovo, began building and spent most of his time there. After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service."], "Who is severelywounded at the Battle of Austerlitz?": [" This procrastinator Kut\u00fazov, whose motto was \u201cPatience and Time,\u201d this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodin\u00f3, investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kut\u00fazov who before the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodin\u00f3 was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought, and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia crossed. It is easy now to understand the significance of these events\u2014if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals\u2014for the events and results now lie before us.", " The gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood from this official report that our army had been defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kut\u00fazov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son. \u201cYour son,\u201d wrote Kut\u00fazov, \u201cfell before my eyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of a regiment\u2014he fell as a hero, worthy of his father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.\u201d After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.", " Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house in Petersburg were Bor\u00eds, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and paid the eldest daughter, Countess V\u00e9ra, the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose. Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had obtained two decorations for Austerlitz. In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also.", " Buxh\u00f6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle \u2018on his own hand\u2019 as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pult\u00fask, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pult\u00fask. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxh\u00f6wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers."], "Who is Pierre\u2019sfirst wife?": [" At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s wife, sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife. \u201cNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame,\u201d he thought. If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not?", " The general opinion was that Pierre was under his wife\u2019s thumb, which was really true. From the very first days of their married life Nat\u00e1sha had announced her demands. Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife\u2019s view, to him a perfectly novel one, that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family. His wife\u2019s demands astonished him, but they also flattered him, and he submitted to them. Pierre\u2019s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on business\u2014in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose.", " Involuntarily recalling his wife\u2019s past and her relations with D\u00f3lokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife. He involuntarily remembered how D\u00f3lokhov, who had fully recovered his former position after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion, D\u00f3lokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had smilingly expressed disapproval of D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s living at their house, and how cynically D\u00f3lokhov had praised his wife\u2019s beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day. \u201cYes, he is very handsome,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cand I know him. It would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him, and helped him.", " Toward him Bor\u00eds behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade of deference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition, first by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect. \u201cNo, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced her former infatuations,\u201d he told himself. \u201cThere has never been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the heart\u201d\u2014a statement which, though gathered from an unknown source, he believed implicitly. Yet strange to say Bor\u00eds\u2019 presence in his wife\u2019s drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a physical effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements. \u201cWhat a strange antipathy,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cyet I used to like him very much.\u201d In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow."], "With which manis it rumored Pierre\u2019s wife is having an affair?": [" At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s wife, sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife. \u201cNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame,\u201d he thought. If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not?", " Fancy! The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vas\u00edli nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bez\u00fakhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince Vas\u00edli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen. I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bez\u00fakhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don\u2019t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bez\u00fakhova.", " The general opinion was that Pierre was under his wife\u2019s thumb, which was really true. From the very first days of their married life Nat\u00e1sha had announced her demands. Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife\u2019s view, to him a perfectly novel one, that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family. His wife\u2019s demands astonished him, but they also flattered him, and he submitted to them. Pierre\u2019s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on business\u2014in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose.", " It was they, these soldiers\u2014wounded and unwounded\u2014it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To rid himself of them he closed his eyes. For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand, S\u00f3nya\u2019s thin little shoulders, Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s eyes and laughter, Den\u00edsov with his voice and mustache, and Tely\u00e1nin and all that affair with Tely\u00e1nin and Bogd\u00e1nich. That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair\u2019s breadth. It would not ache\u2014it would be well\u2014if only they did not pull it, but it was impossible to get rid of them."], "What topic doesthe mysterious stranger Pierre encounters at the Torzhok stationdiscuss?": [" \u201cYou are unhappy, my dear sir,\u201d the stranger continued. \u201cYou are young and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my power.\u201d \u201cOh, yes!\u201d said Pierre, with a forced smile. \u201cI am very grateful to you. Where are you traveling from?\u201d The stranger\u2019s face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to Pierre. \u201cBut if for any reason you don\u2019t feel inclined to talk to me,\u201d said the old man, \u201csay so, my dear sir.\u201d And he suddenly smiled, in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way. \u201cOh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your acquaintance,\u201d said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger\u2019s hands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull\u2014a Masonic sign. \u201cAllow me to ask,\u201d he said, \u201care you a Mason?\u201d \u201cYes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,\u201d said the stranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierre\u2019s eyes.", " Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this stranger. The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be wanted. * To indicate he did not want more tea. \u201cNo. Give me the book,\u201d said the stranger. The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work, and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again, leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and severe gaze straight on Pierre\u2019s face. Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old eyes attracted him irresistibly.", " The stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a death\u2019s head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache, evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown. This active old servant was unpacking the traveler\u2019s canteen and preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom he passed it.", " CHAPTER II \u201cI have the pleasure of addressing Count Bez\u00fakhov, if I am not mistaken,\u201d said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice. Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles. \u201cI have heard of you, my dear sir,\u201d continued the stranger, \u201cand of your misfortune.\u201d He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to say\u2014\u201cYes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.\u201d\u2014\u201cI regret it very much, my dear sir.\u201d Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile. \u201cI have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for greater reasons.\u201d He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him."], "For what misdeedis Nicholas\u2019s friend Denisov in danger of being court-martialed?": [" A judge of horses and a sportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Don\u00e9ts horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor\u2019s wife, but not once of the impending danger. Formerly, when going into action, Rost\u00f3v had felt afraid; now he had not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him\u2014the impending danger. During the first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time it had come of itself.", " CHAPTER XVII After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the Emperor\u2019s stay was the call for contributions of men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable. With the enemy\u2019s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites\u2019 view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it; the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger, since it is not in man\u2019s power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to think about what is pleasant.", " \u201cWell, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when we were retreating from Sventsy\u00e1ni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all; wasn\u2019t it so, your excellency?\u201d and again Tim\u00f3khin turned to the prince. \u201cBut we daren\u2019t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became straightforward. Now we see light....\u201d \u201cThen why was it forbidden?\u201d Tim\u00f3khin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew. \u201cWhy, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy,\u201d said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. \u201cIt is very sound: one can\u2019t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding. At Smol\u00e9nsk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us, as they had larger forces.", " Rost\u00f3v noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed, gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed T\u00fashin still listened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading, the Uhlan interrupted Den\u00edsov. \u201cBut what I say is,\u201d he said, turning to Rost\u00f3v, \u201cit would be best simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards will now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....\u201d \u201cMe petition the Empewo\u2019!\u201d exclaimed Den\u00edsov, in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence. \u201cWhat for? If I were a wobber I would ask mercy, but I\u2019m being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers to book. Let them twy me, I\u2019m not afwaid of anyone."], "How does Nicholasrescue Mary?": [" Tell me, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!\u201d he added after a pause, and touched her hand as she did not reply. \u201cI am thinking of what you have told me,\u201d answered Princess Mary. \u201cThis is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at present...\u201d Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in Nat\u00e1sha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for. \u201cTo speak to her now wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said the princess all the same. \u201cBut what am I to do?\u201d \u201cLeave it to me,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI know...\u201d Pierre was looking into Princess Mary\u2019s eyes. \u201cWell?... Well?...\u201d he said. \u201cI know that she loves... will love you,\u201d Princess Mary corrected herself. Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized Princess Mary\u2019s hand.", " But how? What is her mind like? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\u2019s hand to herself, \u201cMary, you mustn\u2019t think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you! Let us be quite, quite friends.\u201d And Nat\u00e1sha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings. From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha. They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together. When one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other\u2019s presence.", " Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat\u00e1sha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother\u2019s bedroom had strained Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s physical strength. One afternoon noticing Nat\u00e1sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Nat\u00e1sha lay down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\u201d \u201cYou are tired\u2014try to sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\u201d \u201cShe is much better. She spoke so well today,\u201d said Princess Mary. Nat\u00e1sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned Princess Mary\u2019s face. \u201cIs she like him?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYes, like and yet not like. But she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What is in her heart? All that is good.", " \u201cMary Bogd\u00e1novna, I think it\u2019s beginning!\u201d said Princess Mary looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm. \u201cWell, the Lord be thanked, Princess,\u201d said Mary Bogd\u00e1novna, not hastening her steps. \u201cYou young ladies should not know anything about it.\u201d \u201cBut how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?\u201d said the princess. (In accordance with Lise\u2019s and Prince Andrew\u2019s wishes they had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any moment.) \u201cNo matter, Princess, don\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d said Mary Bogd\u00e1novna. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage very well without a doctor.\u201d Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the large leather sofa from Prince Andrew\u2019s study into the bedroom. On their faces was a quiet and solemn look. Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching what was going on in the passage."], "What does Pierremadly and briefly imagine his mission in life to be?": [" Kut\u00fazov, who was already weary of Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly. Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way, being only two miles off the Smol\u00e9nsk highroad. During the last three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat older.", " But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does not and cannot believe this. However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would be unable to live for a single moment.", " Thanks to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s efforts, his own tastes, and the peculiarities of his reserved nature, Bor\u00eds had managed during his service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so pleased at Olm\u00fctz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to understand these things. In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were completely altered.", " And the troops retired one more, last, day\u2019s march, and abandoned Moscow to the enemy. For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals\u2014as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle\u2014the questions present themselves: Why did Kut\u00fazov during the retreat not do this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Fil\u00ed? Why did he not retire at once by the Kal\u00faga road, abandoning Moscow? and so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know, the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our plans from some given moment."], "How does Heleneattempt to marry another man while still wedded to Pierre?": [" \u201cNever, never marry, my dear fellow!

Owing to the count\u2019s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to come from their Ryaz\u00e1n and Moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth. From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodin\u00f3 were brought in by the Dorogom\u00edlov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow, and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates.", " As to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count.", " When they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do. The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be arrested.", " In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices. From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on him\u2014as if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to receive impressions that might weaken it. The women\u2019s vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts, more soldiers, and now and then women. Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement. All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power."], "According tothe narrator of War and Peace, which of the following best describesthe Battle of Borodino?": [" He paced up and down a few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking. \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous.", " Then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel. The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event. After the burning of Smol\u00e9nsk a war began which did not follow any previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodin\u00f3 and the renewed retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.", " \u201cGo your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of honor!\u201d He paused. \u201cI missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to send.\u201d And changing the subject, Kut\u00fazov began to speak of the Turkish war and the peace that had been concluded. \u201cYes, I have been much blamed,\u201d he said, \u201cboth for that war and the peace... but everything came at the right time. Tout vient \u00e0 point \u00e0 celui qui sait attendre. * And there were as many advisers there as here...\u201d he went on, returning to the subject of \u201cadvisers\u201d which evidently occupied him. \u201cAh, those advisers!\u201d said he. \u201cIf we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. K\u00e1menski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign.", " Buxh\u00f6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle \u2018on his own hand\u2019 as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pult\u00fask, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pult\u00fask. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxh\u00f6wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers."], "In what publicplace does Natasha become interested in Anatole?": [" \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room. \u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room. Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety. Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him.", " D\u00f3lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an ironic smile: \u201cDo you know? You\u2019d really better drop it all. There\u2019s still time!\u201d \u201cFool,\u201d retorted Anatole. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! If you only knew... it\u2019s the devil knows what!\u201d \u201cNo, really, give it up!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI am speaking seriously. It\u2019s no joke, this plot you\u2019ve hatched.\u201d \u201cWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?\u201d said Anatole, making a grimace. \u201cReally it\u2019s no time for your stupid jokes,\u201d and he left the room. D\u00f3lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out. \u201cYou wait a bit,\u201d he called after him. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, I\u2019m talking sense. Come here, come here!\u201d Anatole returned and looked at D\u00f3lokhov, trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily. \u201cNow listen to me. I\u2019m telling you this for the last time. Why should I joke about it? Did I hinder you?", " \u201cNow then! Nearly ready? You\u2019re dawdling!\u201d he shouted to the servants. D\u00f3lokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into the room where Khv\u00f3stikov and Mak\u00e1rin were sitting. Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself. \u201cCome and eat something. Have a drink!\u201d D\u00f3lokhov shouted to him from the other room. \u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d answered Anatole continuing to smile. \u201cCome! Balag\u00e1 is here.\u201d Anatole rose and went into the dining room. Balag\u00e1 was a famous troyka driver who had known D\u00f3lokhov and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas.

Pierre felt it strange to see this calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home. Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\u00f3lokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see Nat\u00e1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\u2019s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The countess\u2019 drawing room was full of guests. Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return\u2014at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever\u2014entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him."], "For what doesthe dying Count Rostov beg forgiveness?": [" To whom?... Nonsense!\u201d cried the count, suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do. \u201cI promised to pay tomorrow,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cWell!...\u201d said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa. \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped! It happens to everyone!\u201d said the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father\u2019s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone! The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\u2019s words and began bustlingly searching for something. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he muttered, \u201cit will be difficult, I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\u201d And with a furtive glance at his son\u2019s face, the count went out of the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all expected this.", " Nat\u00e1sha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright and cheerful. When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with Pierre, Nat\u00e1sha met her on the threshold. \u201cHe has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?\u201d she repeated. And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face. \u201cI wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.\u201d Understandable and touching as the look with which Nat\u00e1sha gazed at her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation, these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his love. \u201cBut what\u2019s to be done? She can\u2019t help it,\u201d thought the princess. And with a sad and rather stern look she told Nat\u00e1sha all that Pierre had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Nat\u00e1sha was astounded.", " The Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French, also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards.

We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty churches\u2014but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.\u201d So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it were something new.", " During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vas\u00edli left the chair on which he had been leaning, and\u2014with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them\u2014did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vas\u00edli and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential. The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament."], "Who is Mary\u2019sbrother?": [" Tell me, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!\u201d he added after a pause, and touched her hand as she did not reply. \u201cI am thinking of what you have told me,\u201d answered Princess Mary. \u201cThis is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at present...\u201d Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in Nat\u00e1sha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for. \u201cTo speak to her now wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said the princess all the same. \u201cBut what am I to do?\u201d \u201cLeave it to me,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI know...\u201d Pierre was looking into Princess Mary\u2019s eyes. \u201cWell?... Well?...\u201d he said. \u201cI know that she loves... will love you,\u201d Princess Mary corrected herself.

Yes, she is splendid!\u201d \u201cMary,\u201d she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\u2019s hand to herself, \u201cMary, you mustn\u2019t think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you! Let us be quite, quite friends.\u201d And Nat\u00e1sha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings. From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha. They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together. When one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other\u2019s presence.", " Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat\u00e1sha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother\u2019s bedroom had strained Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s physical strength. One afternoon noticing Nat\u00e1sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Nat\u00e1sha lay down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\u201d \u201cYou are tired\u2014try to sleep.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\u201d \u201cShe is much better. She spoke so well today,\u201d said Princess Mary. Nat\u00e1sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned Princess Mary\u2019s face. \u201cIs she like him?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYes, like and yet not like.

(In accordance with Lise\u2019s and Prince Andrew\u2019s wishes they had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any moment.) \u201cNo matter, Princess, don\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d said Mary Bogd\u00e1novna. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage very well without a doctor.\u201d Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the large leather sofa from Prince Andrew\u2019s study into the bedroom. On their faces was a quiet and solemn look. Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching what was going on in the passage."], "What good deedends up getting Pierre captured by the French?": [" There were also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there was Vas\u00edlisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of the French. The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves, amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded and captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling, hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the end of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what could not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and moving according to rules at a distance from the French, still regarded many things as impossible.", " For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity, goodness, and truth are absent. CHAPTER XIX What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret, dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate) the aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and capture them all? How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the French had given battle at Borodin\u00f3, did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture them?", " \u201cWhat is it, Nat\u00e1sha?\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d She smiled at Pierre through her tears. \u201cGood night! It is time for bed.\u201d Pierre rose and took his leave. Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of Pierre nor did Nat\u00e1sha speak of him. \u201cWell, good night, Mary!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cDo you know, I am often afraid that by not speaking of him\u201d (she meant Prince Andrew) \u201cfor fear of not doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.\u201d Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s remark, but she did not express agreement in words. \u201cIs it possible to forget?\u201d said she. \u201cIt did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and painful, but good, very good!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cI am sure he really loved him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?\u201d she added, suddenly blushing.", " But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the new guard\u2014both officers and men\u2014he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason by order of the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer. All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as he spoke French."], "What causes Petya\u2019sdeath?": [" Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows. The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription.", " The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war.", " Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as its problem. The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self-destruction toward which\u2014ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena\u2014the old method of history is moving. All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all unknown, infinitely small, elements.", " BOOK THIRTEEN: 1812 CHAPTER I Man\u2019s mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man\u2019s soul.

There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city. The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme f\u00e9roce de Rostopch\u00edne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality, however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible for it.", " Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King desires to arrest their course.

Its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm. The city police is established on its former footing, and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city.", " Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor bring them the keys of the city. CHAPTER XXVII The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it did, only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the second of September. After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances, Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely obsessed by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past, understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream.

If we\u2019re punished, it means that we have deserved it, it\u2019s not for us to judge. If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no God\u2014nothing!\u201d shouted Nicholas, banging the table\u2014very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts. \u201cOur business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That\u2019s all....\u201d said he. \u201cAnd to drink,\u201d said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel. \u201cYes, and to drink,\u201d assented Nicholas. \u201cHullo there! Another bottle!\u201d he shouted. In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.", " But the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible. And I,\u201d continued Pierre, \u201cshot D\u00f3lokhov because I considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they considered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who executed him\u2014also for some reason. What is bad? What is good? What should one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am I? What is life, and what is death? What power governs all?\u201d There was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was: \u201cYou\u2019ll die and all will end. You\u2019ll die and know all, or cease asking.\u201d But dying was also dreadful. The Torzh\u00f3k peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her wares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. \u201cI have hundreds of rubles I don\u2019t know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered cloak looking timidly at me,\u201d he thought.", " \u201cDen\u00edsov, don\u2019t make fun of it!\u201d cried Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIt is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...\u201d \u201cI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...\u201d \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d And Rost\u00f3v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to die\u2014not in saving the Emperor\u2019s life (he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms.

Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.

The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined. For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs. Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles. It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man\u2019s subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it.

She blushed for him, grew still angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The princess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him to stay longer at Anna Sem\u00ebnovna\u2019s, and he departed.

Nat\u00e1sha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom, by her father\u2019s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess who\u2014she thought\u2014was making a favor of receiving her, and so everything displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom she thought very plain, affected, and dry.", " To strain the facts to fit the rules of history: to say that the field of battle at Borodin\u00f3 remained in the hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles that destroyed Napoleon\u2019s army, is impossible. After the French victory at Borodin\u00f3 there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China, we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the historians\u2019 usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards); if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event occurred before our fathers\u2019 eyes, and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of all known wars. The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodin\u00f3 to the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.", " But this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed. CHAPTER XXVIII Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodin\u00f3 because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of one man\u2014Peter the Great\u2014and that France from a republic became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one man\u2014Napoleon\u2014to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing. If it had depended on Napoleon\u2019s will to fight or not to fight the battle of Borodin\u00f3, and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been the savior of Russia.", " You command only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy.

If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery. The Russian Emperor\u2019s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor. NAPOLEON Bonaparte\u2019s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to Murat.

You should not think so.\u201d \u201cThink? What about?\u201d asked Prince Andrew with surprise. \u201cAbout life, about man\u2019s destiny. It can\u2019t be so. I myself thought like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don\u2019t smile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, aspects of humanity.\u201d And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood, and love. \u201cOnly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest is a dream,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cUnderstand, my dear fellow, that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others.", " Ah, friend\u2014my pink one is delicious; her name is Duny\u00e1sha....\u201d But on glancing at Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face Ily\u00edn stopped short. He saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought. Rost\u00f3v glanced angrily at Ily\u00edn and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village. \u201cI\u2019ll show them; I\u2019ll give it to them, the brigands!\u201d said he to himself. Alp\u00e1tych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with him with difficulty. \u201cWhat decision have you been pleased to come to?\u201d said he. Rost\u00f3v stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on Alp\u00e1tych. \u201cDecision? What decision? Old dotard!...\u201d cried he. \u201cWhat have you been about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can\u2019t manage them? You\u2019re a traitor yourself! I know you. I\u2019ll flay you all alive!...\u201d And as if afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alp\u00e1tych and went rapidly forward.", " In the first he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of the order: with questions of the threefold designation of God, the three primordial elements\u2014sulphur, mercury, and salt\u2014or the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph Alex\u00e9evich himself, but he did not share their interests. His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry. In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him, seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so. In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance.", " Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master of the principal lodge. Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged, particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre\u2019s observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge. Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order. In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg."], "Who is defeated in a decisive battle at Borodino?": [" This procrastinator Kut\u00fazov, whose motto was \u201cPatience and Time,\u201d this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodin\u00f3, investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kut\u00fazov who before the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodin\u00f3 was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought, and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia crossed. It is easy now to understand the significance of these events\u2014if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals\u2014for the events and results now lie before us.", " At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled. He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief\u2019s undivided control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsar\u00e9vich, and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these \u201ceyes of the Emperor,\u201d became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle. Barclay stood for caution.", " Now the decisive moment of battle had come when Kut\u00fazov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kut\u00fazov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow\u2019s action, and new men would come to the front. So Bor\u00eds was full of nervous vivacity all day. After Kays\u00e1rov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces\u2014an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death.", " Buxh\u00f6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle \u2018on his own hand\u2019 as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pult\u00fask, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pult\u00fask. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxh\u00f6wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers."], "Pierre decides he is destined to do what?": [" And with that object he had asked Ger\u00e1sim to get him a peasant\u2019s coat and a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph Alex\u00e9evich\u2019s house and keeping his name secret. Then during the first day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his attention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection with Bonaparte\u2019s more than once vaguely presented itself. But the idea that he, L\u2019russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and left no trace behind. When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the Rost\u00f3vs and Nat\u00e1sha had said to him: \u201cAre you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!\u201d the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing, even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was predestined to do.", " He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night\u2019s experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed the Arb\u00e1t more than four hours previously on his way from the Dorogom\u00edlov suburb to the Kr\u00e9mlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Kr\u00e9mlin, giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him, and was tortured\u2014as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures\u2014by the fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.", " But it will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take it!\u2019 \u2018Yes, let\u2019s!\u2019 say the others. And off they go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.\u201d * The marshalls. \u201cStop jesting,\u201d said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news grieved him and yet he was pleased. As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame! Listening to Bil\u00edbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.", " But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man\u2019s mind. One terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The question for him now was: \u201cHave I really allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Pl\u00e1tov to retreat, or was it the evening before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must be given.\u201d To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince Prozor\u00f3vski, under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against the Emperor\u2019s wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen commander in chief."], "The novel ends with which of the following?": [" \u201cAnd what does she want the money for? As if that money could add a hair\u2019s breadth to happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death?\u2014death which ends all and must come today or tomorrow\u2014at any rate, in an instant as compared with eternity.\u201d And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread, and again it turned uselessly in the same place. His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. \u201cAnd why did she resist her seducer when she loved him?\u201d he thought. \u201cGod could not have put into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife\u2014as she once was\u2014did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been found out, nothing discovered,\u201d Pierre again said to himself. \u201cAll we can know is that we know nothing.", " \u201cGo on!\u201d he ordered his coachman. The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap. The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared look, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their speed. \u201cIt\u2019s a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!\u201d shouted the tall youth. \u201cDon\u2019t let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!\u201d shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap. Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of the Luby\u00e1nka Street. \u201cThere now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to perish. Do they think we\u2019re dogs?\u201d voices in the crowd were heard saying more and more frequently. CHAPTER XXIV On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with Kut\u00fazov, Count Rostopch\u00edn had returned to Moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and because Kut\u00fazov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters.", " \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what to do,\u201d he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not reply: \u201cI will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, mon cher,\u201d he paused, \u201cabstiens-toi\u201d *(2)\u2014he articulated the French proverb deliberately. * \u201cDon\u2019t see it that way, that\u2019s the trouble.\u201d * (2) \u201cWhen in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.\u201d \u201cWell, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince, nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.\u201d Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter had left the room Kut\u00fazov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis. Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that interview with Kut\u00fazov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted.", " The unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently. He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there. CHAPTER XI Prince Andrew\u2019s eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolk\u00f3nski, but not pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign. Chern\u00fdshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor, who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak."], "At the society party, Anna refers to whom as \u201cthe Antichrist\u201d?": [" But I warn you, if you don\u2019t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist\u2014I really believe he is Antichrist\u2014I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my \u2018faithful slave,\u2019 as you call yourself!

With these words she greeted Prince Vas\u00edli Kur\u00e1gin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna P\u00e1vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite. All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows: \u201cIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10\u2014Annette Sch\u00e9rer.\u201d \u201cHeavens!", " The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from V\u00edlna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagrati\u00f3n, Erm\u00f3lov (who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a famous joke of Erm\u00f3lov\u2019s was being circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering Suv\u00f3rov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia, and not let the army get discouraged. To the third party\u2014in which the Emperor had most confidence\u2014belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two.", " No independent men, such as you or I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the mot d\u2019ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well!\u201d Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more. \u201cBut action with what aim?\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd what position will you adopt toward the government?\u201d \u201cWhy, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but it is a society of true conservatives\u2014a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some Pugach\u00ebv or other from killing my children and yours, and Arakch\u00e9ev from sending me off to some Military Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety.\u201d \u201cYes, but it\u2019s a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm.\u201d \u201cWhy?", " I said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees. And how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold all that has happened.\u201d Anna P\u00e1vlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees as before\u2014such as she alone had the gift of arranging\u2014at which was to be found \u201cthe cream of really good society, the bloom of the intellectual essence of Petersburg,\u201d as she herself put it. Besides this refined selection of society Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s receptions were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court society so dearly and distinctly indicated. Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon\u2019s destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt and the surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon was beginning, Anna P\u00e1vlovna gave one of her soirees."], "In a conversation with Andrew, Pierre expresses a belief in the possibility of what?": [" The conversation was about Sper\u00e1nski\u2014the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow. \u201cNow he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago,\u201d Prince Andrew was saying, \u201cand by those who were unable to understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other men\u2019s mistakes is very easy, but I maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him, by him alone.\u201d He paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression. \u201cPosterity will do him justice,\u201d he concluded, and at once turned to Pierre. \u201cWell, how are you? Still getting stouter?\u201d he said with animation, but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. \u201cYes, I am well,\u201d he said in answer to Pierre\u2019s question, and smiled. To Pierre that smile said plainly: \u201cI am well, but my health is now of no use to anyone.\u201d After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his son\u2019s tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about Sper\u00e1nski which was still going on between the two old men.", " \u201cHe could not marry, for he was married already,\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father. \u201cAnd where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?\u201d he said. \u201cHe has gone to Peters... But I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cTell Countess Rost\u00f3va that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is good.\u201d Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say anything, looked fixedly at him. \u201cI say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?\u201d asked Pierre, \u201cabout...\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d returned Prince Andrew hastily. \u201cI said that a fallen woman should be forgiven, but I didn\u2019t say I could forgive her. I can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cBut can this be compared...?\u201d said Pierre. Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: \u201cYes, ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?...", " They described the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation. The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined. For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs. Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles. It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man\u2019s subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this.", " Let us have dinner, and then we\u2019ll set off.\u201d At dinner, conversation turned on Pierre\u2019s marriage. \u201cI was very much surprised when I heard of it,\u201d said Prince Andrew. Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said hurriedly: \u201cI will tell you some time how it all happened. But you know it is all over, and forever.\u201d \u201cForever?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cNothing\u2019s forever.\u201d \u201cBut you know how it all ended, don\u2019t you? You heard of the duel?\u201d \u201cAnd so you had to go through that too!\u201d \u201cOne thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cWhy so?\u201d asked Prince Andrew. \u201cTo kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really.\u201d \u201cNo, to kill a man is bad\u2014wrong.\u201d \u201cWhy is it wrong?\u201d urged Prince Andrew. \u201cIt is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will err, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.\u201d \u201cWhat does harm to another is wrong,\u201d said Pierre, feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state."], "When Natasha appears, what is she carrying?": [" Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God. What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of man\u2019s freedom? That is a question for theology. The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics. What is man\u2019s responsibility to society, the conception of which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for jurisprudence. Man\u2019s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a question for ethics. Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded\u2014as the result of the free, or as the result of the constrained, activity of man?", " The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war.", " Thanks for the fire\u2014we\u2019ll return it with interest,\u201d said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick. Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed by the fire. One of them stumbled. \u201cWho the devil has put the logs on the road?\u201d snarled he. \u201cHe\u2019s dead\u2014why carry him?\u201d said another. \u201cShut up!\u201d And they disappeared into the darkness with their load. \u201cStill aching?\u201d T\u00fashin asked Rost\u00f3v in a whisper. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYour honor, you\u2019re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,\u201d said a gunner, coming up to T\u00fashin. \u201cComing, friend.\u201d T\u00fashin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, walked away from the fire. Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared for him, Prince Bagrati\u00f3n sat at dinner, talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherk\u00f3v, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes.", " D\u00f3lokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd of disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed D\u00f3lokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent. On the opposite side stood D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s Cossack, counting the prisoners and marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate. \u201cHow many?\u201d D\u00f3lokhov asked the Cossack. \u201cThe second hundred,\u201d replied the Cossack. \u201cFilez, filez!\u201d * D\u00f3lokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression from the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed with a cruel light. * \u201cGet along, get along!\u201d Den\u00edsov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks who were carrying the body of P\u00e9tya Rost\u00f3v to a hole that had been dug in the garden. CHAPTER XVI After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing, or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the property that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but the process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on essentially as before."], "Out of concern about their own inheritances, Vasili and Catherine attempt to destroy what?": [" With a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the greatest confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the weakness of the French, and the administration of that shock which Napoleon\u2019s army had only awaited to begin its flight. CHAPTER VIII Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon\u2019s hands. The Russian army, only half the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month. Napoleon\u2019s position is most brilliant. He can either fall on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to Smol\u00e9nsk or V\u00edlna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time.", " So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was happening to his troops. Despite news of the capture of the fl\u00e8ches, Napoleon saw that this was not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and they all shunned one another\u2019s eyes\u2014only a de Beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening. But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now\u2014with the fight balanced on such a strained center\u2014destroy him and his army. When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon, or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the Russians still holding their ground\u2014a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind.", " But here was none of all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right place and took mistaken decisions; here was no S\u00f3nya with whom he ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of going there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his father, and nothing to recall that terrible loss to D\u00f3lokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and simple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our P\u00e1vlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most of all, who was a comrade.", " It was plain to him that all these things were no business of his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so. \u201cRussia and summer weather are not bound together,\u201d he thought, repeating words of Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s which he found strangely consoling. His intention of killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that their prisoner\u2019s name was Count Bez\u00fakhov? He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew\u2019s thoughts somewhat differently."], "When Andrew visits Bald Hills, he admits his unhappiness about what or whom?": [" Rost\u00f3v was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ily\u00edn; he let Lavr\u00fashka have another horse and took him along with him. CHAPTER VIII Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew supposed. After the return of Alp\u00e1tych from Smol\u00e9nsk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief\u2019s discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia\u2019s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills. But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguch\u00e1rovo and thence to Moscow.", " But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel\u2019s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: \u201cAh, why have you done this to me?\u201d Soon after Prince Andrew\u2019s return the old prince made over to him a large estate, Boguch\u00e1rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father\u2019s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Boguch\u00e1rovo, began building and spent most of his time there. After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service.", " Kut\u00fazov, who was already weary of Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly. Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way, being only two miles off the Smol\u00e9nsk highroad. During the last three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat older.", " With mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present, now past, and now future. She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills, muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her. \u201cEven then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,\u201d she thought. \u201cHe had always thought what he said then.\u201d And she recalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke, when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will."], "In Austria, General Kutuzov expresses disappointment regarding which of the following?": [" If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot exist, for then man\u2019s will is subject to that law. In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance. The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view\u2014theological, historical, ethical, or philosophic\u2014we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free. This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only through consciousness does he know himself. Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable.", " \u201cAh!...\u201d said Kut\u00fazov glancing at Bolk\u00f3nski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the conversation in French. \u201cAll I can say, General,\u201d said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kut\u00fazov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice. \u201cAll I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general\u2014of whom Austria has so many\u2014and to lay down all this heavy responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us, General.\u201d And Kut\u00fazov smiled in a way that seemed to say, \u201cYou are quite at liberty not to believe me and I don\u2019t even care whether you do or not, but you have no grounds for telling me so.", " No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before.", " It seemed to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity intensified her misery. Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why it is being punished. The countess began to soothe Nat\u00e1sha, who after first listening to her mother\u2019s words, suddenly interrupted her: \u201cLeave off, Mamma! I don\u2019t think, and don\u2019t want to think about it! He just came and then left off, left off....\u201d Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went on quietly: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I have now become quite calm, quite calm.\u201d The day after this conversation Nat\u00e1sha put on the old dress which she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had abandoned since the ball."], "When he brings news about a Russian victory to the Austrian Ministry of War, Andrew is surprised by which of the following?": [" And that is the whole point.\u201d The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in the same tone. \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, \u201con the contrary, your excellency\u2019s participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles,\u201d he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence. Kut\u00fazov bowed with the same smile. \u201cBut that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov. The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kut\u00fazov\u2019s suggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony.", " Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark of the commander in chief\u2019s special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Br\u00fcnn. Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokht\u00farov to Kut\u00fazov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Br\u00fcnn. To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion. The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day\u2014the day of the battle. Reviewing his impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness.", " He paced up and down a few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking. \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous.", " You see it\u2019s hurrah for the Tsar, for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke\u2019s as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte\u2019s, that will be another story and we\u2019ll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its defense\u2014as much as to say: \u2018Heaven is with us, but heaven help you and your capital!\u2019 The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived. It\u2019s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a victory, what effect would that have on the general course of events?"], "When Nicholas is wounded and sees the approaching enemy, he is surprised by what thought?": [" The lesson of the Tar\u00fatino battle and of the day before it, which Kut\u00fazov remembered with pain, must, he thought, have some effect on others too. \u201cThey must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive. Patience and time are my warriors, my champions,\u201d thought Kut\u00fazov. He knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole strength of Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of Lauriston and Barth\u00e9lemi having been sent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, Kut\u00fazov was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait. \u201cThey want to run to see how they have wounded it.", " \u201cWhat was it about?\u201d asked Nicholas. \u201cAlways the same thing,\u201d said Pierre, looking round at his listeners. \u201cEverybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they can.\u201d \u201cWhat can decent men do?\u201d Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. \u201cWhat can be done?\u201d \u201cWhy, this...\u201d \u201cCome into my study,\u201d said Nicholas. Nat\u00e1sha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window. \u201cWell, what would you do?\u201d asked Den\u00edsov. \u201cAlways some fantastic schemes,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cWhy this,\u201d began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room, sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: \u201cthe position in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything.", " When they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do. The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be arrested.", " At posting stations, at inns, and in the landowner\u2019s snuggery, maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and here too at the governor\u2019s party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas) an inexhaustible number of pretty young women, married and unmarried, impatiently awaiting his notice. The women and girls flirted with him and, from the first day, the people concerned themselves to get this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these was the governor\u2019s wife herself, who welcomed Rost\u00f3v as a near relative and called him \u201cNicholas.\u201d Catherine Petr\u00f3vna did actually play valses and the \u00e9cossaise, and dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces."], "Once he becomes Count Bezukhov, Pierre discovers what?": [" \u201cYou behaved as becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won\u2019t go into that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes of society, and even of the court,\u201d he added, lowering his voice. \u201cShe is living in Moscow and you are here. Remember, dear boy,\u201d and he drew Pierre\u2019s arm downwards, \u201cit is simply a misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her a letter at once, and she\u2019ll come here and all will be explained, or else, my dear boy, let me tell you it\u2019s quite likely you\u2019ll have to suffer for it.\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli gave Pierre a significant look. \u201cI know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a keen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\u201d Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vas\u00edli did not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law.", " Nat\u00e1sha was happier than she had ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of evil, unhappiness, or sorrow. At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one. On her way to supper Nat\u00e1sha passed him. Pierre\u2019s gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him. She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own happiness. \u201cHow delightful it is, Count!\u201d said she. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Pierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said. \u201cYes, I am very glad,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can people be dissatisfied with anything?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cEspecially such a capital fellow as Bez\u00fakhov!\u201d In Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s eyes all the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid people, loving one another; none of them capable of injuring another\u2014and so they ought all to be happy.", " Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Bor\u00eds was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Bor\u00eds by the hand with a friendly smile. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d asked Bor\u00eds quietly with a pleasant smile. \u201cI have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.\u201d \u201cYes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,\u201d answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was. Bor\u00eds felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face. \u201cCount Rost\u00f3v asks you to come to dinner today,\u201d said he, after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable. \u201cAh, Count Rost\u00f3v!\u201d exclaimed Pierre joyfully. \u201cThen you are his son, Ily\u00e1? Only fancy, I didn\u2019t know you at first. Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?...", " \u201cHow do you do, cousin?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cYou don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d \u201cI recognize you only too well, too well.\u201d \u201cHow is the count? Can I see him?\u201d asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed. \u201cThe count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.\u201d \u201cCan I see the count?\u201d Pierre again asked. \u201cHm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle\u2019s beef tea is ready\u2014it is almost time,\u201d she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance. Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and said: \u201cThen I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see him.\u201d And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole."], "Nicholas feels a desire to die for ___.": [" But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does not and cannot believe this. However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would be unable to live for a single moment.", " \u201cIf we are ordered to die, we must die. If we\u2019re punished, it means that we have deserved it, it\u2019s not for us to judge. If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no God\u2014nothing!\u201d shouted Nicholas, banging the table\u2014very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts. \u201cOur business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That\u2019s all....\u201d said he. \u201cAnd to drink,\u201d said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel. \u201cYes, and to drink,\u201d assented Nicholas. \u201cHullo there! Another bottle!\u201d he shouted. In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.", " He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him. \u201cOh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI should die of happiness!\u201d The Tsar addressed the officers also: \u201cI thank you all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart.\u201d To Rost\u00f3v every word sounded like a voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar! \u201cYou have earned the St. George\u2019s standards and will be worthy of them.\u201d \u201cOh, to die, to die for him,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. The Tsar said something more which Rost\u00f3v did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d Rost\u00f3v too, bending over his saddle, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully. The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.", " \u201cZat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zere\u2019s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge of it?\u201d he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel. \u201cI am quite of your opinion,\u201d replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger. \u201cI am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,\u201d he concluded, conscious\u2014as were others\u2014after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward. \u201cWhat you said just now was splendid!\u201d said his partner Julie. S\u00f3nya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking."], "The Muscovite society assumes that who has died?": [" He was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in. Something not human\u2014death\u2014was breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it back\u2014to lock it was no longer possible\u2014but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and closed again. Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died. But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke. \u201cYes, it was death! I died\u2014and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!\u201d And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision.", " He felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had aroused in himself. On the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetsk\u00f3ys that Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre\u2019s thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary was in Moscow and living in her house\u2014which had not been burned\u2014in Vozdv\u00edzhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her. On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last one at Borodin\u00f3. \u201cIs it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in? Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?\u201d thought Pierre. He recalled Karat\u00e1ev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them.", " No independent men, such as you or I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the mot d\u2019ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well!\u201d Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more. \u201cBut action with what aim?\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd what position will you adopt toward the government?\u201d \u201cWhy, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but it is a society of true conservatives\u2014a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some Pugach\u00ebv or other from killing my children and yours, and Arakch\u00e9ev from sending me off to some Military Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety.\u201d \u201cYes, but it\u2019s a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm.\u201d \u201cWhy?", " \u201cFancy the Emperor\u2019s position!\u201d said they, and instead of extolling Kut\u00fazov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause of the Emperor\u2019s anxiety. That day Prince Vas\u00edli no longer boasted of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Kut\u00fazov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was added. Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bez\u00fakhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone said that Countess Bez\u00fakhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect; but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her."], "Who does Pierre duel?": [" She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. She waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies, he tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down but looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to go. \u201cWell, what\u2019s this now? What have you been up to now, I should like to know?\u201d she asked sternly. \u201cI? What have I...?\u201d stammered Pierre. \u201cSo it seems you\u2019re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about? What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.\u201d Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but could not reply. \u201cIf you won\u2019t answer, I\u2019ll tell you...\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne went on. \u201cYou believe everything you\u2019re told.", " Go, please go!\u201d And he jumped up and opened the door for him. \u201cGo!\u201d he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Are you ill?\u201d \u201cGo!\u201d the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vas\u00edli had to go without receiving any explanation. A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons, and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity. CHAPTER VI The duel between Pierre and D\u00f3lokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the Emperor\u2019s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierre\u2019s rupture with his wife, was the talk of society. Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage\u2014when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from him\u2014especially as he did not know how, and did not wish, to court society\u2019s favor.", " \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room. \u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room. Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety. Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him.", " He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite Den\u00edsov\u2019s request that he would take no part in the matter, Rost\u00f3v agreed to be D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with Nesv\u00edtski, Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s second. Pierre went home, but Rost\u00f3v with D\u00f3lokhov and Den\u00edsov stayed on at the club till late, listening to the gypsies and other singers. \u201cWell then, till tomorrow at Sok\u00f3lniki,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, as he took leave of Rost\u00f3v in the club porch. \u201cAnd do you feel quite calm?\u201d Rost\u00f3v asked. D\u00f3lokhov paused. \u201cWell, you see, I\u2019ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostrom\u00e1 used to tell me."], "What happens immediately after Andrew returns home?": [" To whom?... Nonsense!\u201d cried the count, suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do. \u201cI promised to pay tomorrow,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cWell!...\u201d said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa. \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped! It happens to everyone!\u201d said the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father\u2019s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone! The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\u2019s words and began bustlingly searching for something. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he muttered, \u201cit will be difficult, I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\u201d And with a furtive glance at his son\u2019s face, the count went out of the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all expected this.", " \u201cIf a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,\u201d he added as if speaking to himself. Prince Andrew glanced at Kut\u00fazov\u2019s face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye socket. \u201cYes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men\u2019s death,\u201d thought Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cThat is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,\u201d he said. Kut\u00fazov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew. There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair, and about some ladies they both knew.", " \u201cAre we really quite lost, your excellency?\u201d he asked again. Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister: \u201cSmol\u00e9nsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvy\u00e1zh.\u201d Having written this and given the paper to Alp\u00e1tych, he told him how to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the boy\u2019s tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him. \u201cYou are a colonel?\u201d shouted the chief of staff with a German accent, in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. \u201cHouses are set on fire in your presence and you stand by! What does this mean?", " \u201cYou are Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v\u2019s son? My wife was a great friend of your mother\u2019s. We are at home on Thursdays\u2014today is Thursday, so please come and see us quite informally,\u201d said the governor, taking leave of him. Immediately on leaving the governor\u2019s, Nicholas hired post horses and, taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Vor\u00f3nezh and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind, everything went well and easily. The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who owned some splendid horses. In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand rubles\u2014to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts."], "When he travels to St. Petersburg, Pierre renounces what?": [" \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly know myself again.\u201d \u201cYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cWell, and you? What are your plans?\u201d \u201cPlans!\u201d repeated Prince Andrew ironically. \u201cMy plans?\u201d he said, as if astonished at the word. \u201cWell, you see, I\u2019m building. I mean to settle here altogether next year....\u201d Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew\u2019s face, which had grown much older. \u201cNo, I meant to ask...\u201d Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates.\u201d Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre\u2019s story of what he had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him.", " The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time. Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to V\u00e9ra and was accepted. Though in Moscow the Rost\u00f3vs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them. The Rost\u00f3vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country neighbors from Otr\u00e1dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Per\u00f3nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bez\u00fakhov, and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg.", " \u201cWhat, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?\u201d he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. \u201cOh, yes, long ago before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,\u201d he reflected. \u201cWhy? But perhaps I shall go.

And he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court.

And there too he killed a great many. In Russia there was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleon\u2019s allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand.", " To the alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balash\u00ebv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balash\u00ebv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses. Balash\u00ebv stood with downcast eyes, looking at the movements of Napoleon\u2019s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes. \u201cBut what do I care about your allies?\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cI have allies\u2014the Poles.", " But this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed. CHAPTER XXVIII Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodin\u00f3 because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of one man\u2014Peter the Great\u2014and that France from a republic became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one man\u2014Napoleon\u2014to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing. If it had depended on Napoleon\u2019s will to fight or not to fight the battle of Borodin\u00f3, and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been the savior of Russia.", " The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now not for Napoleon but always against him.

Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance occurs.

Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to V\u00e9ra and was accepted. Though in Moscow the Rost\u00f3vs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them. The Rost\u00f3vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers.

Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Sper\u00e1nski rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cI had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,\u201d he said with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. \u201cI have known of you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much gossip and tittle-tattle.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cmy father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege.", " She told of an accident they had had on the Sp\u00e1sski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Od\u00fdntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law\u2019s words. In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother: \u201cSo you are really going to the war, Andrew?\u201d she said sighing.

For a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Nat\u00e1sha before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations about S\u00f3nya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again put it off.

Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows.

Those who had quitted Moscow already in July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one\u2019s children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results. \u201cIt is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running away from Moscow,\u201d they were told.

Rostopch\u00edn was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do.", " The first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her, she lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: \u201cThat\u2019s just like a man\u2014selfish and cruel!

And my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?\u201d he asked seriously. \u201cYes, they have. Julie Drubetsk\u00e1ya told me so. I went to see them, but missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.\u201d CHAPTER XXV The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with surprise at Pierre\u2019s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander. \u201cSo you understand the whole position of our troops?\u201d Prince Andrew interrupted him. \u201cYes\u2014that is, how do you mean?\u201d said Pierre."], "In Moscow, Natasha experiences mutual dislike with whom?": [" In the evening, when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to tell him of the young Count K\u00e1mensky\u2019s campaign, the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said, was the only person really attached to him. The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it. \u201cWhy does Prince Andrew, who sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself?", " But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, distinguished by his Sch\u00f6n Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own. What also conduced to Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s being selected as Moscow\u2019s hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suv\u00f3rov. Moreover, paying such honor to Bagrati\u00f3n was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of Kut\u00fazov. \u201cHad there been no Bagrati\u00f3n, it would have been necessary to invent him,\u201d said the wit Shinsh\u00edn, parodying the words of Voltaire. Kut\u00fazov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers, calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.", " Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you may be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of a state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow! With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the troops in turn should enter Moscow \u00e0 la maraude * to obtain provisions for themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for. * As looters. With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back and services to be again performed in the churches. With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was placarded everywhere: PROCLAMATION You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!", " After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine, Nicholas\u2014having exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was already on the friendliest terms\u2014galloped back over abominable roads, in the brightest frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governor\u2019s party. When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself, Nicholas arrived at the governor\u2019s rather late, but with the phrase \u201cbetter late than never\u201d on his lips. It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew that Catherine Petr\u00f3vna would play valses and the \u00e9cossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as to a ball. Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an \u201cin for a penny, in for a pound\u2014who cares?\u201d spirit, and the inevitable small talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances, now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon."], "Mary tells Pierre that she has what motive for marrying?": [" \u201cWhat makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?\u201d \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d said Princess Mary with a smile. \u201cWrite to her parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will.\u201d \u201cNo, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can\u2019t be.... How happy I am! No, it can\u2019t be!\u201d Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary\u2019s hands. \u201cGo to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,\u201d she said. \u201cTo Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I\u2019ll go. But I may come again tomorrow?\u201d Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Nat\u00e1sha was less animated than she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. \u201cIs it possible? No, it can\u2019t be,\u201d he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that filled his soul with joy.", " To remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his adventure at Boguch\u00e1rovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune, had against his will more than once entered his head. For himself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his father\u2019s affairs in order, and would even\u2014he felt it\u2014ensure Princess Mary\u2019s happiness. But S\u00f3nya? And his plighted word? That was why Rost\u00f3v grew angry when he was rallied about Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya. CHAPTER XV On receiving command of the armies Kut\u00fazov remembered Prince Andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters. Prince Andrew arrived at Ts\u00e1revo-Zaym\u00edshche on the very day and at the very hour that Kut\u00fazov was reviewing the troops for the first time.", " \u201cI shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till my legs fail, and I\u2019ll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at last reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow nor sighing...\u201d thought Princess Mary. But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko (Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God. BOOK SEVEN: 1810 - 11 CHAPTER I The Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor\u2014idleness\u2014was a condition of the first man\u2019s blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man has retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle.", " Tell me, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!\u201d he added after a pause, and touched her hand as she did not reply. \u201cI am thinking of what you have told me,\u201d answered Princess Mary. \u201cThis is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at present...\u201d Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in Nat\u00e1sha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for. \u201cTo speak to her now wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said the princess all the same. \u201cBut what am I to do?\u201d \u201cLeave it to me,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI know...\u201d Pierre was looking into Princess Mary\u2019s eyes. \u201cWell?... Well?...\u201d he said. \u201cI know that she loves... will love you,\u201d Princess Mary corrected herself. Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized Princess Mary\u2019s hand."], "After Helene\u2019s party, Natasha is confused about her love for both Andrew and ___.": [" And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force. \u201cYes\u2014love,\u201d he thought again quite clearly. \u201cBut not love which loves for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason, but the love which I\u2014while dying\u2014first experienced when I saw my enemy and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel that bliss. To love one\u2019s neighbors, to love one\u2019s enemies, to love everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?... \u201cWhen loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can destroy it.", " The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from V\u00edlna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagrati\u00f3n, Erm\u00f3lov (who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a famous joke of Erm\u00f3lov\u2019s was being circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering Suv\u00f3rov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia, and not let the army get discouraged. To the third party\u2014in which the Emperor had most confidence\u2014belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two.", " \u201cBut you have not slept,\u201d she said, repressing her joy. \u201cTry to sleep... please!\u201d He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished. Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration. As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his mind\u2014about life and death, and chiefly about death. He felt himself nearer to it. \u201cLove? What is love?\u201d he thought. \u201cLove hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and eternal source.\u201d These thoughts seemed to him comforting.", " Nat\u00e1sha on one side was talking with S\u00f3nya and Bor\u00eds, and V\u00e9ra with a subtle smile was saying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. V\u00e9ra, having noticed Prince Andrew\u2019s attentions to Nat\u00e1sha, decided that at a party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact. When Pierre went up to them he noticed that V\u00e9ra was being carried away by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d V\u00e9ra was saying with an arch smile. \u201cYou are so discerning, Prince, and understand people\u2019s characters so well at a glance."], "Which of the following helps Natasha heal after her illness?": [" The mother\u2019s wounded spirit could not heal. P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had torn from her half her life. When the news of P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Nat\u00e1sha to life. A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life\u2014love\u2014was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life. Prince Andrew\u2019s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another.", " All this at the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another, to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Or\u00ebl he immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him two of his servants, Ter\u00e9nty and V\u00e1ska, who had come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been living on his estate at El\u00e9ts and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him. It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper.", " After the affair at Ostr\u00f3vna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen. CHAPTER XVI On receiving news of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s illness, the countess, though not quite well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with P\u00e9tya and the rest of the household, and the whole family moved from M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s house to their own and settled down in town. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness, her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease Nat\u00e1sha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to medicine\u2014not a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs.", " Another time when she called Duny\u00e1sha her voice trembled, so she called again\u2014though she could hear Duny\u00e1sha coming\u2014called her in the deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened attentively to herself. She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal from within. At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count insisted on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s going with her to consult the doctors. CHAPTER IV After the encounter at Vy\u00e1zma, where Kut\u00fazov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians who pursued them, continued as far as Kr\u00e1snoe without a battle."], "As the section opens, the narrator continues to express disagreement with which of the following?": [" The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts. Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches, and merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the campfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter. Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.", " \u201cBut nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out.\u201d A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army Regulations and\u2014what he had not at all expected\u2014was chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up and, with the aid of the Code Napol\u00e9on and the Institutes of Justinian, he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights. CHAPTER VII Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms, in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular.", " The theaters set up in the Kr\u00e9mlin and in Posny\u00e1kov\u2019s house were closed again at once because the actors and actresses were robbed. Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold. But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was Napoleon\u2019s attempt to stop the looting and re-establish discipline. This is what the army authorities were reporting: \u201cLooting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen goods.\u201d \u201cThe neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly witnessed.\u201d \u201cNothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging\u2014October 9.\u201d \u201cRobbery and pillaging continue.", " Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army. Every army is composed of lower grades of the service\u2014the rank and file\u2014of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next higher military rank\u2014corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer, and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person. A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file; the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which will represent the commander in chief. The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking, burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions from men above him; he himself never gives an order."], "Mary and her father disagree about what?": [" \u201cYou always have such strange fancies! I didn\u2019t even think of being angry,\u201d he replied. But the word always seemed to her to imply: \u201cYes, I am angry but I won\u2019t tell you why.\u201d Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even S\u00f3nya and the old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree, could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they had been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary\u2019s pregnancies, and this was such a time. \u201cWell, messieurs et mesdames,\u201d said Nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to vex her), \u201cI have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I shall have to suffer, so today I\u2019ll go and rest.\u201d And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa.", " He looked at her attentively. \u201cIs it about Nicholas?\u201d he asked. Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping. \u201cMary, you know the Gosp...\u201d but he broke off. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u201cNothing. You mustn\u2019t cry here,\u201d he said, looking at her with the same cold expression. When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view. \u201cYes, to them it must seem sad!\u201d he thought. \u201cBut how simple it is. \u201cThe fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father feedeth them,\u201d he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary; \u201cbut no, they will take it their own way, they won\u2019t understand! They can\u2019t understand that all those feelings they prize so\u2014all our feelings, all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot understand one another,\u201d and he remained silent.", " She saw him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. \u201cDid he believe? Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms of eternal peace and blessedness?\u201d she thought. \u201cFather, tell me how it happened,\u201d she asked through her tears. \u201cGo! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and Russia\u2019s glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell Lise. I will follow.\u201d When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something joyful and mysterious taking place within her. \u201cMary,\u201d she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back, \u201cgive me your hand.\u201d She took her sister-in-law\u2019s hand and held it below her waist.", " Princess Mary saw Dessalles\u2019 embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his son\u2019s letter on the drawing room table; but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think about it. In the evening Michael Iv\u00e1novich, sent by the prince, came to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew\u2019s letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so, ventured to ask him what her father was doing. \u201cAlways busy,\u201d replied Michael Iv\u00e1novich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. \u201cHe\u2019s worrying very much about the new building. He has been reading a little, but now\u201d\u2014Michael Iv\u00e1novich went on, lowering his voice\u2014\u201cnow he\u2019s at his desk, busy with his will, I expect.\u201d (One of the prince\u2019s favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his \u201cwill.\u201d) \u201cAnd Alp\u00e1tych is being sent to Smol\u00e9nsk?\u201d asked Princess Mary."], "In describing Napoleon\u2019s advance toward Moscow, the narrator expresses disagreement with what aspect of historical reports?": [" He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smol\u00e9nsk, still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smol\u00e9nsk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls. So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country. Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at Smol\u00e9nsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him. The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan, for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one way of saving Russia.", " Still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery. Not merely in these cases but continually did that old man\u2014who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move people\u2014use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head. But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood. Beginning with the battle of Borodin\u00f3, from which time his disagreement with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death.", " They blamed Kut\u00fazov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought of nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen Factories because he was comfortable there, that at Kr\u00e1snoe he checked the advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite lost his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on. Not only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand, while Kut\u00fazov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak old courtier, and by Russians as something indefinite\u2014a sort of puppet useful only because he had a Russian name. CHAPTER V In 1812 and 1813 Kut\u00fazov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor was dissatisfied with him.", " And a consciousness of this, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one\u2019s children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results. \u201cIt is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running away from Moscow,\u201d they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopch\u00edn impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing it had to be done. Why did they go?"], "Who rescues Mary from the rioting peasants who will not allow her to leave Bogucharovo?": [" In spite of Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s broadsheets, or because of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave. Some said there had been another battle after Borodin\u00f3 at which the French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the Russian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of Fil\u00ed, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained behind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings.", " \u201cAh!... Alp\u00e1tych... Ah, Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych... Grand! Forgive us for Christ\u2019s sake, eh?\u201d said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him. Rost\u00f3v looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled. \u201cOr perhaps they amuse your honor?\u201d remarked Alp\u00e1tych with a staid air, as he pointed at the old men with his free hand. \u201cNo, there\u2019s not much to be amused at here,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, and rode on a little way. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked. \u201cI make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don\u2019t wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her excellency cannot get away.\u201d \u201cImpossible!\u201d exclaimed Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI have the honor to report to you the actual truth,\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych. Rost\u00f3v dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alp\u00e1tych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared that the princess\u2019 offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alp\u00e1tych sent for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the horses.", " He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions. He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined to do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind. Often, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would say: \u201cWhat can one do with our Russian peasants?\u201d and imagined that he could not bear them. Yet he loved \u201cour Russian peasants\u201d and their way of life with his whole soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results.

This meeting immediately struck Rost\u00f3v as a romantic event. \u201cA helpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression!\u201d thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story. When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her father\u2019s funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten."], "After seeing an amputation being performed on Anatole, the injured Andrew decides that ___ is the greatest human emotion.": [" \u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French. Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre.

Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety.

Pierre felt it strange to see this calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home. Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\u00f3lokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see Nat\u00e1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\u2019s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The countess\u2019 drawing room was full of guests.

But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it\u2014good, agreeable, and even essential\u2014would not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back in memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my judgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action. In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity.", " Nat\u00e1sha looked round at her, and then, red and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved toward the door. \u201cOne word, just one, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d cried Anatole. She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer. \u201cNatalie, just a word, only one!\u201d he kept repeating, evidently not knowing what to say and he repeated it till H\u00e9l\u00e8ne came up to them.

After the French victory at Borodin\u00f3 there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China, we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the historians\u2019 usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards); if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event occurred before our fathers\u2019 eyes, and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of all known wars. The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodin\u00f3 to the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.", " After the loss of the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be. Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak, unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the Russian commanders\u2014not having fully realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left\u2014maintained their extended position from the village of N\u00f3voe to Ut\u00edtsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left flank with but half as many men. (Poniatowski\u2019s action against Ut\u00edtsa, and Uv\u00e1rov\u2019s on the right flank against the French, were actions distinct from the main course of the battle.)", " Why was the battle of Borodin\u00f3 fought? There was not the least sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer to the destruction of Moscow\u2014which we feared more than anything in the world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army\u2014which they feared more than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kut\u00fazov accepted that battle. If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army, he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally clear to Kut\u00fazov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow.", " But neither the French nor the Russians made that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out. The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army. The French, with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon\u2019s invincibility, with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort."], "What causes Helene to make a large donation to the Catholic Church?": [" Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows. The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription.", " The Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French, also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards.

Country neighbors from Otr\u00e1dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Per\u00f3nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bez\u00fakhov, and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg.", " All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that Rost\u00f3v, without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied. He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something over in his mind. Rost\u00f3v was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to his amazement had gained him the St. George\u2019s Cross and even given him a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all understand. \u201cSo others are even more afraid than I am!\u201d he thought. \u201cSo that\u2019s all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my country\u2019s sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes? And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. George\u2019s Cross.... I can\u2019t make it out at all.\u201d But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the service, as often happens, turned in his favor.", " To whom?... Nonsense!\u201d cried the count, suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do. \u201cI promised to pay tomorrow,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cWell!...\u201d said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa. \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped! It happens to everyone!\u201d said the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father\u2019s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone! The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\u2019s words and began bustlingly searching for something. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he muttered, \u201cit will be difficult, I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\u201d And with a furtive glance at his son\u2019s face, the count went out of the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all expected this.", " \u201cWhat are you disputing about?\u201d said the major angrily. \u201cWhat does it matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it\u2019s burned down, and there\u2019s an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn\u2019t the road wide enough?\u201d said he, turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all. \u201cOh, oh, oh! What have they done?\u201d the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. \u201cAll beyond the river, and Z\u00fabova, and in the Kr\u00e9mlin.... Just look! There\u2019s not half of it left. Yes, I told you\u2014the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it is.\u201d \u201cWell, you know it\u2019s burned, so what\u2019s the use of talking?\u201d said the major. As they passed near a church in the Kham\u00f3vniki (one of the few unburned quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard. \u201cAh, the villains! What heathens!"], "What charges do the French levy against Pierre?": [" P\u00e9tya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention. \u201cWell, what about my plan? Peter Kir\u00edlych, for heaven\u2019s sake! You are my only hope,\u201d said P\u00e9tya. \u201cOh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I\u2019ll mention it, I\u2019ll bring it all up today.\u201d \u201cWell, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?\u201d asked the old count. \u201cThe countess has been to Mass at the Razum\u00f3vskis\u2019 and heard the new prayer. She says it\u2019s very fine.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cThe Emperor is to be here tomorrow... there\u2019s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate you!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?\u201d \u201cWe are again retreating. They say we\u2019re already near Smol\u00e9nsk,\u201d replied Pierre. \u201cO Lord, O Lord!\u201d exclaimed the count. \u201cWhere is the manifesto?\u201d \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s appeal? Oh yes!\u201d Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find them.", " But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match, though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood and powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued. Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the French would be destroyed.", " The young officer, with his face still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business with strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as though they were on springs. The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to his superior. \u201cI have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are we to continue firing?\u201d he asked. \u201cGrapeshot!\u201d the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking over the wall of the trench. Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre\u2019s eyes.", " One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting \u201cHurrah!\u201d were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre. A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back. \u201cAll with grapeshot!\u201d shouted the officer. The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges. \u201cThe scoundrels! What are they doing?\u201d shouted the officer, turning to Pierre. The officer\u2019s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow."], "Who is with Andrew when he dies?": [" How can one see all this and not feel sad? But \u2018the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies first\u2019; that\u2019s what the old folks used to tell us,\u201d he added rapidly. \u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201d asked Pierre. \u201cWho? I?\u201d said Karat\u00e1ev. \u201cI say things happen not as we plan but as God judges,\u201d he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said before, and immediately continued: \u201cWell, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still living?\u201d he asked. And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier\u2019s lips as he put these questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that he had no mother. \u201cA wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there\u2019s none as dear as one\u2019s own mother!\u201d said he. \u201cWell, and have you little ones?\u201d he went on asking.", " Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible\u2014in this life to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Mary\u2019s soul always strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas gazed at her. \u201cO God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?\u201d thought he, and placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers. CHAPTER XVI Nat\u00e1sha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity, understanding and expressing each other\u2019s thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in a quite peculiar way.", " The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom. But just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newton\u2019s law), so too the force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies, up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws). All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason. Man\u2019s free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force.", " She had known him as a child, and now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above all his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, \u201cI like you very much, but please don\u2019t laugh at my people.\u201d After exchanging the first greetings, they sat down. * \u201cDelighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.\u201d \u201cAh, and Iv\u00e1nushka is here too!\u201d said Prince Andrew, glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim. \u201cAndrew!\u201d said Princess Mary, imploringly. \u201cIl faut que vous sachiez que c\u2019est une femme,\u201d * said Prince Andrew to Pierre. \u201cAndrew, au nom de Dieu!\u201d *(2) Princess Mary repeated. * \u201cYou must know that this is a woman.\u201d * (2) \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d It was evident that Prince Andrew\u2019s ironical tone toward the pilgrims and Princess Mary\u2019s helpless attempts to protect them were their customary long-established relations on the matter."], "Where does Pierre feel happiness?": [" He did not now make any plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended with that. A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable, possessed him. The whole meaning of life\u2014not for him alone but for the whole world\u2014seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only\u2014his future happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention.", " The longer she lived, the more experience and observation she had of life, the greater was her wonder at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming one another, to obtain that impossible, visionary, sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had loved his wife, she died, but that was not enough: he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman. Her father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew. And they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an instant. Not only do we know this ourselves, but Christ, the Son of God, came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is a probation; yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it. \u201cHow is it that no one realizes this?\u201d thought Princess Mary.", " At last the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans for the future, Pierre\u2019s journeys and occupations, the war, and so on. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend\u2019s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew\u2019s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He checked himself, fearing to seem na\u00efve, yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.", " Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness. Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her sister-in-law\u2019s dress. \u201cThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know, Mary, I am going to love him very much,\u201d said Lise, looking with bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law. Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping. \u201cWhat is the matter, Mary?\u201d \u201cNothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,\u201d she said, wiping away her tears on her sister-in-law\u2019s knee. Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without saying a word."], "The relationship between Natasha and Andrew is mirrored by the relationship between Nicholas and whom?": [" On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events, history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that is to say, their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs. Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard \u201cpower\u201d as the cause of events. Power, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someone\u2019s will and the execution of that will by others. To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the Deity. If the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event.", " \u201cWhy talk of me?\u201d she said quietly and glanced at Nat\u00e1sha. Nat\u00e1sha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again silent. \u201cAndrew, would you like...\u201d Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling voice, \u201cwould you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking about you!\u201d Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him. \u201cYes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?\u201d When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew\u2019s room he looked at his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him. When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry.", " When Rost\u00f3v approached her she was standing settling up for the game. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued to upbraid the general who had won from her. \u201cVery pleased, mon cher,\u201d she then said, holding out her hand to Nicholas. \u201cPray come and see me.\u201d After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom Malv\u00edntseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas knew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her. Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear, which he himself did not understand. When he had parted from Malv\u00edntseva Nicholas wished to return to the dancing, but the governor\u2019s little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to her sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way.", " \u201cI loved you, but I have orders from Arakch\u00e9ev and will kill the first of you who moves forward.\u201d Little Nicholas turned to look at Pierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his father\u2014Prince Andrew\u2014and his father had neither shape nor form, but he existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love: he felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father caressed and pitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror seized young Nicholas and he awoke. \u201cMy father!\u201d he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) \u201cMy father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know they want me to learn. And I will learn."], "When Dolokhov and Denisov encounter retreating French troops, what do they do?": [" NAPOLEON MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812 Kut\u00fazov replied: \u201cI should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit of my nation.\u201d But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking. During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tar\u00fatino, a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies\u2014both in spirit and in number\u2014as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston\u2019s mission; the abundance of provisions at Tar\u00fatino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at Tar\u00fatino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every soldier\u2019s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side.", " Kut\u00fazov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers\u2014ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved\u2014who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number, and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the frontier. This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on the French army. So it was at Kr\u00e1snoe, where they expected to find one of the three French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men. Despite all Kut\u00fazov\u2019s efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Kr\u00e1snoe for three days.", " After going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of T\u00fachkov\u2019s corps were stationed to defend the left flank. Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military importance. In front of T\u00fachkov\u2019s troops was some high ground not occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed the same opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank increased Pierre\u2019s doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters. Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and shared their opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder.", " \u201cYour excellency! Let us attack them! I\u2019ll dwive them off.\u201d \u201cAttack indeed!\u201d said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly. \u201cAnd why are you stopping here? Don\u2019t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron back.\u201d The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side of the river. The two P\u00e1vlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogd\u00e1nich Schubert, came up to Den\u00edsov\u2019s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rost\u00f3v, without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning Tely\u00e1nin. Rost\u00f3v, feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel\u2019s athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red neck."], "What causes Natasha\u2019s father to insist that she go to Moscow?": [" Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows. The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription.", " The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred. Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war.", " And again in imagination she went over her whole conversation with Kur\u00e1gin, and again saw the face, gestures, and tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm. CHAPTER XI Anatole Kur\u00e1gin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his creditors demanded from his father. His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief\u2014a post his father had procured for him\u2014and would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to him Princess Mary and Julie Kar\u00e1gina. Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre\u2019s house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave him money under the guise of loans.", " Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as its problem. The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self-destruction toward which\u2014ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena\u2014the old method of history is moving. All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all unknown, infinitely small, elements."], "Over what do the tsar and Kutuzov disagree?": [" He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him. \u201cOh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI should die of happiness!\u201d The Tsar addressed the officers also: \u201cI thank you all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart.\u201d To Rost\u00f3v every word sounded like a voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar! \u201cYou have earned the St. George\u2019s standards and will be worthy of them.\u201d \u201cOh, to die, to die for him,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. The Tsar said something more which Rost\u00f3v did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d Rost\u00f3v too, bending over his saddle, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully. The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.", " Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated. The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Rost\u00f3v was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every movement of the Tsar\u2019s seemed to him enchanting. Stopping in front of the P\u00e1vlograds, the Tsar said something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled. Seeing that smile, Rost\u00f3v involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign.", " \u201cYou always have such strange fancies! I didn\u2019t even think of being angry,\u201d he replied. But the word always seemed to her to imply: \u201cYes, I am angry but I won\u2019t tell you why.\u201d Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even S\u00f3nya and the old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree, could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they had been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary\u2019s pregnancies, and this was such a time. \u201cWell, messieurs et mesdames,\u201d said Nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to vex her), \u201cI have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I shall have to suffer, so today I\u2019ll go and rest.\u201d And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa.", " Well, and what do you think, dear friends?\u201d Karat\u00e1ev continued, his face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story: \u201cWhat do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the authorities. \u2018I have taken six lives,\u2019 he says (he was a great sinner), \u2018but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don\u2019t let him suffer because of me.\u2019 So he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the papers all in due form\u2014the authorities I mean\u2014time passed. The affair reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar\u2019s decree came: to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the old man. \u2018Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain?"], "After the war, people notice that Pierre has changed in which of the following ways?": [" He paced up and down a few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking. \u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous.", " \u201cNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....\u201d \u201cYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cYou had better go.\u201d The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room. Pierre looked over his spectacles with na\u00efve surprise, now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind. \u201cWhy should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?\u201d exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. \u201cI have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?\u201d \u201cLise!\u201d was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly: \u201cYou treat me like an invalid or a child.", " He did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded, though many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face. \u201cWhy\u2019s that fellow in front of the line?\u201d shouted somebody at him again. \u201cTo the left!... Keep to the right!\u201d the men shouted to him. Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded. \u201cHow have you got here?\u201d he said, and galloped on. Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of getting in someone\u2019s way again, galloped after the adjutant. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening here? May I come with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cOne moment, one moment!\u201d replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and then addressed Pierre.", " But even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted them, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, however, he had learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and therefore\u2014to see it and enjoy its contemplation\u2014he naturally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over men\u2019s heads, and gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became. That dreadful question, \u201cWhat for?\u201d which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that question, \u201cWhat for?\u201d a simple answer was now always ready in his soul: \u201cBecause there is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls from a man\u2019s head.\u201d CHAPTER XIII In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all."], "How does Pierre react to Moscow\u2019s ruins?": [" If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis XIV and Iv\u00e1n the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians reply that Louis XIV\u2019s activity, contrary to the program, reacted on Louis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV\u2014why should it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such reactions? To these questions there are and can be no answers. Equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican government, and to Napoleon III.", " An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin\u2019s Field. It was a fine day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the Z\u00fabovski rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns. No flames were seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin. On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well. Here and there he could see churches that had not been burned. The Kr\u00e9mlin, which was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of Iv\u00e1n the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.", " \u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you like this?\u201d Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on. \u201cWhat is the matter, Count?\u201d asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone. \u201cWhat? What? Why? Don\u2019t ask me,\u201d said Pierre, and looked round at Nat\u00e1sha whose radiant, happy expression\u2014of which he was conscious without looking at her\u2014filled him with enchantment. \u201cAre you remaining in Moscow, then?\u201d Pierre hesitated. \u201cIn Moscow?\u201d he said in a questioning tone. \u201cYes, in Moscow. Good-by!\u201d \u201cAh, if only I were a man! I\u2019d certainly stay with you. How splendid!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cMamma, if you\u2019ll let me, I\u2019ll stay!\u201d Pierre glanced absently at Nat\u00e1sha and was about to say something, but the countess interrupted him. \u201cYou were at the battle, we heard.\u201d \u201cYes, I was,\u201d Pierre answered. \u201cThere will be another battle tomorrow...\u201d he began, but Nat\u00e1sha interrupted him.", " He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow."], "The narrator asserts that history is made by what?": [" For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves. If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply would have been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period, nor would there have been any contradictions. But modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers. Modern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these events?", " If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not the history of the life of the peoples. CHAPTER V The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found. The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history. The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur\u2014that is, as soon as history begins\u2014that theory explains nothing. The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the people\u2019s will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.", " Popes, kings, and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people did not go, for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown. Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples. The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the French Revolution they guillotined one another.", " But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history, says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law. The presence of the problem of man\u2019s free will, though unexpressed, is felt at every step of history. All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question. If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents. If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man\u2019s in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity."], "Before Nicholas marries Mary, he hides what from his mother and sister?": [" Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness. Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her sister-in-law\u2019s dress. \u201cThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know, Mary, I am going to love him very much,\u201d said Lise, looking with bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law. Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping. \u201cWhat is the matter, Mary?\u201d \u201cNothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,\u201d she said, wiping away her tears on her sister-in-law\u2019s knee. Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without saying a word.", " Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: \u201cPapa! Mamma\u2019s standing here!\u201d Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and his voice said crossly: \u201cI can\u2019t get a moment\u2019s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring him here?\u201d \u201cI only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....\u201d Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery.

My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,\u201d and D\u00f3lokhov pressed Rost\u00f3v\u2019s hand and burst into tears. When he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rost\u00f3v that he was living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it. He implored Rost\u00f3v to go on and prepare her. Rost\u00f3v went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise learned that D\u00f3lokhov the brawler, D\u00f3lokhov the bully, lived in Moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate of sons and brothers. CHAPTER VI Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in Moscow their house was always full of visitors.

And his cold, stern look replied: \u201cBecause you are alive and thinking of the living, while I...\u201d In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and Nat\u00e1sha. He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont. \u201cHow are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?\u201d said he in a voice as calm and aloof as his look. Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror into Princess Mary\u2019s heart as the tone of his voice. \u201cAnd have you brought little Nicholas?\u201d he asked in the same slow, quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember."], "In the years that follow, Natasha dedicates herself to what?": [" The gate was again hidden by smoke. Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall, toward the Zn\u00e1menka. \u201cClear that away!\u201d said the officer, pointing to the beams and the corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw the corpses over the parapet. Who these men were nobody knew. \u201cClear that away!\u201d was all that was said of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink.

This fact impressed Alp\u00e1tych, but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it. All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit. Everything not connected with the execution of the prince\u2019s orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alp\u00e1tych. On reaching Smol\u00e9nsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up in the G\u00e1china suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferap\u00f3ntov, where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years. Some thirty years ago Ferap\u00f3ntov, by Alp\u00e1tych\u2019s advice, had bought a wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an inn, and a corn dealer\u2019s shop in that province.", " \u201cWhat is your conception of Freemasonry?\u201d \u201cI imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who have virtuous aims,\u201d said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. \u201cI imagine...\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this answer. \u201cHave you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?\u201d \u201cNo, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,\u201d said Pierre, so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying. \u201cI have been an atheist,\u201d answered Pierre. \u201cYou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life, therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?\u201d said the Rhetor, after a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d assented Pierre.

The reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal. The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations, turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown more manly, lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony, and acquired the serenity that comes with years."], "Whom does Andrew\u2019s son adore?": [" Now come here.\u201d *Kut\u00fazov.

Nat\u00e1sha guessed they were talking about the old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her. She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a manservant to the Vozdv\u00edzhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow. To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince, and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause.", " He thought not of this pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him, and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee. \u201cWell, go on!\u201d said his son. Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out of the room. As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity, and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible. \u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to go, Andrew?\u201d asked his sister.", " \u201cIt seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t say so!\u201d replied the countess. \u201cHe chose his friends badly,\u201d interposed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cPrince Vas\u00edli\u2019s son, he, and a certain D\u00f3lokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what!

He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. \u201cAnd why did she resist her seducer when she loved him?\u201d he thought. \u201cGod could not have put into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife\u2014as she once was\u2014did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been found out, nothing discovered,\u201d Pierre again said to himself. \u201cAll we can know is that we know nothing.", " Popes, kings, and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people did not go, for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown. Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples. The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the French Revolution they guillotined one another."], "Whose spiritual odyssey spans the novel?": [" The mother\u2019s wounded spirit could not heal. P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had torn from her half her life. When the news of P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Nat\u00e1sha to life. A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life\u2014love\u2014was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life. Prince Andrew\u2019s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another.", " When he met her again in Vor\u00f3nezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her. But that day\u2019s encounter in church had, he felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rost\u00f3v could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction.", " She knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved, and was happy in regard to it. But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving Vor\u00f3nezh that those who saw her off, as they looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength. As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached Yarosl\u00e1vl the thought of what might await her there\u2014not after many days, but that very evening\u2014again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit.", " Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her diary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for his wife. Perhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the children\u2019s moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady, tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach, in which she had her being. He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself."], "Who becomes a widower when his wife, Lise, dies?": [" At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s wife, sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife. \u201cNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame,\u201d he thought. If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not?", " \u201cAnd it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this! Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.\u201d \u201cWhat else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...\u201d said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew had written in Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s album. \u201cMamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t, Nat\u00e1sha!

How happy I am!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother. At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him of his love for Nat\u00e1sha and his firm resolve to make her his wife. That day Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had a reception at her house. The French ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and gentlemen.", " \u201cYou are off to the war, Prince?\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna. \u201cGeneral Kut\u00fazov,\u201d said Bolk\u00f3nski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general\u2019s name like a Frenchman, \u201chas been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....\u201d \u201cAnd Lise, your wife?\u201d \u201cShe will go to the country.\u201d \u201cAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?\u201d \u201cAndr\u00e9,\u201d said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, \u201cthe vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!\u201d Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre\u2019s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.", " How can one see all this and not feel sad?

And a house? So you have abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still living?\u201d he asked. And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier\u2019s lips as he put these questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that he had no mother. \u201cA wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there\u2019s none as dear as one\u2019s own mother!\u201d said he. \u201cWell, and have you little ones?\u201d he went on asking."], "Who practices forgiveness as a way of enduring her father\u2019s cruel treatment?": [" And my father cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will be decided very shortly. Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrew\u2019s absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late. After his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits. He has again become as I used to know him when a child: kind, affectionate, with that heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me, that life is not over for him. But together with this mental change he has grown physically much weaker.", " There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cNo?

You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Iv\u00e1novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: \u2018We don\u2019t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.\u2019 Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father.

Having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicholas, following her example, would sob, and without permission would leave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and comfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her father\u2019s irritability, which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water, it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this loving despot\u2014the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her\u2014knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame for everything.", " Then there\u2019s this house, which must be built in order to have a nook of one\u2019s own in which to be quiet.

It was awaiting the Emperor\u2019s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.

CHAPTER XXV During that year after his son\u2019s departure, Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s health and temper became much worse.", " Toll, who in this battle played the part of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped assiduously from place to place, finding everything upside down everywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagov\u00fat\u2019s corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight, though the corps should long before have joined Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov. Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it, Toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely, saying that he ought to be shot. General Bagov\u00fat, a fighting old soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay, confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody\u2019s surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to Toll. \u201cI prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as well as anybody,\u201d he said, and advanced with a single division.

Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balash\u00ebv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses. Balash\u00ebv stood with downcast eyes, looking at the movements of Napoleon\u2019s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes. \u201cBut what do I care about your allies?\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cI have allies\u2014the Poles.", " Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily and surely recognized, Lavr\u00fashka was not in the least abashed but merely did his utmost to gain his new master\u2019s favor. He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon\u2019s presence could no more intimidate him than Rost\u00f3v\u2019s, or a sergeant major\u2019s with the rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or Napoleon could deprive him of. So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavr\u00fashka screwed up his eyes and considered. In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cif there\u2019s a battle soon, yours will win. That\u2019s right. But if three days pass, then after that, well, then that same battle will not soon be over.\u201d Lelorgne d\u2019Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus: \u201cIf a battle takes place within the next three days the French will win, but if later, God knows what will happen.\u201d Napoleon did not smile, though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words to be repeated."], "Which character do many critics find to be a reflection of Tolstoy?": [" He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the Sem\u00ebnov regiment.\u201d It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity. What do these reproaches mean? Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I (the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813) flow from the same sources\u2014the circumstances of his birth, education, and life\u2014that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed? In what does the substance of those reproaches lie? It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I, standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception inseparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth\u2014that this character\u2014though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not accuse him of that)\u2014had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is, with books and lectures and with taking notes from them.", " In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and questioned Balash\u00ebv about the Russian capital, not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as if convinced that Balash\u00ebv, as a Russian, must be flattered by his curiosity. \u201cHow many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true that Moscow is called \u2018Holy Moscow\u2019? How many churches are there in Moscow?\u201d he asked. And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches, he remarked: \u201cWhy such a quantity of churches?\u201d \u201cThe Russians are very devout,\u201d replied Balash\u00ebv. \u201cBut a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people,\u201d said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark. Balash\u00ebv respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor. \u201cEvery country has its own character,\u201d said he. \u201cBut nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,\u201d said Napoleon.", " In our times that is worth something, isn\u2019t it?

After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg\u2019s proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere. In the family\u2019s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved V\u00e9ra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands.", " \u201cDon\u2019t mention it, General, as if I\u2019d be so bold!\u201d replied the captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at Ismail. \u201cAnd tell Mr. D\u00f3lokhov that I won\u2019t forget him\u2014he may be quite easy.

When the old man began to speak too loud, Sper\u00e1nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign. Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Sper\u00e1nski rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cI had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,\u201d he said with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. \u201cI have known of you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much gossip and tittle-tattle.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cmy father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege.", " Nat\u00e1sha on one side was talking with S\u00f3nya and Bor\u00eds, and V\u00e9ra with a subtle smile was saying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. V\u00e9ra, having noticed Prince Andrew\u2019s attentions to Nat\u00e1sha, decided that at a party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact. When Pierre went up to them he noticed that V\u00e9ra was being carried away by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d V\u00e9ra was saying with an arch smile. \u201cYou are so discerning, Prince, and understand people\u2019s characters so well at a glance.", " Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question. \u201cFor me? For me?... Trying for me!...\u201d said she. \u201cHe always was rather harsh; and now I should think he\u2019s getting very trying,\u201d said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister. \u201cYou are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride,\u201d said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am.\u201d Her brother shook his head incredulously. \u201cThe only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth, Andrew... is Father\u2019s way of treating religious subjects. I don\u2019t understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day, and can go so far astray."], "Which of the following make Natasha Pierre\u2019s equal?": [" The historian evidently decomposes Alexander\u2019s power into the components: Talleyrand, Chateaubriand, and the rest\u2014but the sum of the components, that is, the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Sta\u00ebl, and the others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand, Madame de Sta\u00ebl, and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted\u2014that is, how component forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A\u2014the historian is again obliged to fall back on power\u2014the force he had denied\u2014and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant.", " No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of contempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre\u2019s presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had said. Pierre\u2019s past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Nat\u00e1sha (of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierre\u2019s friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember\u2014all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.", " The unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently. He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there. CHAPTER XI Prince Andrew\u2019s eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolk\u00f3nski, but not pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign. Chern\u00fdshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor, who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.", " \u201cIs it possible that I\u2014the \u2018chit of a girl,\u2019 as everybody called me,\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha\u2014\u201cis it possible that I am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father looks up to?

Yes, but what did he ask me?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, but she had not understood his question. \u201cForgive me!\u201d he said. \u201cBut you are so young, and I have already been through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know yourself.\u201d Nat\u00e1sha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words. \u201cHard as this year which delays my happiness will be,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, \u201cit will give you time to be sure of yourself.

Then the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together: \u201cSic transit gloria mundi.\u201d Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President\u2019s chair sat a young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck. On his right sat the Italian abb\u00e9 whom Pierre had met at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s two years before. There were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kur\u00e1gins\u2019.

The door opened and someone came in. By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he saw a rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the darkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands. This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from below. \u201cFor what have you come hither?\u201d asked the newcomer, turning in Pierre\u2019s direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. \u201cWhy have you, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?\u201d At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man.", " Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him. The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head. \u201cThe herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader.\u201d This is what historians of the first class say\u2014those who assume the unconditional transference of the people\u2019s will. \u201cIf the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd.\u201d Such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known.", " And that is the whole point.\u201d The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in the same tone. \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, \u201con the contrary, your excellency\u2019s participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles,\u201d he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence. Kut\u00fazov bowed with the same smile. \u201cBut that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov. The general frowned.

CHAPTER V The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees. Den\u00edsov, the esaul, and P\u00e9tya rode silently, following the peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves, silently led them to the edge of the forest. He ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with his hand. Den\u00edsov and P\u00e9tya rode up to him.

S\u00f3nya\u2019s costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome, and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa Iv\u00e1novna consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow, drove up to the porch.", " Someone asks: \u201cWhat moves it?\u201d A peasant says the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away. The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil, or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong. But the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself, for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he has no right to stop in his search for the cause.", " He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile. \u201cI have long been waiting for you,\u201d that frightened happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as she raised her hand to Prince Andrew\u2019s shoulder. They were the second couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and Nat\u00e1sha danced exquisitely. Her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful\u2014compared to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But H\u00e9l\u00e8ne seemed, as it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned her person, while Nat\u00e1sha was like a girl exposed for the first time, who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary."], "Tolstoy presents which of the following as stronger than rational thought?": [" \u201cYes,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, \u201cbut with this little difference, that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me,\u201d he went on, \u201cif things depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow\u2019s battle will depend and not on those others....

The children and their governesses were glad of Pierre\u2019s return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did. He alone could play on the clavichord that \u00e9cossaise (his only piece) to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all. Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent, with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection.", " We were all weary of waiting for you.

She finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents. They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a bright-blue S\u00e8vres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count\u2019s portrait on the lid which Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had long wished for such a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards. \u201cThank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,\u201d said she as she always did.", " She looked at him and did not think, but felt, about something different. She felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband\u2019s plans, thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew. Her husband\u2019s account of the boy\u2019s agitation while Pierre was speaking struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young Nicholas."], "Tolstoy\u2019s characterizations of historical leaders present them as which of the following?": [" Historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the conditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them. But in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have those leaders? The leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people: the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people. But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the people\u2019s will or only some part of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the people\u2019s will, as some historians suppose, then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the people\u2019s life, as other so-called \u201cphilosophical\u201d historians believe, then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation\u2019s life, we have first of all to know in what the nation\u2019s life consists.", " History proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their mistresses and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Diderot, Beaumarchais, and others? Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kaz\u00e1n and Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Iv\u00e1n the Terrible and by his correspondence with K\u00farbski? Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies? For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade\u2014the deliverance of Jerusalem\u2014had been clearly defined by historic leaders.", " (With this method of observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the direction he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the people\u2019s change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side, or even in the rear.) \u201cIf the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd.\u201d So say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of their age. The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase\u2014a restatement of the question in other words.", " But the mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate. Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation. The sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies, who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars, campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties. The historians call this activity of the historical figures \u201cthe reaction.\u201d In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the reaction."], "Tolstoy links death with which of the following experiences?": [" He was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in. Something not human\u2014death\u2014was breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it back\u2014to lock it was no longer possible\u2014but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and closed again. Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died. But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke. \u201cYes, it was death! I died\u2014and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!\u201d And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision.", " It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kut\u00fazov had said, but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in the commander in chief\u2019s soul as in that of every Russian. And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited. CHAPTER XXXVI Prince Andrew\u2019s regiment was among the reserves which till after one o\u2019clock were stationed inactive behind Sem\u00ebnovsk, under heavy artillery fire. Toward two o\u2019clock the regiment, having already lost more than two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between Sem\u00ebnovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o\u2019clock.", " Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break the silence, looked at Nat\u00e1sha and at Princess Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy. \u201cDo you take vodka, Count?\u201d asked Princess Mary, and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past. \u201cNow tell us about yourself,\u201d said she. \u201cOne hears such improbable wonders about you.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him. \u201cThey even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary Abr\u00e1movna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought to have happened, to me. Step\u00e1n Step\u00e1nych also instructed me how I ought to tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people invite me out and tell me all about myself.\u201d Nat\u00e1sha smiled and was on the point of speaking.", " It is very difficult to tell the truth, and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he told them all that. In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: \u201cYou cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,\u201d Prince Andrew, whom Bor\u00eds was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward Bor\u00eds, who had managed to please him the day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent with papers from Kut\u00fazov to the Tsar\u00e9vich, he looked in on Bor\u00eds, hoping to find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he gave Bor\u00eds a pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at Rost\u00f3v, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company."], "Which of the following represents, for Tolstoy, the triumph of Russian spirit over European reason?": [" \u201cThe army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly antique valor of the Russian army, which they\u2014which it\u201d (he corrected himself) \u201chas shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth\u2014there are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa\u201d (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words \u201cRussian army\u201d), \u201cI tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,\u201d he went on rapidly. \u201cGeneral Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a hillside.", " Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units (battles, campaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered. The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed than is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.", " \u201cDen\u00edsov, don\u2019t make fun of it!\u201d cried Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIt is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...\u201d \u201cI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...\u201d \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d And Rost\u00f3v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to die\u2014not in saving the Emperor\u2019s life (he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms. CHAPTER XI The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell.", " NAPOLEON MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812 Kut\u00fazov replied: \u201cI should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit of my nation.\u201d But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking. During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tar\u00fatino, a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies\u2014both in spirit and in number\u2014as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston\u2019s mission; the abundance of provisions at Tar\u00fatino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at Tar\u00fatino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every soldier\u2019s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side."], "Tolstoy uses Pierre\u2019s name, as well as Platon\u2019s role, to comment on Russian attitudes toward ___.": [" Rostopch\u00edn, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding. Ever since the enemy\u2019s entry into Smol\u00e9nsk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of \u201cthe heart of Russia.\u201d Not only did it seem to him (as to all administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscow\u2019s inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority. Rostopch\u00edn was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do.", " Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kut\u00fazov\u2019s calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen\u2019s proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the French right wing. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, \u201cI cannot approve of the count\u2019s plan. Moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military history supports that view. For instance...\u201d Kut\u00fazov seemed to reflect, searching for an example, then with a clear, na\u00efve look at Bennigsen he added: \u201cOh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy....\u201d There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all. The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said.", " \u201cTiens!\u201d said the captain. Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name. Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in the world, and especially therefore above himself. When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he understood that. The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand it he begged Pierre to continue. \u201cPlat\u00f3nic love, clouds...\u201d he muttered. Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together, something loosened Pierre\u2019s tongue.", " Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs. All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the French. But when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man, abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopch\u00edn suddenly appeared senseless."]}
