But the curse is too strong. The special thing which Cassandra tries again and again to say always eludes them, and they can raise no finger to prevent the disaster happening. And when it does happen they are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, \"dreams wandering in the daylight.\" The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further significance which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the incarnation of that knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (Hdt. ix. 16). Agamemnon himself, the King of Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol of pride and the fall of pride. We must not think of him as bad or specially cruel. The watchman loved him (ll. 34 f.), and the lamentations of the Elders over his death have a note of personal affection (pp. 66 ff.). But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that [Greek: Aga mimnei], \"the unseen Wrath abides.\" _Ag\u00e2_, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is more like Nemesis, the feeling that something is [Greek: agan], \"too much,\" the condemnation of _Hubris_ (pride or overgrowth) and of all things that are in excess.", " \"The life of the Year-Daemon, who lies at the root of so many Greek gods and heroes, is normally a story of Pride and Punishment.

RUSKIN HOUSE, 40 MUSEUM STREET, W.C. PREFACE The sense of difficulty, and indeed of awe, with which a scholar approaches the task of translating the _Agamemnon_ depends directly on its greatness as poetry. It is in part a matter of diction. The language of Aeschylus is an extraordinary thing, the syntax stiff and simple, the vocabulary obscure, unexpected, and steeped in splendour. Its peculiarities cannot be disregarded, or the translation will be false in character. Yet not Milton himself could produce in English the same great music, and a translator who should strive ambitiously to represent the complex effect of the original would clog his own powers of expression and strain his instrument to breaking. But, apart from the diction in this narrower sense, there is a quality of atmosphere surrounding the _Agamemnon_ which seems almost to defy reproduction in another setting, because it depends in large measure on the position of the play in the historical development of Greek literature. If we accept the view that all Art to some extent, and Greek tragedy in a very special degree, moves in its course of development from Religion to Entertainment, from a Service to a Performance, the _Agamemnon_ seems to stand at a critical point where the balance of the two elements is near perfection."], "Where is Agamemnon set?": [" AGAMEMNON. Enough! I have spoke my purpose, fixed and plain. CLYTEMNESTRA. Were Priam the conqueror ... Think, would he refrain? AGAMEMNON. Oh, stores of broideries would be trampled then! CLYTEMNESTRA. Lord, care not for the cavillings of men! AGAMEMNON. The murmur of a people hath strange weight. CLYTEMNESTRA. Who feareth envy, feareth to be great. AGAMEMNON. 'Tis graceless when a woman strives to lead. CLYTEMNESTRA. When a great conqueror yields, 'tis grace indeed, AGAMEMNON. So in this war thou must my conqueror be? CLYTEMNESTRA. Yield! With good will to yield is victory! AGAMEMNON. Well, if I needs must ... Be it as thou hast said! Quick! Loose me these bound slaves on which I tread, And while I walk yon wonders of the sea God grant no eye of wrath be cast on me From far! [_The Attendants untie his shoes_. For even now it likes me not To waste mine house, thus marring underfoot The pride thereof, and wondrous broideries Bought in far seas with silver. But of these Enough.--And mark, I charge thee, this princess Of Ilion; tend her with all gentleness. God's eye doth see, and loveth from afar, The merciful conqueror. For no slave of war Is slave by his own will. She is the prize And chosen flower of Ilion's treasuries, Set by the soldiers' gift to follow me. Now therefore, seeing I am constrained by thee And do thy will, I walk in conqueror's guise Beneath my Gate, trampling sea-crimson dyes.", " CHORUS. (_Some Elders_.)

CLYTEMNESTRA. Ah, call upon Him!

The _Agamemnon_ is not, like Aeschylus' _Suppliant Women_, a statue half-hewn out of the rock. It is a real play, showing clash of character and situation, suspense and movement, psychological depth and subtlety. Yet it still remains something more than a play. Its atmosphere is not quite of this world. In the long lyrics especially one feels that the guiding emotion is not the entertainer's wish to thrill an audience, not even perhaps the pure artist's wish to create beauty, but something deeper and more prophetic, a passionate contemplation and expression of truth; though of course the truth in question is something felt rather than stated, something that pervades life, an eternal and majestic rhythm like the movement of the stars. Thus, if Longinus is right in defining Sublimity as \"the ring, or resonance, of greatness of soul,\" one sees in part where the sublimity of the _Agamemnon_ comes from. And it is worth noting that the faults which some critics have found in the play are in harmony with this conclusion. For the sublimity that is rooted in religion tolerates some faults and utterly refuses to tolerate others. The _Agamemnon_ may be slow in getting to work; it may be stiff with antique conventions. It never approaches to being cheap or insincere or shallow or sentimental or showy. It never ceases to be genuinely a \"criticism of life.\""], "At the end of the play, which of the following characters is NOT dead?": [" A HERALD. CHORUS of Argive Elders, faithful to AGAMEMNON.

At the first outset of his expedition against Troy there had appeared an omen, the bloody sign of two eagles devouring a mother-hare with her unborn young.... The question was thus put to the Kings and their prophet: Did they or did they not accept the sign, and wish to be those Eagles? And they had answered Yes. They would have their vengeance, their full and extreme victory, and were ready to pay the price. The sign once accepted, the prophet recoils from the consequences which, in prophetic vision, he sees following therefrom: but the decision has been taken, and the long tale of cruelty rolls on, culminating in the triumphant sack of Troy, which itself becomes not an assertion of Justice but a whirlwind of godless destruction. And through all these doings of fierce beasts and angry men the unseen Pity has been alive and watching, the Artemis who \"abhors the Eagles' feast,\" the \"Apollo or Pan or Zeus\" who hears the crying of the robbed vulture; nay, if even the Gods were deaf, the mere \"wrong of the dead\" at Troy might waken, groping for some retribution upon the \"Slayer of Many Men\" (pp. 15, 20). If we ask why men are so blind, seeking their welfare thus through incessant evil, Aeschylus will tell us that the cause lies in the infection of old sin, old cruelty.", " The Elders who talk with her wish to believe, they try to understand, they are really convinced of Cassandra's powers. But the curse is too strong. The special thing which Cassandra tries again and again to say always eludes them, and they can raise no finger to prevent the disaster happening. And when it does happen they are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, \"dreams wandering in the daylight.\" The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further significance which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the incarnation of that knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (Hdt. ix. 16). Agamemnon himself, the King of Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol of pride and the fall of pride. We must not think of him as bad or specially cruel. The watchman loved him (ll. 34 f.), and the lamentations of the Elders over his death have a note of personal affection (pp. 66 ff.). But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that [Greek: Aga mimnei], \"the unseen Wrath abides.\" _Ag\u00e2_, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is more like Nemesis, the feeling that something is [Greek: agan], \"too much,\" the condemnation of _Hubris_ (pride or overgrowth) and of all things that are in excess."], "Who is revealed to have sacrificed his daughter to obtain a favorable wind for his fleet?": [" Then \"Artemis\" he whispered, he named the name; And the brother Kings they shook in the hearts of them, And smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came. But the King, the elder, hath found voice and spoken: \"A heavy doom, sure, if God's will were broken; But to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth, Is that not heavy? That her blood should flow On her father's hand, hard beside an altar? My path is sorrow wheresoe'er I go. Shall Agamemnon fail his ships and people, And the hosts of Hellas melt as melts the snow? They cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell, For a Virgin's blood: 'tis a rite of old, men tell. And they burn with longing.--O God may the end be well!\" (_But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice._) To the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly, And a strange wind within his bosom tossed, A wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy; And he rose up, daring to the uttermost. For men are boldened by a Blindness, straying Toward base desire, which brings grief hereafter, Yea, and itself is grief; So this man hardened to his own child's slaying, As help to avenge him for a woman's laughter And bring his ships relief! Her \"Father, Father,\" her sad cry that lingered, Her virgin heart's breath they held all as naught, Those bronze-clad witnesses and battle-hungered; And there they prayed, and when the prayer was wrought He charged the young men to uplift and bind her, As ye lift a wild kid, high above the altar, Fierce-huddling forward, fallen, clinging sore To the robe that wrapt her; yea, he bids them hinder The sweet mouth's utterance, the cries that falter, --His curse for evermore!-- With violence and a curb's voiceless wrath.", " The theme which it treats, for instance, is a great theme in its own right; it is not a made-up story ingeniously handled. The trilogy of the _Oresteia_, of which this play is the first part, centres on the old and everlastingly unsolved problem of The ancient blinded vengeance and the wrong that amendeth wrong. Every wrong is justly punished; yet, as the world goes, every punishment becomes a new wrong, calling for fresh vengeance. And more; every wrong turns out to be itself rooted in some wrong of old. It is never gratuitous, never untempted by the working of Peitho (Persuasion), never merely wicked. The _Oresteia_ first shows the cycle of crime punished by crime which must be repunished, and then seeks for some gleam of escape, some breaking of the endless chain of \"evil duty.\" In the old order of earth and heaven there was no such escape. Each blow called for the return blow and must do so _ad infinitum_. But, according to Aeschylus, there is a new Ruler now in heaven, one who has both sinned and suffered and thereby grown wise. He is Zeus the Third Power, Zeus the Saviour, and his gift to mankind is the ability through suffering to Learn (pp. 7 f.) At the opening of the _Agamemnon_ we find Clytemnestra alienated from her husband and secretly befriended with his ancestral enemy, Aigisthos. The air is heavy and throbbing with hate; hate which is evil but has its due cause. Agamemnon, obeying the prophet Calchas, when the fleet lay storm-bound at Aulis, had given his own daughter, Iphigen\u00eea, as a human sacrifice.", " One there was who reigned of old, Big with wrath to brave and blast, Lo, his name is no more told! And who followed met at last His Third-thrower, and is gone. Only they whose hearts have known Zeus, the Conqueror and the Friend, They shall win their vision's end; Zeus the Guide, who made man turn Thought-ward, Zeus, who did ordain Man by Suffering shall Learn. So the heart of him, again Aching with remembered pain, Bleeds and sleepeth not, until Wisdom comes against his will. 'Tis the gift of One by strife Lifted to the throne of life. (AGAMEMNON _accepted the sign. Then came long delay, and storm while the fleet lay at Aulis._) So that day the Elder Lord, Marshal of the Achaian ships, Strove not with the prophet's word, Bowed him to his fate's eclipse, When with empty jars and lips Parched and seas impassable Fate on that Greek army fell, Fronting Chalcis as it lay, By Aulis in the swirling bay. (_Till at last Calchas answered that Artemis was wroth and demanded the death of_ AGAMEMNON'S _daughter. The King's doubt and grief_.) And winds, winds blew from Strymon River, Unharboured, starving, winds of waste endeavour, Man-blinding, pitiless to cord and bulwark, And the waste of days was made long, more long, Till the flower of Argos was aghast and withered; Then through the storm rose the War-seer's song, And told of medicine that should tame the tempest, But bow the Princes to a direr wrong.", " There is no doubt somewhere a _[Greek: pr\u00f4tarchos hAt\u00ea ]_, a \"first blind deed of wrong,\" but in practice every wrong is the result of another. And the Children of Atreus are steeped to the lips in them. When the prophetess Cassandra, out of her first vague horror at the evil House, begins to grope towards some definite image, first and most haunting comes the sound of the weeping of two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that was not theirs. From that point, more than any other, the Daemon or Genius of the House--more than its \"Luck,\" a little less than its Guardian Angel--becomes an Alastor or embodied Curse, a \"Red Slayer\" which cries ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only in the same blind way, through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through more vengeance (p. 69). This awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly groping towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it were, in the Cassandra story. That daughter of Priam was beloved by Apollo, who gave her the power of true prophecy. In some way that we know not, she broke her promise to the God; and, since his gift could not be recalled, he added to it the curse that, while she should always foresee and foretell the truth, none should believe her. The Cassandra scene is a creation beyond praise or criticism. The old scholiast speaks of the \"pity and amazement\" which it causes."], "The Chorus is made up of elder citizens from ___.": [" Lo, to this man the Gods have given Great Ilion in the dust to tread And home return, emblazed of heaven; If it is writ, he too shall go Through blood for blood spilt long ago; If he too, dying for the dead, Should crown the deaths of alien years, What mortal afar off, who hears, Shall boast him Fortune's Child, and led Above the eternal tide of tears?

The_ CHORUS _take position and begin their first Stasimon, or Standing-song,_ CHORUS. (_The sign seen on the way; Eagles tearing a hare with young_.) It is ours to tell of the Sign of the War-way given, To men more strong, (For a life that is kin unto ours yet breathes from heaven A spell, a Strength of Song:) How the twin-throned Might of Achaia, one Crown divided Above all Greeks that are, With avenging hand and spear upon Troy was guided By the Bird of War. 'Twas a King among birds to each of the Kings of the Sea, One Eagle black, one black but of fire-white tail, By the House, on the Spear-hand, in station that all might see; And they tore a hare, and the life in her womb that grew, Yea, the life unlived and the races unrun they slew. _Sorrow, sing sorrow: but good prevail, prevail_! (_How Calchas read the sign; his Vision of the Future_.) And the War-seer wise, as he looked on the Atreid Yoke Twain-tempered, knew Those fierce hare-renders the lords of his host; and spoke, Reading the omen true. \"At the last, the last, this Hunt hunteth Ilion down, Yea, and before the wall Violent division the fulness of land and town Shall waste withal; If only God's eye gloom not against our gates, And the great War-curb of Troy, fore-smitten, fail. For Pity lives, and those wing\u00e8d Hounds she hates, Which tore in the Trembler's body the unborn beast.", " _Ag\u00e2_ is sometimes called \"the jealousy of God,\" but such a translation is not happy. It is not the jealousy, nor even the indignation, of a personal God, but the profound repudiation and reversal of Hubris which is the very law of the Cosmos. Through all the triumph of the conqueror, this _Ag\u00e2_ abides. The greatest and most human character of the whole play is Clytemnestra. She is conceived on the grand Aeschylean scale, a scale which makes even Lady Macbeth and Beatrice Cenci seem small; she is more the kinswoman of Brynhild. Yet she is full not only of character, but of subtle psychology. She is the first and leading example of that time-honoured ornament of the tragic stage, the sympathetic, or semi-sympathetic, heroine-criminal. Aeschylus employs none of the devices of later playwrights to make her interesting. He admits, of course, no approach to a love-scene; he uses no sophisms; but he does make us see through Clytemnestra's eyes and feel through her passions. The agony of silent prayer in which, if my conception is right, we first see her, helps to interpret her speeches when they come; but every speech needs close study. She dare not speak sincerely or show her real feelings until Agamemnon is dead; and then she is practically a mad woman. For I think here that there is a point which has not been observed. It is that Clytemnestra is conceived as being really \"possessed\" by the Daemon of the House when she commits her crime.", " A marked contrast to Agamemnon, ll. 810 ff. Note that his first speech confirms all the worst fears suggested by Clytemnestra. Agamemnon has committed all the sins she prayed against, and more. The terrible lines 527 ff., \"Till her Gods' Houses, etc.,\" are very like a passage in the _Persae_, 811 ff., where exactly the same acts by the Persian invaders of Greece make their future punishment inevitable.

I think the tangling robe must have been in the tradition, as the murder in the bath certainly was. One motive, of course, is obvious: Clytemnestra is tempting Agamemnon to sin or \"go too far.\" He tries to resist, but the splendour of an oriental homecoming seduces him and he yields. But is that enough to account for such a curious trait in the story, and one so strongly emphasized? We are told afterwards that Clytemnestra threw over her victim an \"endless web,\" long and rich (p. 63), to prevent his seeing or using his arms. And I cannot help suspecting that this endless web was the same as the crimson pall. If one tries to conjecture the origin of this curious story, it is perhaps a clue to realize that the word _droit\u00ea_ means both a bath and a sarcophagus, or rather that the thing called droit\u00ea, a narrow stone or marble vessel about seven feet long, was in pre-classical and post-classical times used as a sarcophagus, but in classical times chiefly or solely as a bath. If among the prehistoric graves at Mycenae some later peasants discovered a royal mummy or skeleton in a sarcophagus, wrapped in a robe of royal crimson, and showing signs of violent death--such as Schliemann believed that he discovered--would they not say: \"We found the body of a King murdered in a bath, and wrapped round and round in a great robe?\" P. 39 f.]--Agamemnon is going through the process of temptation.", " \"The life of the Year-Daemon, who lies at the root of so many Greek gods and heroes, is normally a story of Pride and Punishment.

Observe how, during the lyric scene, Cassandra's vision grows steadily more definite: First vague horror of the House: then the sobbing of children, slain long ago: then, a new deed of blood coming; a woman in it: a wife: then, with a great effort, an attempt to describe the actual slaying in the bath. Lastly, the sight of herself among the slain. (This last point is greatly developed by Euripides, _Trojan Women_, ll. 445 ff., pp. 33 f.). The story of the Children of Thyestes is given below, ll. 1590 ff., p. 73. Procn\u00ea (or Philom\u00eala) was an Attic princess who, in fury against her Thracian husband, Tereus, killed their child Itys, or Itylus, and was changed into a nightingale, to weep for him for ever. P. 52, ll. 1178 ff.]--Dialogue. During the lyrics Cassandra has been \"possessed\" or \"entranced\": the turn to dialogue marks a conscious attempt to control herself and state plainly her message of warning. In order to prove her power, she first tells the Elders of deeds done in the past which are known to them but cannot have been known to her. When once they are convinced of her true seercraft, she will be able to warn them of what is coming!--The short 'stichom[^y]thia'[**TR: This is a y with a circumflex, not a superscript.] (line for line dialogue), dealing in awed whispers with things which can hardly be spoken, leaves the story of Cassandra still a mystery.

Probably it was really some ordinary New Year and Old Year celebration to which the poets give a tragic touch. It seems to have had a woman's \"Ololugmos\" in it, perhaps uttered by men. See Kaibel's note, Soph. _Electra_ 277-281. P. 26, l. 612, Bronze be dyed like wool.] --Impossible in the literal sense, but there is after all a way of dying a sword red!

Menelaus was away, wrecked or wind-bound. P. 28, l. 642, Two-fold scourge.] --Ares works his will when spear crosses spear, when man meets man. Hence \"two-fold.\" P. 29, CHORUS.

Indeed thou conquerest me. Men say, the light In old men's eyes yet serves to learn aright. But Clytemnestra and the House should hear These tidings first, though I their health may share. [_During the last words_ CLYTEMNESTRA _has entered from the Palace_. CLYTEMNESTRA. Long since I lifted up my voice in joy, When the first messenger from flaming Troy Spake through the dark of sack and overthrow. And mockers chid me: \"Because beacons show On the hills, must Troy be fallen? Quickly born Are women's hopes!\" Aye, many did me scorn; Yet gave I sacrifice; and by my word Through all the city our woman's cry was heard, Lifted in blessing round the seats of God, And slumbrous incense o'er the altars glowed In fragrance. And for thee, what need to tell Thy further tale? My lord himself shall well Instruct me. Yet, to give my lord and king All reverent greeting at his homecoming-- What dearer dawn on woman's eyes can flame Than this, which casteth wide her gate to acclaim The husband whom God leadeth safe from war?-- Go, bear my lord this prayer: That fast and far He haste him to this town which loves his name; And in his castle may he find the same Wife that he left, a watchdog of the hall, True to one voice and fierce to others all; A body and soul unchanged, no seal of his Broke in the waiting years.--No thought of ease Nor joy from other men hath touched my soul, Nor shall touch, until bronze be dyed like wool."], "Whose terrible death at the hands of Agamemnon is described in detail by the Chorus?": [" CHORUS. (_Some Elders_.) Would God that suddenly With no great agony, No long sick-watch to keep, My hour would come to me, My hour, and presently Bring the eternal, the Unwaking Sleep, Now that my Shepherd, he Whose love watched over me, Lies in the deep! ANOTHER. For woman's sake he endured and battled well, And by a woman's hand he fell. OTHERS. What hast thou done, O Helen blind of brain, O face that slew the souls on Ilion's plain, One face, one face, and many a thousand slain? The hate of old that on this castle lay, Builded in lust, a husband's evil day, Hath bloomed for thee a perfect flower again And unforgotten, an old and burning stain Never to pass away. CLYTEMNESTRA. Nay, pray not for the hour of death, being tried Too sore beneath these blows Neither on Helen turn thy wrath aside, The Slayer of Men, the face which hath destroyed Its thousand Danaan souls, and wrought a wide Wound that no leech can close. CHORUS. --Daemon, whose heel is set On the House and the twofold kin Of the high Tantalidae, A power, heavy as fate, Thou wieldest through woman's sin, Piercing the heart of me! --Like a raven swoln with hate He hath set on the dead his claw, He croaketh a song to sate His fury, and calls it Law! CLYTEMNESTRA. Ah, call upon Him! Yea, call-- And thy thought hath found its path-- The Daemon who haunts this hall, The thrice-engorged Wrath; From him is the ache of the flesh For blood born and increased; Ere the old sore hath ceased It oozeth afresh.", " The Elders who talk with her wish to believe, they try to understand, they are really convinced of Cassandra's powers. But the curse is too strong. The special thing which Cassandra tries again and again to say always eludes them, and they can raise no finger to prevent the disaster happening. And when it does happen they are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, \"dreams wandering in the daylight.\" The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further significance which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the incarnation of that knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (Hdt. ix. 16). Agamemnon himself, the King of Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol of pride and the fall of pride. We must not think of him as bad or specially cruel. The watchman loved him (ll. 34 f.), and the lamentations of the Elders over his death have a note of personal affection (pp. 66 ff.). But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that [Greek: Aga mimnei], \"the unseen Wrath abides.\" _Ag\u00e2_, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is more like Nemesis, the feeling that something is [Greek: agan], \"too much,\" the condemnation of _Hubris_ (pride or overgrowth) and of all things that are in excess.", " MOURNERS.

I think the seers attached to the royal household (cf. _Libation-Bearers,_ l. 37, where they are summoned to read a dream) were rather like what we call clairvoyants.

And one who was really charged with Victory, like Agamemnon, was very valuable to his friends and people. Hence they made statues of Victory wingless--so that she should not fly away. See _Four Stages of Greek Religion_, p. 138 note. P. 36, Clytemnestra.] --A wonderful speech. It seems to me that Aeschylus' imagination realized all the confused passions in Clytemnestra's mind, but that his art was not yet sufficiently developed to make them all clear and explicit. She is in suspense; does Agamemnon know her guilt or not? At least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to justify or excuse herself in the eyes of the world. A touch of hysteria creeps in; why could he not have been killed in all these years? Why must he rise, like some monster from the grave, unkillable? Gradually she recovers her calm, explains clearly the suspicious point of Orestes' absence, and heaps up her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which Agamemnon rebukes, ll. 918 ff., p. 39). Again, at the end, when she finds that for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out.", " Even now in smoke that City tells her tale; The wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died The reek of the old fatness of her pride From hot and writhing ashes rolls afar.

Lo, to the Gods I make these thanksgivings. But for thy words: I marked them, and I mind Their meaning, and my voice shall be behind Thine. For not many men, the proverb saith, Can love a friend whom fortune prospereth Unenvying; and about the envious brain Cold poison clings, and doubles all the pain Life brings him.

Homer (Od. iii. 309 f.) derives it from a rejoicing by Orestes over Aigisthos and Clytemnestra; cf. below, ll. 1316 ff., p. 59; Aeschylus here and Sophocles in the _Electra_, from a celebration by Clytemnestra of the deaths of Agamemnon and Cassandra. Probably it was really some ordinary New Year and Old Year celebration to which the poets give a tragic touch. It seems to have had a woman's \"Ololugmos\" in it, perhaps uttered by men.

P. 27, l. 617, Menelaus.] --This digression about Menelaus is due, as similar digressions generally are when they occur in Greek plays, to the poet feeling bound to follow the tradition. Homer begins his longest account of the slaying of Agamemnon by asking \"Where was Menelaus?\" (Od. iii. 249). Agamemnon could be safely attacked because he was alone. Menelaus was away, wrecked or wind-bound. P. 28, l. 642, Two-fold scourge.] --Ares works his will when spear crosses spear, when man meets man. Hence \"two-fold.\" P. 29, CHORUS.

And when it does happen they are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, \"dreams wandering in the daylight.\" The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further significance which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the incarnation of that knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (Hdt. ix. 16). Agamemnon himself, the King of Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol of pride and the fall of pride. We must not think of him as bad or specially cruel.

But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that [Greek: Aga mimnei], \"the unseen Wrath abides.\" _Ag\u00e2_, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is more like Nemesis, the feeling that something is [Greek: agan], \"too much,\" the condemnation of _Hubris_ (pride or overgrowth) and of all things that are in excess."], "What does the Chorus identify as the meaning of Helen\u2019s name?": [" [_Exit_ HERALD. _The_ CHORUS _take position for the Third Stasimon_.

Yea, in fate's derision, Hell in cities, Hell in ships, Hell in hearts of men they knew her, When the dim and delicate fold Of her curtains backward rolled, And to sea, to sea, she threw her In the West Wind's giant hold; And with spear and sword behind her Came the hunters in a flood, Down the oarblade's viewless trail Tracking, till in Simo\u00efs' vale Through the leaves they crept to find her, A Wrath, a seed of blood. (_The Trojans welcomed her with triumph and praised Alexander till at last their song changed and they saw another meaning in Alexander's name also._) So the Name to Ilion came On God's thought-fulfilling flame, She a vengeance and a token Of the unfaith to bread broken, Of the hearth of God betrayed, Against them whose voices swelled Glorying in the prize they held And the Spoiler's vaunt outspoken And the song his brethren made 'Mid the bridal torches burning; Till, behold, the ancient City Of King Priam turned, and turning Took a new song for her learning, A song changed and full of pity, With the cry of a lost nation; And she changed the bridegroom's name: Called him Paris Ghastly-wed; For her sons were with the dead, And her life one lamentation, 'Mid blood and burning flame.", " Was it mere accident, and could you change the name of anything at will? Or was language a thing rooted in nature and fixed by God from of old? Aeschylus adopts the latter view: Why was this being called Helena? If one had understood God's purpose one would have seen it was because she really _was_ \"Helen\u00e2s\"--_Ship-destroyer_. (The Herald's story of the shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) Similarly, if a hero was called Aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called from 'Aiai,' \"Alas!\" --The antistrophe seems to find a meaning in the name Paris or Alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear. Pp. 33 ff.] --Entrance of Agamemnon. The metre of the Chorus indicates marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across the orchestra and get into position. Cassandra would be dressed, as a prophetess, in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an _agr\u00eanon_, or net of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and certain fillets or crowns. The Leader welcomes the King: he explains that, though he was against the war ten years ago, and has not changed his opinion, he is a faithful servant of the King ... and that not all are equally so.

One would like to know whether Aeschylus made them speak together confusedly, as would certainly be done on the modern stage, or whether the stately conventions of Greek tragedy preferred that each speaker should finish his say. In any case, what happens is that after a moment or two of confused counsel the Elders determine to break into the Palace, but as they are mounting the steps the great doors are flung open and Clytemnestra confronts them, standing over the dead bodies of Agamemnon and Cassandra. The illusion intended is that the Elders have entered the Palace and discovered Clytemnestra.

And the Children of Atreus are steeped to the lips in them. When the prophetess Cassandra, out of her first vague horror at the evil House, begins to grope towards some definite image, first and most haunting comes the sound of the weeping of two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that was not theirs. From that point, more than any other, the Daemon or Genius of the House--more than its \"Luck,\" a little less than its Guardian Angel--becomes an Alastor or embodied Curse, a \"Red Slayer\" which cries ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only in the same blind way, through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through more vengeance (p. 69). This awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly groping towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it were, in the Cassandra story. That daughter of Priam was beloved by Apollo, who gave her the power of true prophecy. In some way that we know not, she broke her promise to the God; and, since his gift could not be recalled, he added to it the curse that, while she should always foresee and foretell the truth, none should believe her.

The majestic art, the creative genius, the instinctive eloquence of these plays--that eloquence which is the mere despair of a translator--are all devoted to the expression of something which Aeschylus felt to be of tremendous import. It was not his discovery; but it was a truth of which he had an intense realization. It had become something which he must with all his strength bring to expression before he died, not in a spirit of self-assertion or of argument, like a discoverer, but as one devoted to something higher and greater than himself, in the spirit of an interpreter or prophet.

Or was language a thing rooted in nature and fixed by God from of old? Aeschylus adopts the latter view: Why was this being called Helena? If one had understood God's purpose one would have seen it was because she really _was_ \"Helen\u00e2s\"--_Ship-destroyer_. (The Herald's story of the shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) Similarly, if a hero was called Aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called from 'Aiai,' \"Alas!\" --The antistrophe seems to find a meaning in the name Paris or Alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear. Pp. 33 ff.] --Entrance of Agamemnon. The metre of the Chorus indicates marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across the orchestra and get into position. Cassandra would be dressed, as a prophetess, in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an _agr\u00eanon_, or net of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and certain fillets or crowns. The Leader welcomes the King: he explains that, though he was against the war ten years ago, and has not changed his opinion, he is a faithful servant of the King ... and that not all are equally so. He gave a similar hint to the Herald above, ll. 546-550, p. 24.

He is so full of triumph and success; he must be very careful not to provoke a fall.--Victory, Nike, was to the Greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. It clung to you or it deserted you. And one who was really charged with Victory, like Agamemnon, was very valuable to his friends and people. Hence they made statues of Victory wingless--so that she should not fly away. See _Four Stages of Greek Religion_, p. 138 note. P. 36, Clytemnestra.] --A wonderful speech. It seems to me that Aeschylus' imagination realized all the confused passions in Clytemnestra's mind, but that his art was not yet sufficiently developed to make them all clear and explicit. She is in suspense; does Agamemnon know her guilt or not? At least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to justify or excuse herself in the eyes of the world. A touch of hysteria creeps in; why could he not have been killed in all these years? Why must he rise, like some monster from the grave, unkillable? Gradually she recovers her calm, explains clearly the suspicious point of Orestes' absence, and heaps up her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which Agamemnon rebukes, ll. 918 ff., p. 39). Again, at the end, when she finds that for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out.", " Her stole of saffron then to the ground she threw, And her eye with an arrow of pity found its path To each man's heart that slew: A face in a picture, striving amazedly; The little maid who danced at her father's board, The innocent voice man's love came never nigh, Who joined to his her little paean-cry When the third cup was poured.... What came thereafter I saw not neither tell. But the craft of Calchas failed not.--'Tis written, He Who Suffereth Shall Learn; the law holdeth well. And that which is to be, Ye will know at last; why weep before the hour? For come it shall, as out of darkness dawn. Only may good from all this evil flower; So prays this Heart of Argos, this frail tower Guarding the land alone. [_As they cease,_ CLYTEMNESTRA _comes from the Palace with Attendants.

But One there is who heareth on high Some Pan or Zeus, some lost Apollo-- That keen bird-throated suffering cry Of the stranger wronged in God's own sky; And sendeth down, for the law transgressed, The Wrath of the Feet that follow.

RUSKIN HOUSE, 40 MUSEUM STREET, W.C. PREFACE The sense of difficulty, and indeed of awe, with which a scholar approaches the task of translating the _Agamemnon_ depends directly on its greatness as poetry. It is in part a matter of diction. The language of Aeschylus is an extraordinary thing, the syntax stiff and simple, the vocabulary obscure, unexpected, and steeped in splendour. Its peculiarities cannot be disregarded, or the translation will be false in character. Yet not Milton himself could produce in English the same great music, and a translator who should strive ambitiously to represent the complex effect of the original would clog his own powers of expression and strain his instrument to breaking. But, apart from the diction in this narrower sense, there is a quality of atmosphere surrounding the _Agamemnon_ which seems almost to defy reproduction in another setting, because it depends in large measure on the position of the play in the historical development of Greek literature. If we accept the view that all Art to some extent, and Greek tragedy in a very special degree, moves in its course of development from Religion to Entertainment, from a Service to a Performance, the _Agamemnon_ seems to stand at a critical point where the balance of the two elements is near perfection."], "Who tells Cassandra to \u201ctake up the yoke that shall be yours\u201d?": [" Even now in smoke that City tells her tale; The wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died The reek of the old fatness of her pride From hot and writhing ashes rolls afar. For which let thanks, wide as our glories are, Be uplifted; seeing the Beast of Argos hath Round Ilion's towers piled high his fence of wrath And, for one woman ravished, wrecked by force A City. Lo, the leap of the wild Horse in darkness when the Pleiades were dead; A mailed multitude, a Lion unfed, Which leapt the tower and lapt the blood of Kings! Lo, to the Gods I make these thanksgivings. But for thy words: I marked them, and I mind Their meaning, and my voice shall be behind Thine. For not many men, the proverb saith, Can love a friend whom fortune prospereth Unenvying; and about the envious brain Cold poison clings, and doubles all the pain Life brings him. His own woundings he must nurse, And feels another's gladness like a curse. Well can I speak. I know the mirrored glass Called friendship, and the shadow shapes that pass And feign them a King's friends. I have known but one-- Odysseus, him we trapped against his own Will!--who once harnessed bore his yoke right well ... Be he alive or dead of whom I tell The tale. And for the rest, touching our state And gods, we will assemble in debate A concourse of all Argos, taking sure Counsel, that what is well now may endure Well, and if aught needs healing medicine, still By cutting and by fire, with all good will, I will essay to avert the after-wrack Such sickness breeds.", " From these, I warn ye, vengeance broodeth still, A lion's rage, which goes not forth to kill But lurketh in his lair, watching the high Hall of my war-gone master ... Master? Aye; Mine, mine! The yoke is nailed about my neck....

Slay a strong and arm\u00e8d man? ... What fang\u00e8d reptile like to her doth creep? Some serpent amphisbene, some Skylla, deep Housed in the rock, where sailors shriek and die, Mother of Hell blood-raging, which doth cry On her own flesh war, war without alloy ... God! And she shouted in his face her joy, Like men in battle when the foe doth break. And feigns thanksgiving for his safety's sake! What if no man believe me? 'Tis all one. The thing which must be shall be; aye, and soon Thou too shalt sorrow for these things, and here Standing confess me all too true a seer. LEADER. The Thyestean feast of children slain I understood, and tremble. Aye, my brain Reels at these visions, beyond guesswork true. But after, though I heard, I had lost the clue. CASSANDRA.

A painted show Is all thy glory; and when life is low The touch of a wet sponge out-blotteth all. Oh, sadder this than any proud man's fall! [_She goes into the House._ CHORUS. Great Fortune is an hungry thing, And filleth no heart anywhere, Though men with fingers menacing Point at the great house, none will dare, When Fortune knocks, to bar the door Proclaiming: \"Come thou here no more!\""], "The first time Cassandra speaks, who does she cry out to?": [" There is no doubt somewhere a _[Greek: pr\u00f4tarchos hAt\u00ea ]_, a \"first blind deed of wrong,\" but in practice every wrong is the result of another. And the Children of Atreus are steeped to the lips in them. When the prophetess Cassandra, out of her first vague horror at the evil House, begins to grope towards some definite image, first and most haunting comes the sound of the weeping of two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that was not theirs. From that point, more than any other, the Daemon or Genius of the House--more than its \"Luck,\" a little less than its Guardian Angel--becomes an Alastor or embodied Curse, a \"Red Slayer\" which cries ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only in the same blind way, through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through more vengeance (p. 69). This awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly groping towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it were, in the Cassandra story. That daughter of Priam was beloved by Apollo, who gave her the power of true prophecy. In some way that we know not, she broke her promise to the God; and, since his gift could not be recalled, he added to it the curse that, while she should always foresee and foretell the truth, none should believe her. The Cassandra scene is a creation beyond praise or criticism. The old scholiast speaks of the \"pity and amazement\" which it causes.", " Am I a poor Dreamer, that begs and babbles at the door? Give first thine oath in witness, that I know Of this great dome the sins wrought long ago. ELDER. And how should oath of mine, though bravely sworn, Appease thee? Yet I marvel that one born Far over seas, of alien speech, should fall So apt, as though she had lived here and seen all. CASSANDRA. The Seer Apollo made me too to see. ELDER (_in a low voice_). Was the God's heart pierced with desire for thee? CASSANDRA. Time was, I held it shame hereof to speak. ELDER. Ah, shame is for the mighty, not the weak. CASSANDRA. We wrestled, and his breath to me was sweet. ELDER. Ye came to the getting of children, as is meet? CASSANDRA. I swore to Loxias, and I swore a lie. ELDER. Already thine the gift of prophecy? CASSANDRA. Already I showed my people all their path. ELDER. And Loxias did not smite thee in his wrath? CASSANDRA. After that sin ... no man believed me more. ELDER. Nay, then, to us thy wisdom seemeth sure. CASSANDRA. Oh, oh! Agony, agony! Again the awful pains of prophecy Are on me, maddening as they fall.... Ye see them there ... beating against the wall? So young ... like shapes that gather in a dream ... Slain by a hand they loved. Children they seem, Murdered ... and in their hands they bear baked meat: I think it is themselves.

(_Some Elders_.) Would God that suddenly With no great agony, No long sick-watch to keep, My hour would come to me, My hour, and presently Bring the eternal, the Unwaking Sleep, Now that my Shepherd, he Whose love watched over me, Lies in the deep! ANOTHER. For woman's sake he endured and battled well, And by a woman's hand he fell. OTHERS. What hast thou done, O Helen blind of brain, O face that slew the souls on Ilion's plain, One face, one face, and many a thousand slain? The hate of old that on this castle lay, Builded in lust, a husband's evil day, Hath bloomed for thee a perfect flower again And unforgotten, an old and burning stain Never to pass away. CLYTEMNESTRA. Nay, pray not for the hour of death, being tried Too sore beneath these blows Neither on Helen turn thy wrath aside, The Slayer of Men, the face which hath destroyed Its thousand Danaan souls, and wrought a wide Wound that no leech can close. CHORUS. --Daemon, whose heel is set On the House and the twofold kin Of the high Tantalidae, A power, heavy as fate, Thou wieldest through woman's sin, Piercing the heart of me! --Like a raven swoln with hate He hath set on the dead his claw, He croaketh a song to sate His fury, and calls it Law! CLYTEMNESTRA. Ah, call upon Him! Yea, call-- And thy thought hath found its path-- The Daemon who haunts this hall, The thrice-engorged Wrath; From him is the ache of the flesh For blood born and increased; Ere the old sore hath ceased It oozeth afresh.", " (_Like a lion's whelp reared as a pet and turning afterwards to a great beast of prey,_) Lo, once there was a herdsman reared In his own house, so stories tell, A lion's whelp, a milk-fed thing And soft in life's first opening Among the sucklings of the herd; The happy children loved him well, And old men smiled, and oft, they say, In men's arms, like a babe, he lay, Bright-eyed, and toward the hand that teased him Eagerly fawning for food or play. Then on a day outflashed the sudden Rage of the lion brood of yore; He paid his debt to them that fed With wrack of herds and carnage red, Yea, wrought him a great feast unbidden, Till all the house-ways ran with gore; A sight the thralls fled weeping from, A great red slayer, beard a-foam, High-priest of some blood-curs\u00e8d altar God had uplifted against that home. (_So was it with Helen in Troy._) And how shall I call the thing that came At the first hour to Ilion city? Call it a dream of peace untold, A secret joy in a mist of gold, A woman's eye that was soft, like flame, A flower which ate a man's heart with pity. But she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending, And a wrath was on her harbouring, a wrath upon her friending, When to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o'er the deep, With the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind, A death-bride, whom brides long shall weep. (_Men say that Good Fortune wakes the envy of God; not so; Good Fortune may be innocent, and then there is no vengeance_.)", " For Atreus, this man's father, in this land Reigning, and by Thyestes in his throne Challenged--he was his brother and mine own Father From home and city cast him out; And he, after long exile, turned about And threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won Promise of so much mercy, that his own Life-blood should reek not in his father's hall. Then did that godless brother, Atreus, call, To greet my sire--More eagerness, O God, Was there than love!--a feast of brotherhood. And, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat Before him his dead children. The white feet And finger-fring\u00e8d hands apart he set, Veiled from all seeing, and made separate The tables. And he straightway, knowing naught, Took of those bodies, eating that which wrought No health for all his race. And when he knew The unnatural deed, back from the board he threw, Spewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake The table, to make strong the curse he spake: \"Thus perish all of Pleisthen\u00eas begot!\" For that lies this man here; and all the plot Is mine, most righteously. For me, the third, When butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared And cast me with my broken sire that day, A little thing in swaddling clothes, away To exile; where I grew, and at the last Justice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast In a far land, mine arm hath reached this king; My brain, my hate, wrought all the counselling; And all is well.

Then on a day outflashed the sudden Rage of the lion brood of yore; He paid his debt to them that fed With wrack of herds and carnage red, Yea, wrought him a great feast unbidden, Till all the house-ways ran with gore; A sight the thralls fled weeping from, A great red slayer, beard a-foam, High-priest of some blood-curs\u00e8d altar God had uplifted against that home. (_So was it with Helen in Troy._) And how shall I call the thing that came At the first hour to Ilion city? Call it a dream of peace untold, A secret joy in a mist of gold, A woman's eye that was soft, like flame, A flower which ate a man's heart with pity. But she swerved aside and wrought to her kiss a bitter ending, And a wrath was on her harbouring, a wrath upon her friending, When to Priam and his sons she fled quickly o'er the deep, With the god to whom she sinned for her watcher on the wind, A death-bride, whom brides long shall weep.

I think the tangling robe must have been in the tradition, as the murder in the bath certainly was. One motive, of course, is obvious: Clytemnestra is tempting Agamemnon to sin or \"go too far.\" He tries to resist, but the splendour of an oriental homecoming seduces him and he yields. But is that enough to account for such a curious trait in the story, and one so strongly emphasized? We are told afterwards that Clytemnestra threw over her victim an \"endless web,\" long and rich (p. 63), to prevent his seeing or using his arms. And I cannot help suspecting that this endless web was the same as the crimson pall. If one tries to conjecture the origin of this curious story, it is perhaps a clue to realize that the word _droit\u00ea_ means both a bath and a sarcophagus, or rather that the thing called droit\u00ea, a narrow stone or marble vessel about seven feet long, was in pre-classical and post-classical times used as a sarcophagus, but in classical times chiefly or solely as a bath. If among the prehistoric graves at Mycenae some later peasants discovered a royal mummy or skeleton in a sarcophagus, wrapped in a robe of royal crimson, and showing signs of violent death--such as Schliemann believed that he discovered--would they not say: \"We found the body of a King murdered in a bath, and wrapped round and round in a great robe?\" P. 39 f.]--Agamemnon is going through the process of temptation."], "Before being killed, where was Agamemnon trapped?": [" Those who have dared to be false shall be broken.--At the end comes a note of fear, like the fear in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. He is so full of triumph and success; he must be very careful not to provoke a fall.--Victory, Nike, was to the Greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. It clung to you or it deserted you. And one who was really charged with Victory, like Agamemnon, was very valuable to his friends and people. Hence they made statues of Victory wingless--so that she should not fly away. See _Four Stages of Greek Religion_, p. 138 note. P. 36, Clytemnestra.] --A wonderful speech. It seems to me that Aeschylus' imagination realized all the confused passions in Clytemnestra's mind, but that his art was not yet sufficiently developed to make them all clear and explicit. She is in suspense; does Agamemnon know her guilt or not? At least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to justify or excuse herself in the eyes of the world. A touch of hysteria creeps in; why could he not have been killed in all these years? Why must he rise, like some monster from the grave, unkillable? Gradually she recovers her calm, explains clearly the suspicious point of Orestes' absence, and heaps up her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which Agamemnon rebukes, ll. 918 ff., p. 39). Again, at the end, when she finds that for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out.", " Even now in smoke that City tells her tale; The wrack-wind liveth, and where Ilion died The reek of the old fatness of her pride From hot and writhing ashes rolls afar.

TANTALUS | Pelops | --------------------------- | | Atreus Thyestes | | ----------------- | | | | Agamemnon Menelaus Aigisthos (= Clytemnestra) (= Helen) (= Clytemnestra) | ------------------------ | | | Iphigenia Electra Orestes (Also, a sister of Agamemnon, name variously given, married Strophios, and was the mother of Pylades.)"], "It\u2019s revealed that ___ was tricked into eating his own children by Atreus, Agamemnon\u2019s father.": [" For Atreus, this man's father, in this land Reigning, and by Thyestes in his throne Challenged--he was his brother and mine own Father From home and city cast him out; And he, after long exile, turned about And threw him suppliant on the hearth, and won Promise of so much mercy, that his own Life-blood should reek not in his father's hall. Then did that godless brother, Atreus, call, To greet my sire--More eagerness, O God, Was there than love!--a feast of brotherhood. And, feigning joyous banquet, laid as meat Before him his dead children. The white feet And finger-fring\u00e8d hands apart he set, Veiled from all seeing, and made separate The tables. And he straightway, knowing naught, Took of those bodies, eating that which wrought No health for all his race. And when he knew The unnatural deed, back from the board he threw, Spewing that murderous gorge, and spurning brake The table, to make strong the curse he spake: \"Thus perish all of Pleisthen\u00eas begot!\" For that lies this man here; and all the plot Is mine, most righteously. For me, the third, When butchering my two brethren, Atreus spared And cast me with my broken sire that day, A little thing in swaddling clothes, away To exile; where I grew, and at the last Justice hath brought me home! Yea though outcast In a far land, mine arm hath reached this king; My brain, my hate, wrought all the counselling; And all is well. I have seen mine enemy Dead in the snare, and care not if I die!", " There is no doubt somewhere a _[Greek: pr\u00f4tarchos hAt\u00ea ]_, a \"first blind deed of wrong,\" but in practice every wrong is the result of another. And the Children of Atreus are steeped to the lips in them. When the prophetess Cassandra, out of her first vague horror at the evil House, begins to grope towards some definite image, first and most haunting comes the sound of the weeping of two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that was not theirs. From that point, more than any other, the Daemon or Genius of the House--more than its \"Luck,\" a little less than its Guardian Angel--becomes an Alastor or embodied Curse, a \"Red Slayer\" which cries ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only in the same blind way, through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through more vengeance (p. 69). This awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly groping towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it were, in the Cassandra story. That daughter of Priam was beloved by Apollo, who gave her the power of true prophecy. In some way that we know not, she broke her promise to the God; and, since his gift could not be recalled, he added to it the curse that, while she should always foresee and foretell the truth, none should believe her. The Cassandra scene is a creation beyond praise or criticism. The old scholiast speaks of the \"pity and amazement\" which it causes.", " \"The life of the Year-Daemon, who lies at the root of so many Greek gods and heroes, is normally a story of Pride and Punishment.

And they burn with longing.--O God may the end be well!\" (_But ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his daughter, Iphigenia, as a sacrifice._) To the yoke of Must-Be he bowed him slowly, And a strange wind within his bosom tossed, A wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy; And he rose up, daring to the uttermost.

But the curse is too strong. The special thing which Cassandra tries again and again to say always eludes them, and they can raise no finger to prevent the disaster happening. And when it does happen they are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, \"dreams wandering in the daylight.\" The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further significance which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the incarnation of that knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (Hdt. ix. 16). Agamemnon himself, the King of Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol of pride and the fall of pride. We must not think of him as bad or specially cruel. The watchman loved him (ll. 34 f.), and the lamentations of the Elders over his death have a note of personal affection (pp. 66 ff.). But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that [Greek: Aga mimnei], \"the unseen Wrath abides.\" _Ag\u00e2_, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is more like Nemesis, the feeling that something is [Greek: agan], \"too much,\" the condemnation of _Hubris_ (pride or overgrowth) and of all things that are in excess.", " And if of all these strifes we now may have no more, oh, I will kneel And praise God, bruis\u00e8d though we be beneath the Daemon's heavy heel.

I have seen mine enemy Dead in the snare, and care not if I die!", " ix. 11). Observe how, during the lyric scene, Cassandra's vision grows steadily more definite: First vague horror of the House: then the sobbing of children, slain long ago: then, a new deed of blood coming; a woman in it: a wife: then, with a great effort, an attempt to describe the actual slaying in the bath. Lastly, the sight of herself among the slain. (This last point is greatly developed by Euripides, _Trojan Women_, ll. 445 ff., pp. 33 f.). The story of the Children of Thyestes is given below, ll. 1590 ff., p. 73. Procn\u00ea (or Philom\u00eala) was an Attic princess who, in fury against her Thracian husband, Tereus, killed their child Itys, or Itylus, and was changed into a nightingale, to weep for him for ever. P. 52, ll. 1178 ff.]--Dialogue. During the lyrics Cassandra has been \"possessed\" or \"entranced\": the turn to dialogue marks a conscious attempt to control herself and state plainly her message of warning. In order to prove her power, she first tells the Elders of deeds done in the past which are known to them but cannot have been known to her. When once they are convinced of her true seercraft, she will be able to warn them of what is coming!--The short 'stichom[^y]thia'[**TR: This is a y with a circumflex, not a superscript.] (line for line dialogue), dealing in awed whispers with things which can hardly be spoken, leaves the story of Cassandra still a mystery. Then her self-control breaks and the power of the God sweeps irresistibly upon her; cf."], "At the end of the play, what do Aegistheus and Clytemnestra do?": [" We are supposed to be inside the house; but as a matter of fact the supposition is soon forgotten, and the play goes on without any attention to the particular place of the action.

And still I await the sign, the beacon pyre That bears Troy's capture on a voice of flame Shouting o'erseas. So surely to her aim Cleaveth a woman's heart, man-passioned!", " The drama has come fully to life, but the religion has not yet faded to a formality. The _Agamemnon_ is not, like Aeschylus' _Suppliant Women_, a statue half-hewn out of the rock. It is a real play, showing clash of character and situation, suspense and movement, psychological depth and subtlety. Yet it still remains something more than a play. Its atmosphere is not quite of this world. In the long lyrics especially one feels that the guiding emotion is not the entertainer's wish to thrill an audience, not even perhaps the pure artist's wish to create beauty, but something deeper and more prophetic, a passionate contemplation and expression of truth; though of course the truth in question is something felt rather than stated, something that pervades life, an eternal and majestic rhythm like the movement of the stars. Thus, if Longinus is right in defining Sublimity as \"the ring, or resonance, of greatness of soul,\" one sees in part where the sublimity of the _Agamemnon_ comes from. And it is worth noting that the faults which some critics have found in the play are in harmony with this conclusion. For the sublimity that is rooted in religion tolerates some faults and utterly refuses to tolerate others. The _Agamemnon_ may be slow in getting to work; it may be stiff with antique conventions. It never approaches to being cheap or insincere or shallow or sentimental or showy. It never ceases to be genuinely a \"criticism of life.\"", " II.

Pp. 3 f., ll. 40 ff.] --With this silent scene of Clytemnestra's, compare the long silence of Cassandra below, and the silence of Prometheus in that play until his torturers have left him. See the criticism of Aeschylus in Aristophanes, _Frogs_, ll. 911-920, pp. 68, 69 in my translation. P. 5, l. 104, Sign of the War-Way.]--i.e. an ominous sign seen by the army as it started on its journey. In Homer, Iliad, ll. 305-329, it is a snake which eats the nine young of a mother bird and then the mother, and is turned into stone afterwards.--All through this chorus the language of the prophet Calchas is intentionally obscure and riddling--the style of prophesy. P. 7, l. 146, But I-\u00ea, i-\u00ea.] --(Pronounce _Ee-ay_.) Calchas, catching sight in his vision of the further consequences which Artemis will exact if she fulfils the sign, calls on Apollo Paian, the Healer, to check her."]}
