{"Whom does Myshkin meet on the train at the beginning of the novel?": [" I will just add, however, that Georges Dandin might have existed exactly as Moli\u00e8re presented him, and probably does exist now and then, though rarely; and so I will end this scientific examination, which is beginning to look like a newspaper criticism. But for all this, the question remains,--what are the novelists to do with commonplace people, and how are they to be presented to the reader in such a form as to be in the least degree interesting? They cannot be left out altogether, for commonplace people meet one at every turn of life, and to leave them out would be to destroy the whole reality and probability of the story. To fill a novel with typical characters only, or with merely strange and uncommon people, would render the book unreal and improbable, and would very likely destroy the interest. In my opinion, the duty of the novelist is to seek out points of interest and instruction even in the characters of commonplace people.", " This was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Gania\u2019s new green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in order to impress her. He was very deeply mortified. II. It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St. Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the family had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide him.", " \u201cTake me away, anywhere you like, quick!\u201d Rogojin seized her in his arms and almost carried her to the carriage. Then, in a flash, he tore a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket and held it to the coachman. \u201cTo the station, quick! If you catch the train you shall have another. Quick!\u201d He leaped into the carriage after Nastasia and banged the door. The coachman did not hesitate a moment; he whipped up the horses, and they were off. \u201cOne more second and I should have stopped him,\u201d said Keller, afterwards. In fact, he and Burdovsky jumped into another carriage and set off in pursuit; but it struck them as they drove along that it was not much use trying to bring Nastasia back by force. \u201cBesides,\u201d said Burdovsky, \u201cthe prince would not like it, would he?\u201d So they gave up the pursuit. Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna reached the station just in time for the train. As he jumped out of the carriage and was almost on the point of entering the train, Rogojin accosted a young girl standing on the platform and wearing an old-fashioned, but respectable-looking, black cloak and a silk handkerchief over her head.", " \u201cWell, bring them, with or without respect, provided always you do not drop them on the way; but on the condition,\u201d went on the lady, looking full at him, \u201cthat you do not cross my threshold. I do not intend to receive you today. You may send your daughter Vera at once, if you like. I am much pleased with her.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell him about them?\u201d said Vera impatiently to her father. \u201cThey will come in, whether you announce them or not, and they are beginning to make a row. Lef Nicolaievitch,\u201d--she addressed herself to the prince--\u201cfour men are here asking for you. They have waited some time, and are beginning to make a fuss, and papa will not bring them in.\u201d \u201cWho are these people?\u201d said the prince. \u201cThey say that they have come on business, and they are the kind of men, who, if you do not see them here, will follow you about the street. It would be better to receive them, and then you will get rid of them."], "Where has Myshkin spent the years prior to returning to Russia and why?": [" He went mad and died shortly after in the town hospital. His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little girls--two of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,--were adopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness of his heart. They were brought up together with the children of his German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them left--Nastasia Philipovna--for the other little one died of whooping-cough. Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon forgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia, it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiff\u2019s house, he was not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and bright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality--as to which last Totski was an undoubted authority.", " What a lot of money he spent over me! And he tried to find me an honest husband first, and then this Gania, here. And what do you think? All these five years I did not live with him, and yet I took his money, and considered I was quite justified. \u201cYou say, take the hundred thousand and kick that man out. It is true, it is an abominable business, as you say. I might have married long ago, not Gania--Oh, no!--but that would have been abominable too. \u201cWould you believe it, I had some thoughts of marrying Totski, four years ago! I meant mischief, I confess--but I could have had him, I give you my word; he asked me himself. But I thought, no! it\u2019s not worthwhile to take such advantage of him. No! I had better go on to the streets, or accept Rogojin, or become a washerwoman or something--for I have nothing of my own, you know. I shall go away and leave everything behind, to the last rag--he shall have it all back.", " His friend, Lebedeff\u2019s nephew, who had risen to accompany him, also sat down again. He seemed much disappointed, though as self-confident as ever. Hippolyte looked dejected and sulky, as well as surprised. He had just been attacked by a violent fit of coughing, so that his handkerchief was stained with blood. The boxer looked thoroughly frightened. \u201cOh, Antip!\u201d cried he in a miserable voice, \u201cI did say to you the other day--the day before yesterday--that perhaps you were not really Pavlicheff\u2019s son!\u201d There were sounds of half-smothered laughter at this. \u201cNow, that is a valuable piece of information, Mr. Keller,\u201d replied Gania. \u201cHowever that may be, I have private information which convinces me that Mr. Burdovsky, though doubtless aware of the date of his birth, knew nothing at all about Pavlicheff\u2019s sojourn abroad. Indeed, he passed the greater part of his life out of Russia, returning at intervals for short visits.", " Even her death did not much diminish the hardships of the young man\u2019s struggle for existence. Now this is the question: how, in the name of justice, should our scion have argued the case? Our readers will think, no doubt, that he would say to himself: \u2018P---- showered benefits upon me all my life; he spent tens of thousands of roubles to educate me, to provide me with governesses, and to keep me under treatment in Switzerland. Now I am a millionaire, and P----\u2019s son, a noble young man who is not responsible for the faults of his careless and forgetful father, is wearing himself out giving ill-paid lessons. According to justice, all that was done for me ought to have been done for him. The enormous sums spent upon me were not really mine; they came to me by an error of blind Fortune, when they ought to have gone to P----\u2019s son. They should have gone to benefit him, not me, in whom P---- interested himself by a mere caprice, instead of doing his duty as a father."], "Who was Prince Myshkin's benefactor and guardian?": [" And who would take me without anything? Ask Gania, there, whether he would. Why, even Ferdishenko wouldn\u2019t have me!\u201d \u201cNo, Ferdishenko would not; he is a candid fellow, Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d said that worthy. \u201cBut the prince would. You sit here making complaints, but just look at the prince. I\u2019ve been observing him for a long while.\u201d Nastasia Philipovna looked keenly round at the prince. \u201cIs that true?\u201d she asked. \u201cQuite true,\u201d whispered the prince. \u201cYou\u2019ll take me as I am, with nothing?\u201d \u201cI will, Nastasia Philipovna.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s a pretty business!\u201d cried the general. \u201cHowever, it might have been expected of him.\u201d The prince continued to regard Nastasia with a sorrowful, but intent and piercing, gaze. \u201cHere\u2019s another alternative for me,\u201d said Nastasia, turning once more to the actress; \u201cand he does it out of pure kindness of heart. I know him. I\u2019ve found a benefactor. Perhaps, though, what they say about him may be true--that he\u2019s an--we know what.", " \u201cIf you wished to preserve your good name, why did you not give up your--your \u2018guardian,\u2019 Totski, without all that theatrical posturing?\u201d said Aglaya, suddenly a propos of nothing. \u201cWhat do you know of my position, that you dare to judge me?\u201d cried Nastasia, quivering with rage, and growing terribly white. \u201cI know this much, that you did not go out to honest work, but went away with a rich man, Rogojin, in order to pose as a fallen angel. I don\u2019t wonder that Totski was nearly driven to suicide by such a fallen angel.\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cYou are about as fit to understand me as the housemaid here, who bore witness against her lover in court the other day. She would understand me better than you do.\u201d \u201cProbably an honest girl living by her own toil. Why do you speak of a housemaid so contemptuously?\u201d \u201cI do not despise toil; I despise you when you speak of toil.\u201d \u201cIf you had cared to be an honest woman, you would have gone out as a laundress.\u201d Both had risen, and were gazing at one another with pallid faces.", " \u201cYour ideas are, of course, most praiseworthy, and in the highest degree patriotic; but you exaggerate the matter terribly. It would be better if we dropped the subject.\u201d \u201cNo, sir, I do not exaggerate, I understate the matter, if anything, undoubtedly understate it; simply because I cannot express myself as I should like, but--\u201d \u201cAllow me!\u201d The prince was silent. He sat straight up in his chair and gazed fervently at Ivan Petrovitch. \u201cIt seems to me that you have been too painfully impressed by the news of what happened to your good benefactor,\u201d said the old dignitary, kindly, and with the utmost calmness of demeanour. \u201cYou are excitable, perhaps as the result of your solitary life. If you would make up your mind to live more among your fellows in society, I trust, I am sure, that the world would be glad to welcome you, as a remarkable young man; and you would soon find yourself able to look at things more calmly.", " But now, _now_, when my sentence is out and my days numbered! How can morality have need of my last breaths, and why should I die listening to the consolations offered by the prince, who, without doubt, would not omit to demonstrate that death is actually a benefactor to me? (Christians like him always end up with that--it is their pet theory.) And what do they want with their ridiculous \u2018Pavlofsk trees\u2019? To sweeten my last hours? Cannot they understand that the more I forget myself, the more I let myself become attached to these last illusions of life and love, by means of which they try to hide from me Meyer\u2019s wall, and all that is so plainly written on it--the more unhappy they make me? What is the use of all your nature to me--all your parks and trees, your sunsets and sunrises, your blue skies and your self-satisfied faces--when all this wealth of beauty and happiness begins with the fact that it accounts me--only me--one too many!"], "Why does Prince Myshkin immediately proceed to the Yepanchins upon arrival to St. Petersburg?": [" This was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Gania\u2019s new green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in order to impress her. He was very deeply mortified. II.

Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s birthday party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this story, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in order to see after some business connected with the receipt of his unexpected fortune. It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little information. The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about him all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last. Of course the Epanchin family was much interested in his movements, though he had not had time to bid them farewell before his departure.", " \u201cObserve,\u201d he gasped, through his coughing, \u201cwhat a fellow Gania is! He talks about Nastasia\u2019s \u2018leavings,\u2019 but what does he want to take himself?\u201d The prince sat silent for a long while. His mind was filled with dread and horror. \u201cYou spoke of a meeting with Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d he said at last, in a low voice. \u201cOh--come! Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today between Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent for on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg? It has been brought about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and Nastasia is at this moment with Rogojin, not far from here--at Dana Alexeyevna\u2019s--that curious friend of hers; and to this questionable house Aglaya Ivanovna is to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia Philipovna, and for the settlement of several problems. They are going to play at arithmetic--didn\u2019t you know about it?", " Within a fortnight Totski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer, staying two and three months at a time. So passed four years peacefully and happily, in charming surroundings. At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski\u2019s last visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report reached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St. Petersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only partially true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition; but a great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly displayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in thought, she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg, straight to Totski\u2019s house, all alone. The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure; but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone."], "Who is Marie?": [" Marie was standing at the coffin\u2019s head, in all her rags, crying. \u201cA crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry. The parson, a young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher, began his sermon and pointed to Marie. \u2018There,\u2019 he said, \u2018there is the cause of the death of this venerable woman\u2019--(which was a lie, because she had been ill for at least two years)--\u2018there she stands before you, and dares not lift her eyes from the ground, because she knows that the finger of God is upon her. Look at her tatters and rags--the badge of those who lose their virtue. Who is she? her daughter!\u2019 and so on to the end. \u201cAnd just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them, nearly. Only the children had altered--for then they were all on my side and had learned to love Marie. \u201cThis is how it was: I had wished to do something for Marie; I longed to give her some money, but I never had a farthing while I was there.", " Just at this moment the whole troop of children saw us. (I found out afterwards that they had long kept a watch upon me.) They all began whistling and clapping their hands, and laughing at us. Marie ran away at once; and when I tried to talk to them, they threw stones at me. All the village heard of it the same day, and Marie\u2019s position became worse than ever. The children would not let her pass now in the streets, but annoyed her and threw dirt at her more than before. They used to run after her--she racing away with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping, and they pelting her and shouting abuse at her. \u201cOnce I had to interfere by force; and after that I took to speaking to them every day and whenever I could. Occasionally they stopped and listened; but they teased Marie all the same. \u201cI told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while they stopped their abuse of her, and let her go by silently.", " \u201cMarie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole while; she coughed dreadfully. The old women would not let the children stay in the room; but they all collected outside the window each morning, if only for a moment, and shouted \u2018_Bon jour, notre bonne Marie!_\u2019 and Marie no sooner caught sight of, or heard them, and she became quite animated at once, and, in spite of the old women, would try to sit up and nod her head and smile at them, and thank them. The little ones used to bring her nice things and sweets to eat, but she could hardly touch anything. Thanks to them, I assure you, the girl died almost perfectly happy. She almost forgot her misery, and seemed to accept their love as a sort of symbol of pardon for her offence, though she never ceased to consider herself a dreadful sinner. They used to flutter at her window just like little birds, calling out: \u2018_Nous t\u2019aimons, Marie!_\u2019 \u201cShe died very soon; I had thought she would live much longer.", " Later, when everyone--even Schneider--was angry with me for hiding nothing from the children, I pointed out how foolish it was, for they always knew things, only they learnt them in a way that soiled their minds but not so from me. One has only to remember one\u2019s own childhood to admit the truth of this. But nobody was convinced... It was two weeks before her mother died that I had kissed Marie; and when the clergyman preached that sermon the children were all on my side. \u201cWhen I told them what a shame it was of the parson to talk as he had done, and explained my reason, they were so angry that some of them went and broke his windows with stones. Of course I stopped them, for that was not right, but all the village heard of it, and how I caught it for spoiling the children! Everyone discovered now that the little ones had taken to being fond of Marie, and their parents were terribly alarmed; but Marie was so happy."], "What does General Yepanchin give Nastassya Filippovna as a birthday present and why?": [" At all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia\u2019s birthday, and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. The day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation. Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband\u2019s infidelities, had heard of the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest. The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand explanation must shortly take place--which fact alarmed him much. This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family. Before the prince\u2019s arrival he had made up his mind to plead business, and \u201ccut\u201d the meal; which simply meant running away. He was particularly anxious that this one day should be passed--especially the evening--without unpleasantness between himself and his family; and just at the right moment the prince turned up--\u201cas though Heaven had sent him on purpose,\u201d said the general to himself, as he left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom.", " All this he found out afterwards; at the moment he did not notice anything, very particularly. \u201cDo you know I am specially glad that today is your birthday!\u201d cried Hippolyte. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll soon see. D\u2019you know I had a feeling that there would be a lot of people here tonight? It\u2019s not the first time that my presentiments have been fulfilled. I wish I had known it was your birthday, I\u2019d have brought you a present--perhaps I have got a present for you! Who knows? Ha, ha! How long is it now before daylight?\u201d \u201cNot a couple of hours,\u201d said Ptitsin, looking at his watch. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of daylight now? One can read all night in the open air without it,\u201d said someone. \u201cThe good of it! Well, I want just to see a ray of the sun,\u201d said Hippolyte. \u201cCan one drink to the sun\u2019s health, do you think, prince?\u201d \u201cOh, I dare say one can; but you had better be calm and lie down, Hippolyte--that\u2019s much more important.\u201d \u201cYou are always preaching about resting; you are a regular nurse to me, prince.", " I don\u2019t know whether she meant it for a hint that I had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,\u201d added Gania, with an unpleasant smile. \u201cOh, nonsense, nonsense,\u201d said the general, with decision. \u201cWhat extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; that\u2019s not her way at all. Besides, what could _you_ give her, without having thousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait, however. Has she ever asked you for it?\u201d \u201cNo, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you haven\u2019t forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of those specially invited, you know.\u201d \u201cOh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I should think so! She\u2019s twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must be ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no.", " All the guests were known to the prince; but the curious part of the matter was that they had all arrived on the same evening, as though with one accord, although he had only himself recollected the fact that it was his birthday a few moments since. \u201cYou must have told somebody you were going to trot out the champagne, and that\u2019s why they are all come!\u201d muttered Rogojin, as the two entered the verandah. \u201cWe know all about that! You\u2019ve only to whistle and they come up in shoals!\u201d he continued, almost angrily. He was doubtless thinking of his own late experiences with his boon companions. All surrounded the prince with exclamations of welcome, and, on hearing that it was his birthday, with cries of congratulation and delight; many of them were very noisy. The presence of certain of those in the room surprised the prince vastly, but the guest whose advent filled him with the greatest wonder--almost amounting to alarm--was Evgenie Pavlovitch."], "Why is General Yepanchin glad that Myshkin can join his family for lunch?": [" It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but having a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all times, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the family was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family matters can. Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and which was nearly as good as a dinner. The young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal, at ten o\u2019clock, while still in bed. This was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. At half-past twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room, and occasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering, if he had time.", " During those three days the prince had noticed that they frequently held long conversations; he often heard their voices raised in argument on deep and learned subjects, which evidently pleased Lebedeff. He seemed as if he could not do without the general. But it was not only Ardalion Alexandrovitch whom Lebedeff kept out of the prince\u2019s way. Since they had come to the villa, he treated his own family the same. Upon the pretext that his tenant needed quiet, he kept him almost in isolation, and Muishkin protested in vain against this excess of zeal. Lebedeff stamped his feet at his daughters and drove them away if they attempted to join the prince on the terrace; not even Vera was excepted. \u201cThey will lose all respect if they are allowed to be so free and easy; besides it is not proper for them,\u201d he declared at last, in answer to a direct question from the prince. \u201cWhy on earth not?\u201d asked the latter.", " At all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia\u2019s birthday, and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience.

Isn\u2019t it so?\u201d \u201cMay be! may be so!\u201d said the prince, faintly; his heart was beating painfully. \u201cI knew you would not misunderstand me,\u201d she said, triumphantly. \u201cPrince S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and Alexandra don\u2019t understand anything about these two kinds of mind, but, just fancy, mamma does!\u201d \u201cYou are very like Lizabetha Prokofievna.\u201d \u201cWhat! surely not?\u201d said Aglaya. \u201cYes, you are, indeed.\u201d \u201cThank you; I am glad to be like mamma,\u201d she said, thoughtfully. \u201cYou respect her very much, don\u2019t you?\u201d she added, quite unconscious of the naiveness of the question. \u201c_Very_ much; and I am so glad that you have realized the fact.\u201d \u201cI am very glad, too, because she is often laughed at by people.

It\u2019s a very strict household, there!\u201d \u201cAnd you allowed it?\u201d \u201cI should think so, rather! I was not going to return and confess next day,\u201d laughed Ferdishenko, who seemed a little surprised at the disagreeable impression which his story had made on all parties. \u201cHow mean you were!\u201d said Nastasia.", " and instead of a bad action, your excellency has detailed one of your noblest deeds,\u201d said Ferdishenko. \u201cFerdishenko is \u2018done.\u2019\u201d \u201cDear me, general,\u201d said Nastasia Philipovna, absently, \u201cI really never imagined you had such a good heart.\u201d The general laughed with great satisfaction, and applied himself once more to the champagne. It was now Totski\u2019s turn, and his story was awaited with great curiosity--while all eyes turned on Nastasia Philipovna, as though anticipating that his revelation must be connected somehow with her. Nastasia, during the whole of his story, pulled at the lace trimming of her sleeve, and never once glanced at the speaker. Totski was a handsome man, rather stout, with a very polite and dignified manner. He was always well dressed, and his linen was exquisite. He had plump white hands, and wore a magnificent diamond ring on one finger. \u201cWhat simplifies the duty before me considerably, in my opinion,\u201d he began, \u201cis that I am bound to recall and relate the very worst action of my life.", " \u201cBah! you wish to hear a man tell of his worst actions, and you expect the story to come out goody-goody! One\u2019s worst actions always are mean. We shall see what the general has to say for himself now. All is not gold that glitters, you know; and because a man keeps his carriage he need not be specially virtuous, I assure you, all sorts of people keep carriages. And by what means?\u201d In a word, Ferdishenko was very angry and rapidly forgetting himself; his whole face was drawn with passion. Strange as it may appear, he had expected much better success for his story. These little errors of taste on Ferdishenko\u2019s part occurred very frequently. Nastasia trembled with rage, and looked fixedly at him, whereupon he relapsed into alarmed silence. He realized that he had gone a little too far. \u201cHad we not better end this game?\u201d asked Totski. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn, but I plead exemption,\u201d said Ptitsin. \u201cYou don\u2019t care to oblige us?\u201d asked Nastasia.", " At all events she was attracted by the idea, and gradually her guests came round to her side; the thing was original, at least, and might turn out to be amusing. \u201cAnd supposing it\u2019s something that one--one can\u2019t speak about before ladies?\u201d asked the timid and silent young man. \u201cWhy, then of course, you won\u2019t say anything about it. As if there are not plenty of sins to your score without the need of those!\u201d said Ferdishenko. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t know which of my actions is the worst,\u201d said the lively actress. \u201cLadies are exempted if they like.\u201d \u201cAnd how are you to know that one isn\u2019t lying? And if one lies the whole point of the game is lost,\u201d said Gania. \u201cOh, but think how delightful to hear how one\u2019s friends lie! Besides you needn\u2019t be afraid, Gania; everybody knows what your worst action is without the need of any lying on your part. Only think, gentlemen,\u201d--and Ferdishenko here grew quite enthusiastic, \u201conly think with what eyes we shall observe one another tomorrow, after our tales have been told!\u201d \u201cBut surely this is a joke, Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d asked Totski."], "Why does Ganya want to marry Nastassya Filippovna?": [" He seemed to have some special object in the question. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful face,\u201d said the prince, \u201cand I feel sure that her destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. Her face is smiling enough, but she must have suffered terribly--hasn\u2019t she? Her eyes show it--those two bones there, the little points under her eyes, just where the cheek begins. It\u2019s a proud face too, terribly proud! And I--I can\u2019t say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she be but good! That would make all well!\u201d \u201cAnd would you marry a woman like that, now?\u201d continued Gania, never taking his excited eyes off the prince\u2019s face. \u201cI cannot marry at all,\u201d said the latter. \u201cI am an invalid.\u201d \u201cWould Rogojin marry her, do you think?\u201d \u201cWhy not? Certainly he would, I should think. He would marry her tomorrow!--marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week!\u201d Hardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a fearful shudder that the prince almost cried out.", " They began this before you arrived here, and so I didn\u2019t show them the letter, and now they all say it, every one of them. I want to be brave, and be afraid of nobody. I don\u2019t want to go to their balls and things--I want to do good. I have long desired to run away, for I have been kept shut up for twenty years, and they are always trying to marry me off. I wanted to run away when I was fourteen years old--I was a little fool then, I know--but now I have worked it all out, and I have waited for you to tell me about foreign countries. I have never seen a single Gothic cathedral. I must go to Rome; I must see all the museums; I must study in Paris. All this last year I have been preparing and reading forbidden books. Alexandra and Adelaida are allowed to read anything they like, but I mayn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to quarrel with my sisters, but I told my parents long ago that I wish to change my social position.", " I don\u2019t wish people to laugh at me; I don\u2019t wish people to think me a \u2018little fool.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be chaffed. I felt all this of a sudden, and I refused Evgenie Pavlovitch flatly, because I am not going to be forever thrown at people\u2019s heads to be married. I want--I want--well, I\u2019ll tell you, I wish to run away from home, and I have chosen you to help me.\u201d \u201cRun away from home?\u201d cried the prince. \u201cYes--yes--yes! Run away from home!\u201d she repeated, in a transport of rage. \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t be made to blush every minute by them all! I don\u2019t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or anyone, and therefore I have chosen you. I shall tell you everything, _everything_, even the most important things of all, whenever I like, and you are to hide nothing from me on your side. I want to speak to at least one person, as I would to myself. They have suddenly begun to say that I am waiting for you, and in love with you.", " \u201cWhy does everyone, everyone worry and torment me? Why have they all been bullying me these three days about you, prince? I will not marry you--never, and under no circumstances! Know that once and for all; as if anyone could marry an absurd creature like you! Just look in the glass and see what you look like, this very moment! Why, _why_ do they torment me and say I am going to marry you? You must know it; you are in the plot with them!\u201d \u201cNo one ever tormented you on the subject,\u201d murmured Adelaida, aghast. \u201cNo one ever thought of such a thing! There has never been a word said about it!\u201d cried Alexandra. \u201cWho has been annoying her? Who has been tormenting the child? Who could have said such a thing to her? Is she raving?\u201d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, trembling with rage, to the company in general. \u201cEvery one of them has been saying it--every one of them--all these three days! And I will never, never marry him!\u201d So saying, Aglaya burst into bitter tears, and, hiding her face in her handkerchief, sank back into a chair."], "How much money does Rogozhin bring to Nastassya Filippovna's on the evening of her party?": [" He _meant_ to ask you, I know, for he said so. I suppose he thinks that as you gave him some once (you remember), you would probably refuse if he asked you again.\u201d \u201cDo you ever give him money?\u201d \u201cPrince! Money! Why I would give that man not only my money, but my very life, if he wanted it. Well, perhaps that\u2019s exaggeration; not life, we\u2019ll say, but some illness, a boil or a bad cough, or anything of that sort, I would stand with pleasure, for his sake; for I consider him a great man fallen--money, indeed!\u201d \u201cH\u2019m, then you _do_ give him money?\u201d \u201cN-no, I have never given him money, and he knows well that I will never give him any; because I am anxious to keep him out of intemperate ways. He is going to town with me now; for you must know I am off to Petersburg after Ferdishenko, while the scent is hot; I\u2019m certain he is there. I shall let the general go one way, while I go the other; we have so arranged matters in order to pop out upon Ferdishenko, you see, from different sides.", " I shall so much admire you if you put your hands into the fire for my money. All here present may be witnesses that the whole packet of money is yours if you get it out. If you don\u2019t get it out, it shall burn. I will let no one else come; away--get away, all of you--it\u2019s my money! Rogojin has bought me with it. Is it my money, Rogojin?\u201d \u201cYes, my queen; it\u2019s your own money, my joy.\u201d \u201cGet away then, all of you. I shall do as I like with my own--don\u2019t meddle! Ferdishenko, make up the fire, quick!\u201d \u201cNastasia Philipovna, I can\u2019t; my hands won\u2019t obey me,\u201d said Ferdishenko, astounded and helpless with bewilderment. \u201cNonsense,\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna, seizing the poker and raking a couple of logs together. No sooner did a tongue of flame burst out than she threw the packet of notes upon it. Everyone gasped; some even crossed themselves. \u201cShe\u2019s mad--she\u2019s mad!\u201d was the cry. \u201cOughtn\u2019t-oughtn\u2019t we to secure her?\u201d asked the general of Ptitsin, in a whisper; \u201cor shall we send for the authorities?", " \u201cWell, bring them, with or without respect, provided always you do not drop them on the way; but on the condition,\u201d went on the lady, looking full at him, \u201cthat you do not cross my threshold. I do not intend to receive you today. You may send your daughter Vera at once, if you like. I am much pleased with her.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell him about them?\u201d said Vera impatiently to her father. \u201cThey will come in, whether you announce them or not, and they are beginning to make a row. Lef Nicolaievitch,\u201d--she addressed herself to the prince--\u201cfour men are here asking for you. They have waited some time, and are beginning to make a fuss, and papa will not bring them in.\u201d \u201cWho are these people?\u201d said the prince. \u201cThey say that they have come on business, and they are the kind of men, who, if you do not see them here, will follow you about the street. It would be better to receive them, and then you will get rid of them.", " The company assembled at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s consisted of none but her most intimate friends, and formed a very small party in comparison with her usual gatherings on this anniversary. In the first place there were present Totski, and General Epanchin. They were both highly amiable, but both appeared to be labouring under a half-hidden feeling of anxiety as to the result of Nastasia\u2019s deliberations with regard to Gania, which result was to be made public this evening. Then, of course, there was Gania who was by no means so amiable as his elders, but stood apart, gloomy, and miserable, and silent. He had determined not to bring Varia with him; but Nastasia had not even asked after her, though no sooner had he arrived than she had reminded him of the episode between himself and the prince. The general, who had heard nothing of it before, began to listen with some interest, while Gania, drily, but with perfect candour, went through the whole history, including the fact of his apology to the prince."], "With what does Rogozhin attempt to kill the Prince?": [" Just as in the Moscow case. I could have shown you the very spot! \u201cHe is always silent, but I know well that he loves me so much that he must hate me. My wedding and yours are to be on the same day; so I have arranged with him. I have no secrets from him. I would kill him from very fright, but he will kill me first. He has just burst out laughing, and says that I am raving. He knows I am writing to you.\u201d There was much more of this delirious wandering in the letters--one of them was very long. At last the prince came out of the dark, gloomy park, in which he had wandered about for hours just as yesterday. The bright night seemed to him to be lighter than ever. \u201cIt must be quite early,\u201d he thought. (He had forgotten his watch.) There was a sound of distant music somewhere. \u201cAh,\u201d he thought, \u201cthe Vauxhall! They won\u2019t be there today, of course!\u201d At this moment he noticed that he was close to their house; he had felt that he must gravitate to this spot eventually, and, with a beating heart, he mounted the verandah steps.", " You know he is in love with Aglaya himself, now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha Prokofievna!\u201d \u201cOh! he\u2019s not dangerous there!\u201d cried Gania, laughing angrily. \u201cHowever, I believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is very likely to be in love, for he is a mere boy. But he won\u2019t write anonymous letters to the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing for him to attempt; but I dare swear the very first thing he did was to show me up to Aglaya as a base deceiver and intriguer. I confess I was fool enough to attempt something through him at first. I thought he would throw himself into my service out of revengeful feelings towards the prince, the sly little beast! But I know him better now. As for the theft, he may have heard of it from the widow in Petersburg, for if the old man committed himself to such an act, he can have done it for no other object but to give the money to her.", " But what astonishes me more than anything is the fellow\u2019s candid confession of weakness. You\u2019d better get rid of him tomorrow, in any case.\u201d \u201cDo you think he will make another attempt?\u201d \u201cOh no, not he, not now! But you have to be very careful with this sort of gentleman. Crime is too often the last resource of these petty nonentities. This young fellow is quite capable of cutting the throats of ten people, simply for a lark, as he told us in his \u2018explanation.\u2019 I assure you those confounded words of his will not let me sleep.\u201d \u201cI think you disturb yourself too much.\u201d \u201cWhat an extraordinary person you are, prince! Do you mean to say that you doubt the fact that he is capable of murdering ten men?\u201d \u201cI daren\u2019t say, one way or the other; all this is very strange--but--\u201d \u201cWell, as you like, just as you like,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, irritably. \u201cOnly you are such a plucky fellow, take care you don\u2019t get included among the ten victims!\u201d \u201cOh, he is much more likely not to kill anyone at all,\u201d said the prince, gazing thoughtfully at Evgenie.", " She continually trembled and blushed, and she sat on the very edge of the seat. The fact that the prince confirmed her idea, about Hippolyte shooting himself that she might read his confession, surprised her greatly. \u201cOf course,\u201d added the prince, \u201che wished us all to applaud his conduct--besides yourself.\u201d \u201cHow do you mean--applaud?\u201d \u201cWell--how am I to explain? He was very anxious that we should all come around him, and say we were so sorry for him, and that we loved him very much, and all that; and that we hoped he wouldn\u2019t kill himself, but remain alive. Very likely he thought more of you than the rest of us, because he mentioned you at such a moment, though perhaps he did not know himself that he had you in his mind\u2019s eye.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand you. How could he have me in view, and not be aware of it himself? And yet, I don\u2019t know--perhaps I do. Do you know I have intended to poison myself at least thirty times--ever since I was thirteen or so--and to write to my parents before I did it?"], "With what painting of Rogozhin's is Myshkin impressed?": [" I\u2019ve been two years looking out for a good subject for a picture. I\u2019ve done all I know. \u2018The North and South I know by heart,\u2019 as our poet observes. Do help me to a subject, prince.\u201d \u201cOh, but I know nothing about painting. It seems to me one only has to look, and paint what one sees.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t know _how_ to see!\u201d \u201cNonsense, what rubbish you talk!\u201d the mother struck in. \u201cNot know how to see! Open your eyes and look! If you can\u2019t see here, you won\u2019t see abroad either. Tell us what you saw yourself, prince!\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s better,\u201d said Adelaida; \u201cthe prince _learned to see_ abroad.\u201d \u201cOh, I hardly know! You see, I only went to restore my health. I don\u2019t know whether I learned to see, exactly. I was very happy, however, nearly all the time.\u201d \u201cHappy! you can be happy?\u201d cried Aglaya. \u201cThen how can you say you did not learn to see? I should think you could teach _us_ to see!\u201d \u201cOh! _do_ teach us,\u201d laughed Adelaida.", " They were evidently on quite familiar terms. In Moscow they had had many occasions of meeting; indeed, some few of those meetings were but too vividly impressed upon their memories. They had not met now, however, for three months. The deathlike pallor, and a sort of slight convulsion about the lips, had not left Rogojin\u2019s face. Though he welcomed his guest, he was still obviously much disturbed. As he invited the prince to sit down near the table, the latter happened to turn towards him, and was startled by the strange expression on his face. A painful recollection flashed into his mind. He stood for a time, looking straight at Rogojin, whose eyes seemed to blaze like fire. At last Rogojin smiled, though he still looked agitated and shaken. \u201cWhat are you staring at me like that for?\u201d he muttered. \u201cSit down.\u201d The prince took a chair. \u201cParfen,\u201d he said, \u201ctell me honestly, did you know that I was coming to Petersburg or no?\u201d \u201cOh, I supposed you were coming,\u201d the other replied, smiling sarcastically, \u201cand I was right in my supposition, you see; but how was I to know that you would come _today?_\u201d A certain strangeness and impatience in his manner impressed the prince very forcibly.", " \u201cBut how brave you are!\u201d said he. \u201cYou are laughing, and I--that man\u2019s tale impressed me so much, that I dreamt of it afterwards; yes, I dreamt of those five minutes...\u201d He looked at his listeners again with that same serious, searching expression. \u201cYou are not angry with me?\u201d he asked suddenly, and with a kind of nervous hurry, although he looked them straight in the face. \u201cWhy should we be angry?\u201d they cried. \u201cOnly because I seem to be giving you a lecture, all the time!\u201d At this they laughed heartily. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be angry with me,\u201d continued the prince. \u201cI know very well that I have seen less of life than other people, and have less knowledge of it. I must appear to speak strangely sometimes...\u201d He said the last words nervously. \u201cYou say you have been happy, and that proves you have lived, not less, but more than other people. Why make all these excuses?\u201d interrupted Aglaya in a mocking tone of voice.", " The elder sisters told me about it. Aglaya has agreed. They don\u2019t attempt to conceal it any longer; you know how mysterious and secret they have all been up to now. Adelaida\u2019s wedding is put off again, so that both can be married on one day. Isn\u2019t that delightfully romantic? Somebody ought to write a poem on it. Sit down and write an ode instead of tearing up and down like that. This evening Princess Bielokonski is to arrive; she comes just in time--they have a party tonight. He is to be presented to old Bielokonski, though I believe he knows her already; probably the engagement will be openly announced. They are only afraid that he may knock something down, or trip over something when he comes into the room. It would be just like him.\u201d Gania listened attentively, but to his sister\u2019s astonishment he was by no means so impressed by this news (which should, she thought, have been so important to him) as she had expected."], "What prevents Rogozhin from killing the Prince?": [" I don\u2019t think you would ever have been like Osterman.\u201d Hippolyte frowned gloomily. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why I draw the conclusion,\u201d explained the prince, evidently desirous of clearing up the matter a little. \u201cBecause, though I often think over the men of those times, I cannot for the life of me imagine them to be like ourselves. It really appears to me that they were of another race altogether than ourselves of today. At that time people seemed to stick so to one idea; now, they are more nervous, more sensitive, more enlightened--people of two or three ideas at once--as it were. The man of today is a broader man, so to speak--and I declare I believe that is what prevents him from being so self-contained and independent a being as his brother of those earlier days. Of course my remark was only made under this impression, and not in the least--\u201d \u201cI quite understand. You are trying to comfort me for the naiveness with which you disagreed with me--eh?", " \u201cListen, prince,\u201d said Gania, as though an idea had just struck him, \u201cI wish to ask you a great favour, and yet I really don\u2019t know--\u201d He paused again, he was trying to make up his mind to something, and was turning the matter over. The prince waited quietly. Once more Gania fixed him with intent and questioning eyes. \u201cPrince,\u201d he began again, \u201cthey are rather angry with me, in there, owing to a circumstance which I need not explain, so that I do not care to go in at present without an invitation. I particularly wish to speak to Aglaya, but I have written a few words in case I shall not have the chance of seeing her\u201d (here the prince observed a small note in his hand), \u201cand I do not know how to get my communication to her. Don\u2019t you think you could undertake to give it to her at once, but only to her, mind, and so that no one else should see you give it? It isn\u2019t much of a secret, but still--Well, will you do it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t quite like it,\u201d replied the prince.", " It was clear from Colia\u2019s face how painful it was to him to deliver the missive. The prince read it, rose, and took his hat. \u201cIt\u2019s only a couple of yards,\u201d said Colia, blushing. \u201cHe\u2019s sitting there over his bottle--and how they can give him credit, I cannot understand. Don\u2019t tell mother I brought you the note, prince; I have sworn not to do it a thousand times, but I\u2019m always so sorry for him. Don\u2019t stand on ceremony, give him some trifle, and let that end it.\u201d \u201cCome along, Colia, I want to see your father. I have an idea,\u201d said the prince. XII. Colia took the prince to a public-house in the Litaynaya, not far off. In one of the side rooms there sat at a table--looking like one of the regular guests of the establishment--Ardalion Alexandrovitch, with a bottle before him, and a newspaper on his knee. He was waiting for the prince, and no sooner did the latter appear than he began a long harangue about something or other; but so far gone was he that the prince could hardly understand a word.", " (This trip had taken place the day after that on which the prince had turned up at the Epanchins at nearly one o\u2019clock at night, thinking it was nine.) The sisters replied candidly and fully enough to their mother\u2019s impatient questions on her return. They said, in the first place, that nothing particular had happened since her departure; that the prince had been, and that Aglaya had kept him waiting a long while before she appeared--half an hour, at least; that she had then come in, and immediately asked the prince to have a game of chess; that the prince did not know the game, and Aglaya had beaten him easily; that she had been in a wonderfully merry mood, and had laughed at the prince, and chaffed him so unmercifully that one was quite sorry to see his wretched expression. She had then asked him to play cards--the game called \u201clittle fools.\u201d At this game the tables were turned completely, for the prince had shown himself a master at it."], "What poem does Aglaya recite in front of her family and the Prince in Pavlovsk?": [" Of course it\u2019s all an ideal, and in the \u2018poor knight\u2019 that spirit reached the utmost limit of asceticism. He is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical. I used not to understand him, and laughed at him, but now I love the \u2018poor knight,\u2019 and respect his actions.\u201d So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to judge whether she was joking or in earnest. \u201cPooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin; \u201cand as for you, young woman, you ought to know better. At all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it? Recite it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life. Prince, you must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort of thing! Be patient!\u201d They certainly were put out, both of them. The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could not get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the least embarrassed.", " He was puzzled, however, by the young man\u2019s plain clothes, for he had always heard of Evgenie Pavlovitch as a military man. An ironical smile played on Evgenie\u2019s lips all the while the recitation was proceeding, which showed that he, too, was probably in the secret of the \u2018poor knight\u2019 joke. But it had become quite a different matter with Aglaya. All the affectation of manner which she had displayed at the beginning disappeared as the ballad proceeded. She spoke the lines in so serious and exalted a manner, and with so much taste, that she even seemed to justify the exaggerated solemnity with which she had stepped forward. It was impossible to discern in her now anything but a deep feeling for the spirit of the poem which she had undertaken to interpret. Her eyes were aglow with inspiration, and a slight tremor of rapture passed over her lovely features once or twice. She continued to recite: \u201cOnce there came a vision glorious, Mystic, dreadful, wondrous fair; Burned itself into his spirit, And abode for ever there!", " She seemed, in fact, quite pleased. She now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the terrace, and stood in front of the prince\u2019s chair. All looked on with some surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided alarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far enough already, they thought. But Aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed the affectation and ceremony with which she was introducing her recitation of the poem. Mrs. Epanchin was just wondering whether she would not forbid the performance after all, when, at the very moment that Aglaya commenced her declamation, two new guests, both talking loudly, entered from the street. The new arrivals were General Epanchin and a young man. Their entrance caused some slight commotion. VII. The young fellow accompanying the general was about twenty-eight, tall, and well built, with a handsome and clever face, and bright black eyes, full of fun and intelligence.", " \u201cIt\u2019s simply that there is a Russian poem,\u201d began Prince S., evidently anxious to change the conversation, \u201ca strange thing, without beginning or end, and all about a \u2018poor knight.\u2019 A month or so ago, we were all talking and laughing, and looking up a subject for one of Adelaida\u2019s pictures--you know it is the principal business of this family to find subjects for Adelaida\u2019s pictures. Well, we happened upon this \u2018poor knight.\u2019 I don\u2019t remember who thought of it first--\u201d \u201cOh! Aglaya Ivanovna did,\u201d said Colia. \u201cVery likely--I don\u2019t recollect,\u201d continued Prince S. \u201cSome of us laughed at the subject; some liked it; but she declared that, in order to make a picture of the gentleman, she must first see his face. We then began to think over all our friends\u2019 faces to see if any of them would do, and none suited us, and so the matter stood; that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t know why Nicolai Ardalionovitch has brought up the joke now."], "What detail does Aglaya change during her reading the Pushkin's poem at Lebedev's cottage?": [" Of course it\u2019s all an ideal, and in the \u2018poor knight\u2019 that spirit reached the utmost limit of asceticism. He is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical. I used not to understand him, and laughed at him, but now I love the \u2018poor knight,\u2019 and respect his actions.\u201d So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to judge whether she was joking or in earnest. \u201cPooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin; \u201cand as for you, young woman, you ought to know better. At all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it? Recite it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life. Prince, you must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort of thing! Be patient!\u201d They certainly were put out, both of them. The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could not get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the least embarrassed.", " But Evgenie Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager) both comprehended and tried his best to show that he comprehended; his smile was too mocking to leave any doubt on that point. \u201cHow beautiful that is!\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration. \u201cWhose is it?\u201d \u201cPushkin\u2019s, mama, of course! Don\u2019t disgrace us all by showing your ignorance,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cAs soon as we reach home give it to me to read.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house.\u201d \u201cThere are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying about from time immemorial,\u201d added Alexandra. \u201cSend Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy, then.--Aglaya, come here--kiss me, dear, you recited beautifully! but,\u201d she added in a whisper, \u201cif you were sincere I am sorry for you. If it was a joke, I do not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do it, and in any case you would have done far better not to recite it at all.", " For whole hours at a time she ridiculed and chaffed the wretched man, and made him almost a laughing-stock. It is true that they used to sit in the little summer-house together for an hour or two at a time, very often, but it was observed that on these occasions the prince would read the paper, or some book, aloud to Aglaya. \u201cDo you know,\u201d Aglaya said to him once, interrupting the reading, \u201cI\u2019ve remarked that you are dreadfully badly educated. You never know anything thoroughly, if one asks you; neither anyone\u2019s name, nor dates, nor about treaties and so on. It\u2019s a great pity, you know!\u201d \u201cI told you I had not had much of an education,\u201d replied the prince. \u201cHow am I to respect you, if that\u2019s the case? Read on now. No--don\u2019t! Stop reading!\u201d And once more, that same evening, Aglaya mystified them all. Prince S. had returned, and Aglaya was particularly amiable to him, and asked a great deal after Evgenie Pavlovitch.", " I am nearly twenty-seven years old, and yet I know I am little better than a child. I have no right to express my ideas, and said so long ago. Only in Moscow, with Rogojin, did I ever speak absolutely freely! He and I read Pushkin together--all his works. Rogojin knew nothing of Pushkin, had not even heard his name. I am always afraid of spoiling a great Thought or Idea by my absurd manner. I have no eloquence, I know. I always make the wrong gestures--inappropriate gestures--and therefore I degrade the Thought, and raise a laugh instead of doing my subject justice. I have no sense of proportion either, and that is the chief thing. I know it would be much better if I were always to sit still and say nothing. When I do so, I appear to be quite a sensible sort of a person, and what\u2019s more, I think about things. But now I must speak; it is better that I should. I began to speak because you looked so kindly at me; you have such a beautiful face."], "How does Ganya prove that Burdovsky cannot possibly be Pavlishchev's son?": [" I insist on this point in order to justify him; I repeat that his simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot stand alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this matter. But I feel certain that he does not understand it! I was just the same myself before I went to Switzerland; I stammered incoherently; one tries to express oneself and cannot. I understand that. I am all the better able to pity Mr. Burdovsky, because I know from experience what it is to be like that, and so I have a right to speak. Well, though there is no such person as \u2018Pavlicheff\u2019s son,\u2019 and it is all nothing but a humbug, yet I will keep to my decision, and I am prepared to give up ten thousand roubles in memory of Pavlicheff. Before Mr. Burdovsky made this claim, I proposed to found a school with this money, in memory of my benefactor, but I shall honour his memory quite as well by giving the ten thousand roubles to Mr. Burdovsky, because, though he was not Pavlicheff\u2019s son, he was treated almost as though he were.", " \u201cHere is Burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his mother; is not that so? And he himself is the cause of her disgrace. The prince is anxious to help Burdovsky and offers him friendship and a large sum of money, in the sincerity of his heart. And here they stand like two sworn enemies--ha, ha, ha! You all hate Burdovsky because his behaviour with regard to his mother is shocking and repugnant to you; do you not? Is not that true? Is it not true? You all have a passion for beauty and distinction in outward forms; that is all you care for, isn\u2019t it? I have suspected for a long time that you cared for nothing else! Well, let me tell you that perhaps there is not one of you who loved your mother as Burdovsky loved his. As to you, prince, I know that you have sent money secretly to Burdovsky\u2019s mother through Gania. Well, I bet now,\u201d he continued with an hysterical laugh, \u201cthat Burdovsky will accuse you of indelicacy, and reproach you with a want of respect for his mother!", " As to his kind heart and his good actions, you were right indeed when you said that I was almost an idiot at that time, and could hardly understand anything--(I could speak and understand Russian, though),--but now I can appreciate what I remember--\u201d \u201cExcuse me,\u201d interrupted Hippolyte, \u201cis not this rather sentimental? You said you wished to come to the point; please remember that it is after nine o\u2019clock.\u201d \u201cVery well, gentlemen--very well,\u201d replied the prince. \u201cAt first I received the news with mistrust, then I said to myself that I might be mistaken, and that Pavlicheff might possibly have had a son. But I was absolutely amazed at the readiness with which the son had revealed the secret of his birth at the expense of his mother\u2019s honour. For Tchebaroff had already menaced me with publicity in our interview....\u201d \u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d Lebedeff\u2019s nephew interrupted violently. \u201cYou have no right--you have no right!\u201d cried Burdovsky.", " \u201cThe son is not responsible for the misdeeds of his father; and the mother is not to blame,\u201d added Hippolyte, with warmth. \u201cThat seems to me all the more reason for sparing her,\u201d said the prince timidly. \u201cPrince, you are not only simple, but your simplicity is almost past the limit,\u201d said Lebedeff\u2019s nephew, with a sarcastic smile. \u201cBut what right had you?\u201d said Hippolyte in a very strange tone. \u201cNone--none whatever,\u201d agreed the prince hastily. \u201cI admit you are right there, but it was involuntary, and I immediately said to myself that my personal feelings had nothing to do with it,--that if I thought it right to satisfy the demands of Mr. Burdovsky, out of respect for the memory of Pavlicheff, I ought to do so in any case, whether I esteemed Mr. Burdovsky or not. I only mentioned this, gentlemen, because it seemed so unnatural to me for a son to betray his mother\u2019s secret in such a way. In short, that is what convinced me that Tchebaroff must be a rogue, and that he had induced Mr. Burdovsky to attempt this fraud.\u201d \u201cBut this is intolerable!\u201d cried the visitors, some of them starting to their feet."], "What object outside his window in St. Petersburg does Hippolite spends so many hours staring at?": [" This was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Gania\u2019s new green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in order to impress her. He was very deeply mortified. II. It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St. Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the family had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide him.", " PART II I. Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s birthday party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this story, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in order to see after some business connected with the receipt of his unexpected fortune. It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little information. The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about him all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last. Of course the Epanchin family was much interested in his movements, though he had not had time to bid them farewell before his departure.", " Arrived in a large salon, next to the study, he went to the window and cautiously beckoned the prince up to him. \u201cWhen you rang the bell this morning I thought it must be you. I went to the door on tip-toe and heard you talking to the servant opposite. I had told her before that if anyone came and rang--especially you, and I gave her your name--she was not to tell about me. Then I thought, what if he goes and stands opposite and looks up, or waits about to watch the house? So I came to this very window, looked out, and there you were staring straight at me. That\u2019s how it came about.\u201d \u201cWhere is Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d asked the prince, breathlessly. \u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d replied Rogojin, slowly, after a slight pause. \u201cWhere?\u201d Rogojin raised his eyes and gazed intently at the prince. \u201cCome,\u201d he said. He continued to speak in a whisper, very deliberately as before, and looked strangely thoughtful and dreamy.", " He even advanced a couple of steps to meet him. The prince came forward and introduced himself. \u201cQuite so,\u201d replied the general, \u201cand what can I do for you?\u201d \u201cOh, I have no special business; my principal object was to make your acquaintance. I should not like to disturb you. I do not know your times and arrangements here, you see, but I have only just arrived. I came straight from the station. I am come direct from Switzerland.\u201d The general very nearly smiled, but thought better of it and kept his smile back. Then he reflected, blinked his eyes, stared at his guest once more from head to foot; then abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat down himself, and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak. Gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room, turning over papers. \u201cI have not much time for making acquaintances, as a rule,\u201d said the general, \u201cbut as, of course, you have your object in coming, I--\u201d \u201cI felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved to pay you this visit,\u201d the prince interrupted; \u201cbut I give you my word, beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal object whatever.\u201d \u201cThe pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as you are aware."], "Why does Hippolite's suicide attempt fail?": [" You know he is in love with Aglaya himself, now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha Prokofievna!\u201d \u201cOh! he\u2019s not dangerous there!\u201d cried Gania, laughing angrily. \u201cHowever, I believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is very likely to be in love, for he is a mere boy. But he won\u2019t write anonymous letters to the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing for him to attempt; but I dare swear the very first thing he did was to show me up to Aglaya as a base deceiver and intriguer. I confess I was fool enough to attempt something through him at first. I thought he would throw himself into my service out of revengeful feelings towards the prince, the sly little beast! But I know him better now. As for the theft, he may have heard of it from the widow in Petersburg, for if the old man committed himself to such an act, he can have done it for no other object but to give the money to her.", " Was there no one else here? I thought there was another woman.\u201d \u201cThere was another woman here?\u201d At last he was wide awake. \u201cIt was a dream, of course,\u201d he said, musingly. \u201cStrange that I should have a dream like that at such a moment. Sit down--\u201d He took her hand and seated her on the bench; then sat down beside her and reflected. Aglaya did not begin the conversation, but contented herself with watching her companion intently. He looked back at her, but at times it was clear that he did not see her and was not thinking of her. Aglaya began to flush up. \u201cOh yes!\u201d cried the prince, starting. \u201cHippolyte\u2019s suicide--\u201d \u201cWhat? At your house?\u201d she asked, but without much surprise. \u201cHe was alive yesterday evening, wasn\u2019t he? How could you sleep here after that?\u201d she cried, growing suddenly animated. \u201cOh, but he didn\u2019t kill himself; the pistol didn\u2019t go off.\u201d Aglaya insisted on hearing the whole story.", " She hurried the prince along, but interrupted him with all sorts of questions, nearly all of which were irrelevant. Among other things, she seemed greatly interested in every word that Evgenie Pavlovitch had said, and made the prince repeat that part of the story over and over again. \u201cWell, that\u2019ll do; we must be quick,\u201d she concluded, after hearing all. \u201cWe have only an hour here, till eight; I must be home by then without fail, so that they may not find out that I came and sat here with you; but I\u2019ve come on business. I have a great deal to say to you. But you have bowled me over considerably with your news. As to Hippolyte, I think his pistol was bound not to go off; it was more consistent with the whole affair. Are you sure he really wished to blow his brains out, and that there was no humbug about the matter?\u201d \u201cNo humbug at all.\u201d \u201cVery likely. So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his confession, did he?", " He insisted that the prince had nothing whatever to do with Nastasia Philipovna, so far as any liaison was concerned; and, if the truth were to be told about it, he added, never had had. Meanwhile nothing put the prince out, and he continued to be in the seventh heaven of bliss. Of course he could not fail to observe some impatience and ill-temper in Aglaya now and then; but he believed in something else, and nothing could now shake his conviction. Besides, Aglaya\u2019s frowns never lasted long; they disappeared of themselves. Perhaps he was too easy in his mind. So thought Hippolyte, at all events, who met him in the park one day. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you the truth now, when I said you were in love?\u201d he said, coming up to Muishkin of his own accord, and stopping him. The prince gave him his hand and congratulated him upon \u201clooking so well.\u201d Hippolyte himself seemed to be hopeful about his state of health, as is often the case with consumptives."], "Why does Nastassya Filippovna speak on such friendly terms with Yevgeny Radomsky?": [" Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing, announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined tastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty. Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated. Might he suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the general\u2019s daughters? Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the Epanchins was about to undergo a change.", " \u201cThen at all events he knows her!\u201d remarked the prince, after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cOh, that may be. He may have known her some time ago--two or three years, at least. He used to know Totski. But it is impossible that there should be any intimacy between them. She has not even been in the place--many people don\u2019t even know that she has returned from Moscow! I have only observed her carriage about for the last three days or so.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely carriage,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cYes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!\u201d The visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than before. But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince, from his own point of view. Admitting that he had his suspicions, from the moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that Nastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his suspicions and justified his fears.", " Three months after the departure of the prince, the Ivolgin family discovered that Colia had made acquaintance with the Epanchins, and was on very friendly terms with the daughters. Varia heard of it first, though Colia had not asked her to introduce him. Little by little the family grew quite fond of him. Madame Epanchin at first looked on him with disdain, and received him coldly, but in a short time he grew to please her, because, as she said, he \u201cwas candid and no flatterer\u201d--a very true description. From the first he put himself on an equality with his new friends, and though he sometimes read newspapers and books to the mistress of the house, it was simply because he liked to be useful. One day, however, he and Lizabetha Prokofievna quarrelled seriously about the \u201cwoman question,\u201d in the course of a lively discussion on that burning subject. He told her that she was a tyrant, and that he would never set foot in her house again.", " This fact was that Gania had come home that night, but had refused to go to bed. He had awaited the prince\u2019s return from Ekaterinhof with feverish impatience. On the latter\u2019s arrival, at six in the morning, Gania had gone to him in his room, bringing with him the singed packet of money, which he had insisted that the prince should return to Nastasia Philipovna without delay. It was said that when Gania entered the prince\u2019s room, he came with anything but friendly feelings, and in a condition of despair and misery; but that after a short conversation, he had stayed on for a couple of hours with him, sobbing continuously and bitterly the whole time. They had parted upon terms of cordial friendship. The Epanchins heard about this, as well as about the episode at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s. It was strange, perhaps, that the facts should become so quickly, and fairly accurately, known. As far as Gania was concerned, it might have been supposed that the news had come through Varvara Ardalionovna, who had suddenly become a frequent visitor of the Epanchin girls, greatly to their mother\u2019s surprise."], "Where and at what time does Aglaya arrange the meeting with the Prince?": [" Gania evidently could not make head nor tail of the matter, and turned as red as a lobster; but Varia understood at once that they must get away as quickly as they could, so she dragged Gania away; she is a great deal cleverer than he is. As for myself, I went there to arrange a meeting to be held between Aglaya Ivanovna and Nastasia Philipovna.\u201d \u201cNastasia Philipovna!\u201d cried the prince. \u201cAha! I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m glad that you are not above ordinary human feelings, for once. I\u2019ll console you a little now, after your consternation. See what I get for serving a young and high-souled maiden! This morning I received a slap in the face from the lady!\u201d \u201cA--a moral one?\u201d asked the prince, involuntarily. \u201cYes--not a physical one! I don\u2019t suppose anyone--even a woman--would raise a hand against me now. Even Gania would hesitate!", " I am very unfortunate today in my expressions.\u201d \u201cI knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch--\u201d began the prince, and paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at his betraying no surprise. \u201cYou knew it? Come, that\u2019s news! But no--perhaps better not tell me. And were you a witness of the meeting?\u201d \u201cIf you were there yourself you must have known that I was _not_ there!\u201d \u201cOh! but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere. However, I am very glad, on your account, of course. I was beginning to be afraid that Mr. Gania--might have the preference!\u201d \u201cMay I ask you, Hippolyte, not to talk of this subject? And not to use such expressions?\u201d \u201cEspecially as you know all, eh?\u201d \u201cYou are wrong. I know scarcely anything, and Aglaya Ivanovna is aware that I know nothing. I knew nothing whatever about this meeting. You say there was a meeting. Very well; let\u2019s leave it so--\u201d \u201cWhy, what do you mean?", " \u201cObserve,\u201d he gasped, through his coughing, \u201cwhat a fellow Gania is! He talks about Nastasia\u2019s \u2018leavings,\u2019 but what does he want to take himself?\u201d The prince sat silent for a long while. His mind was filled with dread and horror. \u201cYou spoke of a meeting with Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d he said at last, in a low voice. \u201cOh--come! Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today between Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent for on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg? It has been brought about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and Nastasia is at this moment with Rogojin, not far from here--at Dana Alexeyevna\u2019s--that curious friend of hers; and to this questionable house Aglaya Ivanovna is to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia Philipovna, and for the settlement of several problems. They are going to play at arithmetic--didn\u2019t you know about it?", " The first old woman, so soon as she saw Rogojin and the prince, smiled and bowed courteously several times, in token of her gratification at their visit. \u201cMother,\u201d said Rogojin, kissing her hand, \u201chere is my great friend, Prince Muishkin; we have exchanged crosses; he was like a real brother to me at Moscow at one time, and did a great deal for me. Bless him, mother, as you would bless your own son. Wait a moment, let me arrange your hands for you.\u201d But the old lady, before Parfen had time to touch her, raised her right hand, and, with three fingers held up, devoutly made the sign of the cross three times over the prince. She then nodded her head kindly at him once more. \u201cThere, come along, Lef Nicolaievitch; that\u2019s all I brought you here for,\u201d said Rogojin. When they reached the stairs again he added: \u201cShe understood nothing of what I said to her, and did not know what I wanted her to do, and yet she blessed you; that shows she wished to do so herself."], "What does Aglaya send to Myshkin as a sign of peace?": [" Why didn\u2019t you send me a message? I would have come up and saved you this trouble.\u201d \u201cWell, well! Enough! You\u2019ve pitied me, and that\u2019s all that good manners exact. I forgot, how are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m all right; yesterday I was a little--\u201d \u201cI know, I heard; the china vase caught it! I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019ve come about something important. In the first place I had, the pleasure of seeing Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Aglaya Ivanovna enjoying a rendezvous on the green bench in the park. I was astonished to see what a fool a man can look. I remarked upon the fact to Aglaya Ivanovna when he had gone. I don\u2019t think anything ever surprises you, prince!\u201d added Hippolyte, gazing incredulously at the prince\u2019s calm demeanour. \u201cTo be astonished by nothing is a sign, they say, of a great intellect. In my opinion it would serve equally well as a sign of great foolishness. I am not hinting about you; pardon me!", " To the amazement of the prince, who overheard the remark, Aglaya looked haughtily and inquiringly at the questioner, as though she would give him to know, once for all, that there could be no talk between them about the \u2018poor knight,\u2019 and that she did not understand his question. \u201cBut not now! It is too late to send to town for a Pushkin now. It is much too late, I say!\u201d Colia was exclaiming in a loud voice. \u201cI have told you so at least a hundred times.\u201d \u201cYes, it is really much too late to send to town now,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, who had escaped from Aglaya as rapidly as possible. \u201cI am sure the shops are shut in Petersburg; it is past eight o\u2019clock,\u201d he added, looking at his watch. \u201cWe have done without him so far,\u201d interrupted Adelaida in her turn. \u201cSurely we can wait until to-morrow.\u201d \u201cBesides,\u201d said Colia, \u201cit is quite unusual, almost improper, for people in our position to take any interest in literature.", " Life need not consist only of lunches, and dinners, and Prince S\u2019s. It strikes me you take Aglaya Ivanovna for some conventional boarding-school girl. I said so to her, and she quite agreed with me. Wait till seven or eight o\u2019clock. In your place I would send someone there to keep watch, so as to seize the exact moment when she steps out of the house. Send Colia. He\u2019ll play the spy with pleasure--for you at least. Ha, ha, ha!\u201d Hippolyte went out. There was no reason for the prince to set anyone to watch, even if he had been capable of such a thing. Aglaya\u2019s command that he should stay at home all day seemed almost explained now. Perhaps she meant to call for him, herself, or it might be, of course, that she was anxious to make sure of his not coming there, and therefore bade him remain at home. His head whirled; the whole room seemed to be turning round. He lay down on the sofa, and closed his eyes.", " Burdovsky turned quickly, and drawing an addressed but unsealed envelope from his pocket, he threw it down on a little table beside the prince. \u201cThere\u2019s the money!... How dare you?... The money!\u201d \u201cThose are the two hundred and fifty roubles you dared to send him as a charity, by the hands of Tchebaroff,\u201d explained Doktorenko. \u201cThe article in the newspaper put it at fifty!\u201d cried Colia. \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said the prince, going up to Burdovsky. \u201cI have done you a great wrong, but I did not send you that money as a charity, believe me. And now I am again to blame. I offended you just now.\u201d (The prince was much distressed; he seemed worn out with fatigue, and spoke almost incoherently.) \u201cI spoke of swindling... but I did not apply that to you. I was deceived .... I said you were... afflicted... like me... But you are not like me... you give lessons... you support your mother. I said you had dishonoured your mother, but you love her."], "What does Prince Myshkin break at the dinner party at the Yepanchins'?": [" But how about the prince, now--look how he is blushing!\u201d \u201cI think you are partially right, but you exaggerate,\u201d said the prince, who had certainly blushed up, of a sudden, for some reason or other. \u201cFerdishenko--either tell us your story, or be quiet, and mind your own business. You exhaust all patience,\u201d cuttingly and irritably remarked Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cImmediately, immediately! As for my story, gentlemen, it is too stupid and absurd to tell you. \u201cI assure you I am not a thief, and yet I have stolen; I cannot explain why. It was at Semeon Ivanovitch Ishenka\u2019s country house, one Sunday. He had a dinner party. After dinner the men stayed at the table over their wine. It struck me to ask the daughter of the house to play something on the piano; so I passed through the corner room to join the ladies. In that room, on Maria Ivanovna\u2019s writing-table, I observed a three-rouble note. She must have taken it out for some purpose, and left it lying there.", " \u201cAnd sure enough the matter ended as satisfactorily as possible. A month or so later my medical friend was appointed to another post. He got his travelling expenses paid, and something to help him to start life with once more. I think Bachmatoff must have persuaded the doctor to accept a loan from himself. I saw Bachmatoff two or three times, about this period, the third time being when he gave a farewell dinner to the doctor and his wife before their departure, a champagne dinner. \u201cBachmatoff saw me home after the dinner and we crossed the Nicolai bridge. We were both a little drunk. He told me of his joy, the joyful feeling of having done a good action; he said that it was all thanks to myself that he could feel this satisfaction; and held forth about the foolishness of the theory that individual charity is useless. \u201cI, too, was burning to have my say! \u201c\u2018In Moscow,\u2019 I said, \u2018there was an old state counsellor, a civil general, who, all his life, had been in the habit of visiting the prisons and speaking to criminals.", " \u201cWell, you\u2019ve put me into such a fright that I shall certainly make a fool of myself, and very likely break something too. I wasn\u2019t a bit alarmed before, but now I\u2019m as nervous as can be.\u201d \u201cThen don\u2019t speak at all. Sit still and don\u2019t talk.\u201d \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do that, you know! I shall say something foolish out of pure \u2018funk,\u2019 and break something for the same excellent reason; I know I shall. Perhaps I shall slip and fall on the slippery floor; I\u2019ve done that before now, you know. I shall dream of it all night now. Why did you say anything about it?\u201d Aglaya looked blackly at him. \u201cDo you know what, I had better not come at all tomorrow! I\u2019ll plead sick-list and stay away,\u201d said the prince, with decision. Aglaya stamped her foot, and grew quite pale with anger. \u201cOh, my goodness! Just listen to that! \u2018Better not come,\u2019 when the party is on purpose for him! Good Lord! What a delightful thing it is to have to do with such a--such a stupid as you are!\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll come, I\u2019ll come,\u201d interrupted the prince, hastily, \u201cand I\u2019ll give you my word of honour that I will sit the whole evening and not say a word.\u201d \u201cI believe that\u2019s the best thing you can do.", " He could remember that Vera brought him some dinner, and that he took it; but whether he slept after dinner, or no, he could not recollect. He only knew that he began to distinguish things clearly from the moment when Aglaya suddenly appeared, and he jumped up from the sofa and went to meet her. It was just a quarter past seven then. Aglaya was quite alone, and dressed, apparently hastily, in a light mantle. Her face was pale, as it had been in the morning, and her eyes were ablaze with bright but subdued fire. He had never seen that expression in her eyes before. She gazed attentively at him. \u201cYou are quite ready, I observe,\u201d she said, with absolute composure, \u201cdressed, and your hat in your hand. I see somebody has thought fit to warn you, and I know who. Hippolyte?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me,\u201d said the prince, feeling only half alive. \u201cCome then. You know, I suppose, that you must escort me there?"], "What prompts Aglaya to run away from the meeting with Nastassya Filippovna?": [" By-the-by, look here--if someone were to challenge you to a duel, what should you do? I wished to ask you this--some time ago--\u201d \u201cWhy? Nobody would ever challenge me to a duel!\u201d \u201cBut if they were to, would you be dreadfully frightened?\u201d \u201cI dare say I should be--much alarmed!\u201d \u201cSeriously? Then are you a coward?\u201d \u201cN-no!--I don\u2019t think so. A coward is a man who is afraid and runs away; the man who is frightened but does not run away, is not quite a coward,\u201d said the prince with a smile, after a moment\u2019s thought. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t run away?\u201d \u201cNo--I don\u2019t think I should run away,\u201d replied the prince, laughing outright at last at Aglaya\u2019s questions. \u201cThough I am a woman, I should certainly not run away for anything,\u201d said Aglaya, in a slightly pained voice. \u201cHowever, I see you are laughing at me and twisting your face up as usual in order to make yourself look more interesting. Now tell me, they generally shoot at twenty paces, don\u2019t they?", " I don\u2019t wish people to laugh at me; I don\u2019t wish people to think me a \u2018little fool.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be chaffed. I felt all this of a sudden, and I refused Evgenie Pavlovitch flatly, because I am not going to be forever thrown at people\u2019s heads to be married. I want--I want--well, I\u2019ll tell you, I wish to run away from home, and I have chosen you to help me.\u201d \u201cRun away from home?\u201d cried the prince. \u201cYes--yes--yes! Run away from home!\u201d she repeated, in a transport of rage. \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t be made to blush every minute by them all! I don\u2019t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or anyone, and therefore I have chosen you. I shall tell you everything, _everything_, even the most important things of all, whenever I like, and you are to hide nothing from me on your side. I want to speak to at least one person, as I would to myself. They have suddenly begun to say that I am waiting for you, and in love with you.", " I am very unfortunate today in my expressions.\u201d \u201cI knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch--\u201d began the prince, and paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at his betraying no surprise. \u201cYou knew it? Come, that\u2019s news! But no--perhaps better not tell me. And were you a witness of the meeting?\u201d \u201cIf you were there yourself you must have known that I was _not_ there!\u201d \u201cOh! but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere. However, I am very glad, on your account, of course. I was beginning to be afraid that Mr. Gania--might have the preference!\u201d \u201cMay I ask you, Hippolyte, not to talk of this subject? And not to use such expressions?\u201d \u201cEspecially as you know all, eh?\u201d \u201cYou are wrong. I know scarcely anything, and Aglaya Ivanovna is aware that I know nothing. I knew nothing whatever about this meeting. You say there was a meeting. Very well; let\u2019s leave it so--\u201d \u201cWhy, what do you mean?", " \u201cObserve,\u201d he gasped, through his coughing, \u201cwhat a fellow Gania is! He talks about Nastasia\u2019s \u2018leavings,\u2019 but what does he want to take himself?\u201d The prince sat silent for a long while. His mind was filled with dread and horror. \u201cYou spoke of a meeting with Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d he said at last, in a low voice. \u201cOh--come! Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today between Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent for on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg? It has been brought about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and Nastasia is at this moment with Rogojin, not far from here--at Dana Alexeyevna\u2019s--that curious friend of hers; and to this questionable house Aglaya Ivanovna is to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia Philipovna, and for the settlement of several problems. They are going to play at arithmetic--didn\u2019t you know about it?"], "Where does Myshkin spend the night after following Rogozhin and Nastassya Filippovna to St. Petersburg?": [" This was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Gania\u2019s new green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in order to impress her. He was very deeply mortified. II. It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St. Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the family had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide him.", " PART II I. Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s birthday party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this story, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in order to see after some business connected with the receipt of his unexpected fortune. It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little information. The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about him all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last. Of course the Epanchin family was much interested in his movements, though he had not had time to bid them farewell before his departure.", " Lizabetha Prokofievna received confirmatory news from the princess--and alas, two months after the prince\u2019s first departure from St. Petersburg, darkness and mystery once more enveloped his whereabouts and actions, and in the Epanchin family the ice of silence once more formed over the subject. Varia, however, informed the girls of what had happened, she having received the news from Ptitsin, who generally knew more than most people. To make an end, we may say that there were many changes in the Epanchin household in the spring, so that it was not difficult to forget the prince, who sent no news of himself. The Epanchin family had at last made up their minds to spend the summer abroad, all except the general, who could not waste time in \u201ctravelling for enjoyment,\u201d of course. This arrangement was brought about by the persistence of the girls, who insisted that they were never allowed to go abroad because their parents were too anxious to marry them off.", " Within a fortnight Totski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer, staying two and three months at a time. So passed four years peacefully and happily, in charming surroundings. At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski\u2019s last visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report reached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St. Petersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only partially true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition; but a great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly displayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in thought, she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg, straight to Totski\u2019s house, all alone. The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure; but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone."], "Who visits the Prince in Switzerland?": [" \u201cThey never utter a hint about the past, not only in Aglaya\u2019s presence, but even among themselves. The old people are talking of a trip abroad in the autumn, immediately after Adelaida\u2019s wedding; Aglaya received the news in silence.\u201d Evgenie himself was very likely going abroad also; so were Prince S. and his wife, if affairs allowed of it; the general was to stay at home. They were all at their estate of Colmina now, about twenty miles or so from St. Petersburg. Princess Bielokonski had not returned to Moscow yet, and was apparently staying on for reasons of her own. Lizabetha Prokofievna had insisted that it was quite impossible to remain in Pavlofsk after what had happened. Evgenie had told her of all the rumours current in town about the affair; so that there could be no talk of their going to their house on the Yelagin as yet. \u201cAnd in point of fact, prince,\u201d added Evgenie Pavlovitch, \u201cyou must allow that they could hardly have stayed here, considering that they knew of all that went on at your place, and in the face of your daily visits to their house, visits which you insisted upon making in spite of their refusal to see you.\u201d \u201cYes--yes, quite so; you are quite right.", " Hippolyte died in great agitation, and rather sooner than he expected, about a fortnight after Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s death. Colia was much affected by these events, and drew nearer to his mother in heart and sympathy. Nina Alexandrovna is anxious, because he is \u201cthoughtful beyond his years,\u201d but he will, we think, make a useful and active man. The prince\u2019s further fate was more or less decided by Colia, who selected, out of all the persons he had met during the last six or seven months, Evgenie Pavlovitch, as friend and confidant. To him he made over all that he knew as to the events above recorded, and as to the present condition of the prince. He was not far wrong in his choice. Evgenie Pavlovitch took the deepest interest in the fate of the unfortunate \u201cidiot,\u201d and, thanks to his influence, the prince found himself once more with Dr. Schneider, in Switzerland. Evgenie Pavlovitch, who went abroad at this time, intending to live a long while on the continent, being, as he often said, quite superfluous in Russia, visits his sick friend at Schneider\u2019s every few months.", " \u201cBut how was it?\u201d he asked, \u201chow was it that you (idiot that you are),\u201d he added to himself, \u201cwere so very confidential a couple of hours after your first meeting with these people? How was that, eh?\u201d Up to this moment jealousy had not been one of his torments; now it suddenly gnawed at his heart. \u201cThat is a thing I cannot undertake to explain,\u201d replied the prince. Gania looked at him with angry contempt. \u201cOh! I suppose the present she wished to make to you, when she took you into the dining-room, was her confidence, eh?\u201d \u201cI suppose that was it; I cannot explain it otherwise.\u201d \u201cBut why, _why?_ Devil take it, what did you do in there? Why did they fancy you? Look here, can\u2019t you remember exactly what you said to them, from the very beginning? Can\u2019t you remember?\u201d \u201cOh, we talked of a great many things. When first I went in we began to speak of Switzerland.\u201d \u201cOh, the devil take Switzerland!\u201d \u201cThen about executions.\u201d \u201cExecutions?\u201d \u201cYes--at least about one.", " Hippolyte, too, was a source of some distraction to the prince at this time; he would send for him at any and every hour of the day. They lived,--Hippolyte and his mother and the children,--in a small house not far off, and the little ones were happy, if only because they were able to escape from the invalid into the garden. The prince had enough to do in keeping the peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother, and eventually the former became so malicious and sarcastic on the subject of the approaching wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last, and refused to continue his visits. A couple of days later, however, Hippolyte\u2019s mother came with tears in her eyes, and begged the prince to come back, \u201cor _he_ would eat her up bodily.\u201d She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose. Of course the prince went. There was no secret, however, unless we reckon certain pantings and agitated glances around (probably all put on) as the invalid begged his visitor to \u201cbeware of Rogojin.\u201d \u201cHe is the sort of man,\u201d he continued, \u201cwho won\u2019t give up his object, you know; he is not like you and me, prince--he belongs to quite a different order of beings."]}
