{"Whom does Myshkin meet on the train at the beginning of the novel?": [" They cannot be left out altogether, for commonplace people meet one at every turn of life, and to leave them out would be to destroy the whole reality and probability of the story. To fill a novel with typical characters only, or with merely strange and uncommon people, would render the book unreal and improbable, and would very likely destroy the interest. In my opinion, the duty of the novelist is to seek out points of interest and instruction even in the characters of commonplace people. For instance, when the whole essence of an ordinary person\u2019s nature lies in his perpetual and unchangeable commonplaceness; and when in spite of all his endeavours to do something out of the common, this person ends, eventually, by remaining in his unbroken line of routine--. I think such an individual really does become a type of his own--a type of commonplaceness which will not for the world, if it can help it, be contented, but strains and yearns to be something original and independent, without the slightest possibility of being so. To this class of commonplace people belong several characters in this novel;--characters which--I admit--I have not drawn very vividly up to now for my reader\u2019s benefit. Such were, for instance, Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin, her husband, and her brother, Gania. There is nothing so annoying as to be fairly rich, of a fairly good family, pleasing presence, average education, to be \u201cnot stupid,\u201d kind-hearted, and yet to have no talent at all, no originality, not a single idea of one\u2019s own--to be, in fact, \u201cjust like everyone else.\u201d Of such people there are countless numbers in this world--far more even than appear.", " He was very deeply mortified. II. It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St. Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the family had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide him. It must have been a hallucination. But the disagreeable impression remained, and without this, the prince was sad and thoughtful already, and seemed to be much preoccupied. His cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya. Here he engaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished. He washed and changed, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to waste no time. Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he left Petersburg would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his exterior was concerned. His clothes certainly were very different; they were more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to mockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance.", " \u201cThey will come in, whether you announce them or not, and they are beginning to make a row. Lef Nicolaievitch,\u201d--she addressed herself to the prince--\u201cfour men are here asking for you. They have waited some time, and are beginning to make a fuss, and papa will not bring them in.\u201d \u201cWho are these people?\u201d said the prince. \u201cThey say that they have come on business, and they are the kind of men, who, if you do not see them here, will follow you about the street. It would be better to receive them, and then you will get rid of them. Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Ptitsin are both there, trying to make them hear reason.\u201d \u201cPavlicheff\u2019s son! It is not worth while!\u201d cried Lebedeff. \u201cThere is no necessity to see them, and it would be most unpleasant for your excellency. They do not deserve...\u201d \u201cWhat? Pavlicheff\u2019s son!\u201d cried the prince, much perturbed. \u201cI know... I know--but I entrusted this matter to Gavrila Ardalionovitch. He told me...\u201d At that moment Gania, accompanied by Ptitsin, came out to the terrace. From an adjoining room came a noise of angry voices, and General Ivolgin, in loud tones, seemed to be trying to shout them down. Colia rushed off at once to investigate the cause of the uproar. \u201cThis is most interesting!\u201d observed Evgenie Pavlovitch. \u201cI expect he knows all about it!\u201d thought the prince. \u201cWhat, the son of Pavlicheff? And who may this son of Pavlicheff be?\u201d asked General Epanchin with surprise; and looking curiously around him, he discovered that he alone had no clue to the mystery.", " This agitated the old lady considerably; and she awoke her other daughters. Next, she learned from the maid that Aglaya had gone into the park before seven o\u2019clock. The sisters made a joke of Aglaya\u2019s last freak, and told their mother that if she went into the park to look for her, Aglaya would probably be very angry with her, and that she was pretty sure to be sitting reading on the green bench that she had talked of two or three days since, and about which she had nearly quarrelled with Prince S., who did not see anything particularly lovely in it. Arrived at the rendezvous of the prince and her daughter, and hearing the strange words of the latter, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been dreadfully alarmed, for many reasons. However, now that she had dragged the prince home with her, she began to feel a little frightened at what she had undertaken. Why should not Aglaya meet the prince in the park and have a talk with him, even if such a meeting should be by appointment? \u201cDon\u2019t suppose, prince,\u201d she began, bracing herself up for the effort, \u201cdon\u2019t suppose that I have brought you here to ask questions. After last night, I assure you, I am not so exceedingly anxious to see you at all; I could have postponed the pleasure for a long while.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut at the same time you would be very glad to know how I happened to meet Aglaya Ivanovna this morning?\u201d The prince finished her speech for her with the utmost composure."], "Where has Myshkin spent the years prior to returning to Russia and why?": [" A certain circumstance had crept in, a disagreeable and troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the whole business. This circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. Close to an estate of Totski\u2019s, in one of the central provinces of Russia, there lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest description. This gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards family and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate was mortgaged to the last acre. One day, when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor, the chief peasant of his village followed him shortly after, with the news that his house had been burnt down, and that his wife had perished with it, but his children were safe. Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could not stand this last stroke. He went mad and died shortly after in the town hospital. His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little girls--two of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,--were adopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness of his heart. They were brought up together with the children of his German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them left--Nastasia Philipovna--for the other little one died of whooping-cough. Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon forgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia, it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiff\u2019s house, he was not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and bright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality--as to which last Totski was an undoubted authority.", " It appeared that the general had known Pavlicheff; but why the latter had taken an interest in the prince, that young gentleman could not explain; probably by virtue of the old friendship with his father, he thought. The prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child, and Pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady, a relative of his own, living in the country, the child needing the fresh air and exercise of country life. He was educated, first by a governess, and afterwards by a tutor, but could not remember much about this time of his life. His fits were so frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the prince used the expression \u201cidiot\u201d himself). Pavlicheff had met Professor Schneider in Berlin, and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy to Switzerland, to Schneider\u2019s establishment there, for the cure of his epilepsy, and, five years before this time, the prince was sent off. But Pavlicheff had died two or three years since, and Schneider had himself supported the young fellow, from that day to this, at his own expense. Although he had not quite cured him, he had greatly improved his condition; and now, at last, at the prince\u2019s own desire, and because of a certain matter which came to the ears of the latter, Schneider had despatched the young man to Russia. The general was much astonished. \u201cThen you have no one, absolutely _no_ one in Russia?\u201d he asked.", " At all events, no other has ever said or written a word about it; and in this fact is expressed the whole essence of Russian liberalism of the sort which I am now considering. \u201cIn the first place, what is liberalism, speaking generally, but an attack (whether mistaken or reasonable, is quite another question) upon the existing order of things? Is this so? Yes. Very well. Then my \u2018fact\u2019 consists in this, that _Russian_ liberalism is not an attack upon the existing order of things, but an attack upon the very essence of things themselves--indeed, on the things themselves; not an attack on the Russian order of things, but on Russia itself. My Russian liberal goes so far as to reject Russia; that is, he hates and strikes his own mother. Every misfortune and mishap of the mother-country fills him with mirth, and even with ecstasy. He hates the national customs, Russian history, and everything. If he has a justification, it is that he does not know what he is doing, and believes that his hatred of Russia is the grandest and most profitable kind of liberalism. (You will often find a liberal who is applauded and esteemed by his fellows, but who is in reality the dreariest, blindest, dullest of conservatives, and is not aware of the fact.) This hatred for Russia has been mistaken by some of our \u2018Russian liberals\u2019 for sincere love of their country, and they boast that they see better than their neighbours what real love of one\u2019s country should consist in.", " You, once so refined and delicate of speech. Oh, what a tongue! What dreadful things you are saying,\u201d cried the general, wringing his hands in real grief. \u201cI am intoxicated, general. I am having a day out, you know--it\u2019s my birthday! I have long looked forward to this happy occasion. Daria Alexeyevna, you see that nosegay-man, that Monsieur aux Camelias, sitting there laughing at us?\u201d \u201cI am not laughing, Nastasia Philipovna; I am only listening with all my attention,\u201d said Totski, with dignity. \u201cWell, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free? Is he worth it? He is only just what he ought to be--nothing particular. He thinks I am to blame, too. He gave me my education, kept me like a countess. Money--my word! What a lot of money he spent over me! And he tried to find me an honest husband first, and then this Gania, here. And what do you think? All these five years I did not live with him, and yet I took his money, and considered I was quite justified. \u201cYou say, take the hundred thousand and kick that man out. It is true, it is an abominable business, as you say. I might have married long ago, not Gania--Oh, no!--but that would have been abominable too. \u201cWould you believe it, I had some thoughts of marrying Totski, four years ago! I meant mischief, I confess--but I could have had him, I give you my word; he asked me himself. But I thought, no! it\u2019s not worthwhile to take such advantage of him."], "Who was Prince Myshkin's benefactor and guardian?": [" The prince realized this, and great suffering expressed itself in his face. Aglaya observed it, and trembled with anger. \u201cHow dare you speak so to me?\u201d she said, with a haughtiness which was quite indescribable, replying to Nastasia\u2019s last remark. \u201cYou must have misunderstood what I said,\u201d said Nastasia, in some surprise. \u201cIf you wished to preserve your good name, why did you not give up your--your \u2018guardian,\u2019 Totski, without all that theatrical posturing?\u201d said Aglaya, suddenly a propos of nothing. \u201cWhat do you know of my position, that you dare to judge me?\u201d cried Nastasia, quivering with rage, and growing terribly white. \u201cI know this much, that you did not go out to honest work, but went away with a rich man, Rogojin, in order to pose as a fallen angel. I don\u2019t wonder that Totski was nearly driven to suicide by such a fallen angel.\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cYou are about as fit to understand me as the housemaid here, who bore witness against her lover in court the other day. She would understand me better than you do.\u201d \u201cProbably an honest girl living by her own toil. Why do you speak of a housemaid so contemptuously?\u201d \u201cI do not despise toil; I despise you when you speak of toil.\u201d \u201cIf you had cared to be an honest woman, you would have gone out as a laundress.\u201d Both had risen, and were gazing at one another with pallid faces. \u201cAglaya, don\u2019t! This is unfair,\u201d cried the prince, deeply distressed.", " No! I had better go on to the streets, or accept Rogojin, or become a washerwoman or something--for I have nothing of my own, you know. I shall go away and leave everything behind, to the last rag--he shall have it all back. And who would take me without anything? Ask Gania, there, whether he would. Why, even Ferdishenko wouldn\u2019t have me!\u201d \u201cNo, Ferdishenko would not; he is a candid fellow, Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d said that worthy. \u201cBut the prince would. You sit here making complaints, but just look at the prince. I\u2019ve been observing him for a long while.\u201d Nastasia Philipovna looked keenly round at the prince. \u201cIs that true?\u201d she asked. \u201cQuite true,\u201d whispered the prince. \u201cYou\u2019ll take me as I am, with nothing?\u201d \u201cI will, Nastasia Philipovna.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s a pretty business!\u201d cried the general. \u201cHowever, it might have been expected of him.\u201d The prince continued to regard Nastasia with a sorrowful, but intent and piercing, gaze. \u201cHere\u2019s another alternative for me,\u201d said Nastasia, turning once more to the actress; \u201cand he does it out of pure kindness of heart. I know him. I\u2019ve found a benefactor. Perhaps, though, what they say about him may be true--that he\u2019s an--we know what. And what shall you live on, if you are really so madly in love with Rogojin\u2019s mistress, that you are ready to marry her--eh?\u201d \u201cI take you as a good, honest woman, Nastasia Philipovna--not as Rogojin\u2019s mistress.\u201d \u201cWho?", " I may add that I discovered yet another fact, the last on which I employed my detective powers. Seeing how fond Pavlicheff was of you,--it was thanks to him you went to school, and also had the advantage of special teachers--his relations and servants grew to believe that you were his son, and that your father had been betrayed by his wife. I may point out that this idea was only accredited generally during the last years of Pavlicheff\u2019s life, when his next-of-kin were trembling about the succession, when the earlier story was quite forgotten, and when all opportunity for discovering the truth had seemingly passed away. No doubt you, Mr. Burdovsky, heard this conjecture, and did not hesitate to accept it as true. I have had the honour of making your mother\u2019s acquaintance, and I find that she knows all about these reports. What she does not know is that you, her son, should have listened to them so complaisantly. I found your respected mother at Pskoff, ill and in deep poverty, as she has been ever since the death of your benefactor. She told me with tears of gratitude how you had supported her; she expects much of you, and believes fervently in your future success...\u201d \u201cOh, this is unbearable!\u201d said Lebedeff\u2019s nephew impatiently. \u201cWhat is the good of all this romancing?\u201d \u201cIt is revolting and unseemly!\u201d cried Hippolyte, jumping up in a fury. Burdovsky alone sat silent and motionless.", " \u201cBesides, though you are a prince and a millionaire, and even though you may really be simple and good-hearted, you can hardly be outside the general law,\u201d Hippolyte declared loudly. \u201cPerhaps not; it is very possible,\u201d the prince agreed hastily, \u201cthough I do not know what general law you allude to. I will go on--only please do not take offence without good cause. I assure you I do not mean to offend you in the least. Really, it is impossible to speak three words sincerely without your flying into a rage! At first I was amazed when Tchebaroff told me that Pavlicheff had a son, and that he was in such a miserable position. Pavlicheff was my benefactor, and my father\u2019s friend. Oh, Mr. Keller, why does your article impute things to my father without the slightest foundation? He never squandered the funds of his company nor ill-treated his subordinates, I am absolutely certain of it; I cannot imagine how you could bring yourself to write such a calumny! But your assertions concerning Pavlicheff are absolutely intolerable! You do not scruple to make a libertine of that noble man; you call him a sensualist as coolly as if you were speaking the truth, and yet it would not be possible to find a chaster man. He was even a scholar of note, and in correspondence with several celebrated scientists, and spent large sums in the interests of science. As to his kind heart and his good actions, you were right indeed when you said that I was almost an idiot at that time, and could hardly understand anything--(I could speak and understand Russian, though),--but now I can appreciate what I remember--\u201d \u201cExcuse me,\u201d interrupted Hippolyte, \u201cis not this rather sentimental?"], "Why does Prince Myshkin immediately proceed to the Yepanchins upon arrival to St. Petersburg?": [" He was very deeply mortified. II. It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St. Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay.

His clothes certainly were very different; they were more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to mockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance.", " Besides, the word \u2018leavings\u2019 is not my invention. At all events, they all used it at Gania\u2019s, and she used it herself. So why am I a scandal-monger? I see--I see you are tremendously amused, at this moment! Probably you are laughing at me and fitting those silly lines to my case-- \u201c\u2018Maybe sad Love upon his setting smiles, And with vain hopes his farewell hour beguiles.\u2019 \u201cHa, ha, ha!\u201d Hippolyte suddenly burst into a fit of hysterical laughter, which turned into a choking cough. \u201cObserve,\u201d he gasped, through his coughing, \u201cwhat a fellow Gania is! He talks about Nastasia\u2019s \u2018leavings,\u2019 but what does he want to take himself?\u201d The prince sat silent for a long while. His mind was filled with dread and horror. \u201cYou spoke of a meeting with Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d he said at last, in a low voice. \u201cOh--come! Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today between Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent for on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg? It has been brought about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and Nastasia is at this moment with Rogojin, not far from here--at Dana Alexeyevna\u2019s--that curious friend of hers; and to this questionable house Aglaya Ivanovna is to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia Philipovna, and for the settlement of several problems. They are going to play at arithmetic--didn\u2019t you know about it? Word of honour?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a most improbable story.\u201d \u201cOh, very well!", " I felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have been tempted to cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was my best justification. Such a woman could make anyone forget all reason--everything! Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her a hundred thousand roubles! Of course, all that happened tonight was ephemeral, fantastic, unseemly--yet it lacked neither colour nor originality. My God! What might not have been made of such a character combined with such beauty! Yet in spite of all efforts--in spite of all education, even--all those gifts are wasted! She is an uncut diamond.... I have often said so.\u201d And Afanasy Ivanovitch heaved a deep sigh. PART II I. Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s birthday party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this story, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in order to see after some business connected with the receipt of his unexpected fortune. It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little information. The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about him all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last.", " I will not go into details. I don\u2019t ask either admission or confirmation of this from yourself; I am quite content to leave you to your conscience, and to feel that we understand one another capitally.\u201d \u201cWhat a history you are weaving out of the most ordinary circumstances!\u201d cried Varia. \u201cI told you the fellow was nothing but a scandal-monger,\u201d said Gania. \u201cExcuse me, Varia Ardalionovna, I will proceed. I can, of course, neither love nor respect the prince, though he is a good-hearted fellow, if a little queer. But there is no need whatever for me to hate him. I quite understood your brother when he first offered me aid against the prince, though I did not show it; I knew well that your brother was making a ridiculous mistake in me. I am ready to spare him, however, even now; but solely out of respect for yourself, Varvara Ardalionovna. \u201cHaving now shown you that I am not quite such a fool as I look, and that I have to be fished for with a rod and line for a good long while before I am caught, I will proceed to explain why I specially wished to make your brother look a fool. That my motive power is hate, I do not attempt to conceal. I have felt that before dying (and I am dying, however much fatter I may appear to you), I must absolutely make a fool of, at least, one of that class of men which has dogged me all my life, which I hate so cordially, and which is so prominently represented by your much esteemed brother."], "Who is Marie?": [" She stood before me, dreadfully ashamed of herself, and with downcast eyes; and when I had finished she kissed my hand. I would have kissed hers, but she drew it away. Just at this moment the whole troop of children saw us. (I found out afterwards that they had long kept a watch upon me.) They all began whistling and clapping their hands, and laughing at us. Marie ran away at once; and when I tried to talk to them, they threw stones at me. All the village heard of it the same day, and Marie\u2019s position became worse than ever. The children would not let her pass now in the streets, but annoyed her and threw dirt at her more than before. They used to run after her--she racing away with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping, and they pelting her and shouting abuse at her. \u201cOnce I had to interfere by force; and after that I took to speaking to them every day and whenever I could. Occasionally they stopped and listened; but they teased Marie all the same. \u201cI told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while they stopped their abuse of her, and let her go by silently. Little by little we got into the way of conversing together, the children and I. I concealed nothing from them, I told them all. They listened very attentively and soon began to be sorry for Marie. At last some of them took to saying \u2018Good-morning\u2019 to her, kindly, when they met her. It is the custom there to salute anyone you meet with \u2018Good-morning\u2019 whether acquainted or not.", " \u201cMarie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole while; she coughed dreadfully. The old women would not let the children stay in the room; but they all collected outside the window each morning, if only for a moment, and shouted \u2018_Bon jour, notre bonne Marie!_\u2019 and Marie no sooner caught sight of, or heard them, and she became quite animated at once, and, in spite of the old women, would try to sit up and nod her head and smile at them, and thank them. The little ones used to bring her nice things and sweets to eat, but she could hardly touch anything. Thanks to them, I assure you, the girl died almost perfectly happy. She almost forgot her misery, and seemed to accept their love as a sort of symbol of pardon for her offence, though she never ceased to consider herself a dreadful sinner. They used to flutter at her window just like little birds, calling out: \u2018_Nous t\u2019aimons, Marie!_\u2019 \u201cShe died very soon; I had thought she would live much longer. The day before her death I went to see her for the last time, just before sunset. I think she recognized me, for she pressed my hand. \u201cNext morning they came and told me that Marie was dead. The children could not be restrained now; they went and covered her coffin with flowers, and put a wreath of lovely blossoms on her head. The pastor did not throw any more shameful words at the poor dead woman; but there were very few people at the funeral.", " Everyone discovered now that the little ones had taken to being fond of Marie, and their parents were terribly alarmed; but Marie was so happy. The children were forbidden to meet her; but they used to run out of the village to the herd and take her food and things; and sometimes just ran off there and kissed her, and said, \u2018_Je vous aime, Marie!_\u2019 and then trotted back again. They imagined that I was in love with Marie, and this was the only point on which I did not undeceive them, for they got such enjoyment out of it. And what delicacy and tenderness they showed! \u201cIn the evening I used to walk to the waterfall. There was a spot there which was quite closed in and hidden from view by large trees; and to this spot the children used to come to me. They could not bear that their dear Leon should love a poor girl without shoes to her feet and dressed all in rags and tatters. So, would you believe it, they actually clubbed together, somehow, and bought her shoes and stockings, and some linen, and even a dress! I can\u2019t understand how they managed it, but they did it, all together. When I asked them about it they only laughed and shouted, and the little girls clapped their hands and kissed me. I sometimes went to see Marie secretly, too. She had become very ill, and could hardly walk. She still went with the herd, but could not help the herdsman any longer. She used to sit on a stone near, and wait there almost motionless all day, till the herd went home.", " Marie bore all this; and I could see when I got to know her that she thought it quite right and fitting, considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures. \u201cWhen the old woman took to her bed finally, the other old women in the village sat with her by turns, as the custom is there; and then Marie was quite driven out of the house. They gave her no food at all, and she could not get any work in the village; none would employ her. The men seemed to consider her no longer a woman, they said such dreadful things to her. Sometimes on Sundays, if they were drunk enough, they used to throw her a penny or two, into the mud, and Marie would silently pick up the money. She had began to spit blood at that time. \u201cAt last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of appearing in the village any longer. The children used to pelt her with mud; so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd, but the cowherd would not have her. Then she took to helping him without leave; and he saw how valuable her assistance was to him, and did not drive her away again; on the contrary, he occasionally gave her the remnants of his dinner, bread and cheese. He considered that he was being very kind. When the mother died, the village parson was not ashamed to hold Marie up to public derision and shame. Marie was standing at the coffin\u2019s head, in all her rags, crying. \u201cA crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry."], "What does General Yepanchin give Nastassya Filippovna as a birthday present and why?": [" But at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances. However, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when one day Nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on the evening of her birthday, which anniversary was due in a very short time. A strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less than that the respectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so fascinated by Nastasia Philipovna that his feeling for her amounted almost to passion. What he thought to gain by Gania\u2019s marriage to the girl it was difficult to imagine. Possibly he counted on Gania\u2019s complaisance; for Totski had long suspected that there existed some secret understanding between the general and his secretary. At all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia\u2019s birthday, and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. The day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation. Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband\u2019s infidelities, had heard of the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest. The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand explanation must shortly take place--which fact alarmed him much. This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family.", " I\u2019ve been half an hour here with him, and he--\u201d Hippolyte had been waiting for the prince all this time, and had never ceased looking at him and Evgenie Pavlovitch as they conversed in the corner. He became much excited when they approached the table once more. He was disturbed in his mind, it seemed; perspiration stood in large drops on his forehead; in his gleaming eyes it was easy to read impatience and agitation; his gaze wandered from face to face of those present, and from object to object in the room, apparently without aim. He had taken a part, and an animated one, in the noisy conversation of the company; but his animation was clearly the outcome of fever. His talk was almost incoherent; he would break off in the middle of a sentence which he had begun with great interest, and forget what he had been saying. The prince discovered to his dismay that Hippolyte had been allowed to drink two large glasses of champagne; the one now standing by him being the third. All this he found out afterwards; at the moment he did not notice anything, very particularly. \u201cDo you know I am specially glad that today is your birthday!\u201d cried Hippolyte. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll soon see. D\u2019you know I had a feeling that there would be a lot of people here tonight? It\u2019s not the first time that my presentiments have been fulfilled. I wish I had known it was your birthday, I\u2019d have brought you a present--perhaps I have got a present for you!", " \u201cHalloa! Nastasia Philipovna! Did she send it you herself? Herself?\u201d he inquired, with much curiosity and great animation. \u201cShe gave it me just now, when I called in to congratulate her. I asked her for it long ago. I don\u2019t know whether she meant it for a hint that I had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,\u201d added Gania, with an unpleasant smile. \u201cOh, nonsense, nonsense,\u201d said the general, with decision. \u201cWhat extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; that\u2019s not her way at all. Besides, what could _you_ give her, without having thousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait, however. Has she ever asked you for it?\u201d \u201cNo, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you haven\u2019t forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of those specially invited, you know.\u201d \u201cOh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I should think so! She\u2019s twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must be ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no. So be prepared!\u201d Gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than ever. \u201cAre you sure she said that?\u201d he asked, and his voice seemed to quiver as he spoke. \u201cYes, she promised. We both worried her so that she gave in; but she wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day.\u201d The general watched Gania\u2019s confusion intently, and clearly did not like it.", " At all events they were clearly enjoying themselves, and the prince observed further on closer investigation--that all had been drinking champagne. To judge from the lively condition of some of the party, it was to be supposed that a considerable quantity of champagne had been consumed already. All the guests were known to the prince; but the curious part of the matter was that they had all arrived on the same evening, as though with one accord, although he had only himself recollected the fact that it was his birthday a few moments since. \u201cYou must have told somebody you were going to trot out the champagne, and that\u2019s why they are all come!\u201d muttered Rogojin, as the two entered the verandah. \u201cWe know all about that! You\u2019ve only to whistle and they come up in shoals!\u201d he continued, almost angrily. He was doubtless thinking of his own late experiences with his boon companions. All surrounded the prince with exclamations of welcome, and, on hearing that it was his birthday, with cries of congratulation and delight; many of them were very noisy. The presence of certain of those in the room surprised the prince vastly, but the guest whose advent filled him with the greatest wonder--almost amounting to alarm--was Evgenie Pavlovitch. The prince could not believe his eyes when he beheld the latter, and could not help thinking that something was wrong. Lebedeff ran up promptly to explain the arrival of all these gentlemen."], "Why is General Yepanchin glad that Myshkin can join his family for lunch?": [" \u201cHide-and-seek? What do you mean?\u201d inquired Mrs. Epanchin. \u201cOh, do stop pretending, mamma,\u201d cried Aglaya, in vexation. \u201cSend him up, father; mother allows.\u201d The general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be shown in. \u201cOnly on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch, then,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, \u201cand let Fedor, or Mavra, stand behind him while he eats. Is he quiet when he has these fits? He doesn\u2019t show violence, does he?\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up. His manners are excellent--but here he is himself. Here you are, prince--let me introduce you, the last of the Muishkins, a relative of your own, my dear, or at least of the same name. Receive him kindly, please. They\u2019ll bring in lunch directly, prince; you must stop and have some, but you must excuse me. I\u2019m in a hurry, I must be off--\u201d \u201cWe all know where _you_ must be off to!\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, in a meaning voice. \u201cYes, yes--I must hurry away, I\u2019m late! Look here, dears, let him write you something in your albums; you\u2019ve no idea what a wonderful caligraphist he is, wonderful talent! He has just written out \u2018Abbot Pafnute signed this\u2019 for me. Well, _au revoir!_\u201d \u201cStop a minute; where are you off to? Who is this abbot?\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of excited annoyance. \u201cYes, my dear, it was an old abbot of that name--I must be off to see the count, he\u2019s waiting for me, I\u2019m late--Good-bye!", " True enough, most of the guests, next day and the day after, were not in very good humour. Ivan Petrovitch was a little offended, but not seriously so. General Epanchin\u2019s chief was rather cool towards him for some while after the occurrence. The old dignitary, as patron of the family, took the opportunity of murmuring some kind of admonition to the general, and added, in flattering terms, that he was most interested in Aglaya\u2019s future. He was a man who really did possess a kind heart, although his interest in the prince, in the earlier part of the evening, was due, among other reasons, to the latter\u2019s connection with Nastasia Philipovna, according to popular report. He had heard a good deal of this story here and there, and was greatly interested in it, so much so that he longed to ask further questions about it. Princess Bielokonski, as she drove away on this eventful evening, took occasion to say to Lizabetha Prokofievna: \u201cWell--he\u2019s a good match--and a bad one; and if you want my opinion, more bad than good. You can see for yourself the man is an invalid.\u201d Lizabetha therefore decided that the prince was impossible as a husband for Aglaya; and during the ensuing night she made a vow that never while she lived should he marry Aglaya. With this resolve firmly impressed upon her mind, she awoke next day; but during the morning, after her early lunch, she fell into a condition of remarkable inconsistency.", " But at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances.

This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family.", " All three of the Miss Epanchins were fine, healthy girls, well-grown, with good shoulders and busts, and strong--almost masculine--hands; and, of course, with all the above attributes, they enjoyed capital appetites, of which they were not in the least ashamed. Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a little too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward deference to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave, had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had been in the habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had judged it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was well aware of the fact. It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but having a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all times, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the family was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family matters can. Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and which was nearly as good as a dinner. The young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal, at ten o\u2019clock, while still in bed."], "What is Totsky's \"worst action,\" according to his story at Nastassya Filippovna's party?": [" Daria, the housemaid was suspected. I exhibited the greatest interest and sympathy, and I remember that poor Daria quite lost her head, and that I began assuring her, before everyone, that I would guarantee her forgiveness on the part of her mistress, if she would confess her guilt. They all stared at the girl, and I remember a wonderful attraction in the reflection that here was I sermonizing away, with the money in my own pocket all the while. I went and spent the three roubles that very evening at a restaurant. I went in and asked for a bottle of Lafite, and drank it up; I wanted to be rid of the money. \u201cI did not feel much remorse either then or afterwards; but I would not repeat the performance--believe it or not as you please. There--that\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cOnly, of course that\u2019s not nearly your worst action,\u201d said the actress, with evident dislike in her face. \u201cThat was a psychological phenomenon, not an action,\u201d remarked Totski. \u201cAnd what about the maid?\u201d asked Nastasia Philipovna, with undisguised contempt. \u201cOh, she was turned out next day, of course. It\u2019s a very strict household, there!\u201d \u201cAnd you allowed it?\u201d \u201cI should think so, rather! I was not going to return and confess next day,\u201d laughed Ferdishenko, who seemed a little surprised at the disagreeable impression which his story had made on all parties. \u201cHow mean you were!\u201d said Nastasia. \u201cBah! you wish to hear a man tell of his worst actions, and you expect the story to come out goody-goody!", " It had to be something that he really and honestly considered the very worst action he had ever committed in his life. But he was to be honest--that was the chief point! He wasn\u2019t to be allowed to lie.\u201d \u201cWhat an extraordinary idea!\u201d said the general. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it, general!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a funny notion,\u201d said Totski, \u201cand yet quite natural--it\u2019s only a new way of boasting.\u201d \u201cPerhaps that is just what was so fascinating about it.\u201d \u201cWhy, it would be a game to cry over--not to laugh at!\u201d said the actress. \u201cDid it succeed?\u201d asked Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cCome, let\u2019s try it, let\u2019s try it; we really are not quite so jolly as we might be--let\u2019s try it! We may like it; it\u2019s original, at all events!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Ferdishenko; \u201cit\u2019s a good idea--come along--the men begin. Of course no one need tell a story if he prefers to be disobliging. We must draw lots! Throw your slips of paper, gentlemen, into this hat, and the prince shall draw for turns. It\u2019s a very simple game; all you have to do is to tell the story of the worst action of your life. It\u2019s as simple as anything. I\u2019ll prompt anyone who forgets the rules!\u201d No one liked the idea much. Some smiled, some frowned; some objected, but faintly, not wishing to oppose Nastasia\u2019s wishes; for this new idea seemed to be rather well received by her. She was still in an excited, hysterical state, laughing convulsively at nothing and everything. Her eyes were blazing, and her cheeks showed two bright red spots against the white.", " instead of tears and prayers to start her on her last journey, she has insults and jeers from a young ensign, who stands before her with his hands in his pockets, making a terrible row about a soup tureen!\u2019 Of course I was to blame, and even now that I have time to look back at it calmly, I pity the poor old thing no less. I repeat that I wonder at myself, for after all I was not really responsible. Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment? But the more I thought of it, the more I felt the weight of it upon my mind; and I never got quite rid of the impression until I put a couple of old women into an almshouse and kept them there at my own expense. There, that\u2019s all. I repeat I dare say I have committed many a grievous sin in my day; but I cannot help always looking back upon this as the worst action I have ever perpetrated.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m! and instead of a bad action, your excellency has detailed one of your noblest deeds,\u201d said Ferdishenko. \u201cFerdishenko is \u2018done.\u2019\u201d \u201cDear me, general,\u201d said Nastasia Philipovna, absently, \u201cI really never imagined you had such a good heart.\u201d The general laughed with great satisfaction, and applied himself once more to the champagne. It was now Totski\u2019s turn, and his story was awaited with great curiosity--while all eyes turned on Nastasia Philipovna, as though anticipating that his revelation must be connected somehow with her. Nastasia, during the whole of his story, pulled at the lace trimming of her sleeve, and never once glanced at the speaker.", " The melancholy appearance of some of her guests seemed to add to her sarcastic humour, and perhaps the very cynicism and cruelty of the game proposed by Ferdishenko pleased her. At all events she was attracted by the idea, and gradually her guests came round to her side; the thing was original, at least, and might turn out to be amusing. \u201cAnd supposing it\u2019s something that one--one can\u2019t speak about before ladies?\u201d asked the timid and silent young man. \u201cWhy, then of course, you won\u2019t say anything about it. As if there are not plenty of sins to your score without the need of those!\u201d said Ferdishenko. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t know which of my actions is the worst,\u201d said the lively actress. \u201cLadies are exempted if they like.\u201d \u201cAnd how are you to know that one isn\u2019t lying? And if one lies the whole point of the game is lost,\u201d said Gania. \u201cOh, but think how delightful to hear how one\u2019s friends lie! Besides you needn\u2019t be afraid, Gania; everybody knows what your worst action is without the need of any lying on your part. Only think, gentlemen,\u201d--and Ferdishenko here grew quite enthusiastic, \u201conly think with what eyes we shall observe one another tomorrow, after our tales have been told!\u201d \u201cBut surely this is a joke, Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d asked Totski. \u201cYou don\u2019t really mean us to play this game.\u201d \u201cWhoever is afraid of wolves had better not go into the wood,\u201d said Nastasia, smiling. \u201cBut, pardon me, Mr. Ferdishenko, is it possible to make a game out of this kind of thing?\u201d persisted Totski, growing more and more uneasy."], "Why does Ganya want to marry Nastassya Filippovna?": [" \u201cYou respect her very much, don\u2019t you?\u201d she added, quite unconscious of the naiveness of the question. \u201c_Very_ much; and I am so glad that you have realized the fact.\u201d \u201cI am very glad, too, because she is often laughed at by people. But listen to the chief point. I have long thought over the matter, and at last I have chosen you. I don\u2019t wish people to laugh at me; I don\u2019t wish people to think me a \u2018little fool.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be chaffed. I felt all this of a sudden, and I refused Evgenie Pavlovitch flatly, because I am not going to be forever thrown at people\u2019s heads to be married. I want--I want--well, I\u2019ll tell you, I wish to run away from home, and I have chosen you to help me.\u201d \u201cRun away from home?\u201d cried the prince. \u201cYes--yes--yes! Run away from home!\u201d she repeated, in a transport of rage. \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t be made to blush every minute by them all! I don\u2019t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or anyone, and therefore I have chosen you. I shall tell you everything, _everything_, even the most important things of all, whenever I like, and you are to hide nothing from me on your side. I want to speak to at least one person, as I would to myself. They have suddenly begun to say that I am waiting for you, and in love with you. They began this before you arrived here, and so I didn\u2019t show them the letter, and now they all say it, every one of them. I want to be brave, and be afraid of nobody.", " Suddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s portrait, gazing at it. \u201cDo you admire that sort of woman, prince?\u201d he asked, looking intently at him. He seemed to have some special object in the question. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful face,\u201d said the prince, \u201cand I feel sure that her destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. Her face is smiling enough, but she must have suffered terribly--hasn\u2019t she? Her eyes show it--those two bones there, the little points under her eyes, just where the cheek begins. It\u2019s a proud face too, terribly proud! And I--I can\u2019t say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she be but good! That would make all well!\u201d \u201cAnd would you marry a woman like that, now?\u201d continued Gania, never taking his excited eyes off the prince\u2019s face. \u201cI cannot marry at all,\u201d said the latter. \u201cI am an invalid.\u201d \u201cWould Rogojin marry her, do you think?\u201d \u201cWhy not? Certainly he would, I should think. He would marry her tomorrow!--marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week!\u201d Hardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a fearful shudder that the prince almost cried out. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said he, seizing Gania\u2019s hand. \u201cYour highness! His excellency begs your presence in her excellency\u2019s apartments!\u201d announced the footman, appearing at the door. The prince immediately followed the man out of the room. IV.", " I don\u2019t want to go to their balls and things--I want to do good. I have long desired to run away, for I have been kept shut up for twenty years, and they are always trying to marry me off. I wanted to run away when I was fourteen years old--I was a little fool then, I know--but now I have worked it all out, and I have waited for you to tell me about foreign countries. I have never seen a single Gothic cathedral. I must go to Rome; I must see all the museums; I must study in Paris. All this last year I have been preparing and reading forbidden books. Alexandra and Adelaida are allowed to read anything they like, but I mayn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to quarrel with my sisters, but I told my parents long ago that I wish to change my social position. I have decided to take up teaching, and I count on you because you said you loved children. Can we go in for education together--if not at once, then afterwards? We could do good together. I won\u2019t be a general\u2019s daughter any more! Tell me, are you a very learned man?\u201d \u201cOh no; not at all.\u201d \u201cOh-h-h! I\u2019m sorry for that. I thought you were. I wonder why I always thought so--but at all events you\u2019ll help me, won\u2019t you?

She\u2019s sworn to it! Ha, ha! She says to me, \u2018Until then I won\u2019t marry you. When they go to church, we\u2019ll go too--and not before.\u2019 What on earth does she mean by it? I don\u2019t know, and I never did. Either she loves you without limits or--yet, if she loves you, why does she wish to marry you to another girl? She says, \u2018I want to see him happy,\u2019 which is to say--she loves you.\u201d \u201cI wrote, and I say to you once more, that she is not in her right mind,\u201d said the prince, who had listened with anguish to what Rogojin said. \u201cGoodness knows--you may be wrong there! At all events, she named the day this evening, as we left the gardens. \u2018In three weeks,\u2019 says she, \u2018and perhaps sooner, we shall be married.\u2019 She swore to it, took off her cross and kissed it.

If she were insane they would observe it in her letters.\u201d \u201cWhat letters?\u201d said the prince, alarmed. \u201cShe writes to _her_--and the girl reads the letters. Haven\u2019t you heard?--You are sure to hear; she\u2019s sure to show you the letters herself.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t believe this!\u201d cried the prince."], "How much money does Rogozhin bring to Nastassya Filippovna's on the evening of her party?": [" \u201cOh yes!\u201d cried the prince, starting. \u201cHippolyte\u2019s suicide--\u201d \u201cWhat?

How could you sleep here after that?\u201d she cried, growing suddenly animated. \u201cOh, but he didn\u2019t kill himself; the pistol didn\u2019t go off.\u201d Aglaya insisted on hearing the whole story. She hurried the prince along, but interrupted him with all sorts of questions, nearly all of which were irrelevant. Among other things, she seemed greatly interested in every word that Evgenie Pavlovitch had said, and made the prince repeat that part of the story over and over again. \u201cWell, that\u2019ll do; we must be quick,\u201d she concluded, after hearing all. \u201cWe have only an hour here, till eight; I must be home by then without fail, so that they may not find out that I came and sat here with you; but I\u2019ve come on business. I have a great deal to say to you. But you have bowled me over considerably with your news. As to Hippolyte, I think his pistol was bound not to go off; it was more consistent with the whole affair. Are you sure he really wished to blow his brains out, and that there was no humbug about the matter?\u201d \u201cNo humbug at all.\u201d \u201cVery likely. So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his confession, did he? Why didn\u2019t you bring it?\u201d \u201cWhy, he didn\u2019t die!

Besides, he\u2019s my friend, prince, so that I shall not lose sight of him, again. Where he goes, I go. He\u2019s quite given up visiting the captain\u2019s widow, though sometimes he thinks sadly of her, especially in the morning, when he\u2019s putting on his boots. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s at that time. But he has no money, and it\u2019s no use his going to see her without. Has he borrowed any money from you, prince?\u201d \u201cNo, he has not.\u201d \u201cAh, he\u2019s ashamed to! He _meant_ to ask you, I know, for he said so. I suppose he thinks that as you gave him some once (you remember), you would probably refuse if he asked you again.\u201d \u201cDo you ever give him money?\u201d \u201cPrince! Money! Why I would give that man not only my money, but my very life, if he wanted it. Well, perhaps that\u2019s exaggeration; not life, we\u2019ll say, but some illness, a boil or a bad cough, or anything of that sort, I would stand with pleasure, for his sake; for I consider him a great man fallen--money, indeed!\u201d \u201cH\u2019m, then you _do_ give him money?\u201d \u201cN-no, I have never given him money, and he knows well that I will never give him any; because I am anxious to keep him out of intemperate ways.", " How was it?\u201d \u201cOh, the wine is to blame, of course. I confess to you, prince, as I would to Providence itself. Yesterday I received four hundred roubles from a debtor at about five in the afternoon, and came down here by train. I had my purse in my pocket. When I changed, I put the money into the pocket of my plain clothes, intending to keep it by me, as I expected to have an applicant for it in the evening.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true then, Lebedeff, that you advertise to lend money on gold or silver articles?\u201d \u201cYes, through an agent. My own name doesn\u2019t appear. I have a large family, you see, and at a small percentage--\u201d \u201cQuite so, quite so. I only asked for information--excuse the question. Go on.\u201d \u201cWell, meanwhile that sick boy was brought here, and those guests came in, and we had tea, and--well, we made merry--to my ruin! Hearing of your birthday afterwards, and excited with the circumstances of the evening, I ran upstairs and changed my plain clothes once more for my uniform [Civil Service clerks in Russia wear uniform.] --you must have noticed I had my uniform on all the evening? Well, I forgot the money in the pocket of my old coat--you know when God will ruin a man he first of all bereaves him of his senses--and it was only this morning at half-past seven that I woke up and grabbed at my coat pocket, first thing. The pocket was empty--the purse gone, and not a trace to be found!\u201d \u201cDear me!", " He was ready, in the same way, to do a base action in order to obtain his wished-for object; and yet, when the moment came to do it, he found that he was too honest for any great baseness. (Not that he objected to acts of petty meanness--he was always ready for _them_.) He looked with hate and loathing on the poverty and downfall of his family, and treated his mother with haughty contempt, although he knew that his whole future depended on her character and reputation. Aglaya had simply frightened him; yet he did not give up all thoughts of her--though he never seriously hoped that she would condescend to him. At the time of his \u201cadventure\u201d with Nastasia Philipovna he had come to the conclusion that money was his only hope--money should do all for him. At the moment when he lost Aglaya, and after the scene with Nastasia, he had felt so low in his own eyes that he actually brought the money back to the prince. Of this returning of the money given to him by a madwoman who had received it from a madman, he had often repented since--though he never ceased to be proud of his action. During the short time that Muishkin remained in Petersburg Gania had had time to come to hate him for his sympathy, though the prince told him that it was \u201cnot everyone who would have acted so nobly\u201d as to return the money. He had long pondered, too, over his relations with Aglaya, and had persuaded himself that with such a strange, childish, innocent character as hers, things might have ended very differently."], "With what does Rogozhin attempt to kill the Prince?": [" But every soul is a mystery, and depths of mystery lie in the soul of a Russian. He had been intimate with Rogojin, for example, and a brotherly friendship had sprung up between them--yet did he really know him? What chaos and ugliness fills the world at times! What a self-satisfied rascal is that nephew of Lebedeff\u2019s! \u201cBut what am I thinking,\u201d continued the prince to himself. \u201cCan he really have committed that crime? Did he kill those six persons? I seem to be confusing things... how strange it all is.... My head goes round... And Lebedeff\u2019s daughter--how sympathetic and charming her face was as she held the child in her arms! What an innocent look and child-like laugh she had! It is curious that I had forgotten her until now. I expect Lebedeff adores her--and I really believe, when I think of it, that as sure as two and two make four, he is fond of that nephew, too!\u201d Well, why should he judge them so hastily! Could he really say what they were, after one short visit? Even Lebedeff seemed an enigma today. Did he expect to find him so? He had never seen him like that before. Lebedeff and the Comtesse du Barry! Good Heavens! If Rogojin should really kill someone, it would not, at any rate, be such a senseless, chaotic affair. A knife made to a special pattern, and six people killed in a kind of delirium. But Rogojin also had a knife made to a special pattern. Can it be that Rogojin wishes to murder anyone?", " But I have renounced the world. You think it strange that I should say so, for you saw me decked with lace and diamonds, in the company of drunkards and wastrels. Take no notice of that; I know that I have almost ceased to exist. God knows what it is dwelling within me now--it is not myself. I can see it every day in two dreadful eyes which are always looking at me, even when not present. These eyes are silent now, they say nothing; but I know their secret. His house is gloomy, and there is a secret in it. I am convinced that in some box he has a razor hidden, tied round with silk, just like the one that Moscow murderer had. This man also lived with his mother, and had a razor hidden away, tied round with white silk, and with this razor he intended to cut a throat. \u201cAll the while I was in their house I felt sure that somewhere beneath the floor there was hidden away some dreadful corpse, wrapped in oil-cloth, perhaps buried there by his father, who knows? Just as in the Moscow case. I could have shown you the very spot! \u201cHe is always silent, but I know well that he loves me so much that he must hate me. My wedding and yours are to be on the same day; so I have arranged with him. I have no secrets from him. I would kill him from very fright, but he will kill me first. He has just burst out laughing, and says that I am raving. He knows I am writing to you.\u201d There was much more of this delirious wandering in the letters--one of them was very long.", " I have heard of such things before, but never came across, till tonight, a man who would actually shoot himself in order to gain a vulgar notoriety, or blow out his brains for spite, if he finds that people don\u2019t care to pat him on the back for his sanguinary intentions. But what astonishes me more than anything is the fellow\u2019s candid confession of weakness. You\u2019d better get rid of him tomorrow, in any case.\u201d \u201cDo you think he will make another attempt?\u201d \u201cOh no, not he, not now! But you have to be very careful with this sort of gentleman. Crime is too often the last resource of these petty nonentities. This young fellow is quite capable of cutting the throats of ten people, simply for a lark, as he told us in his \u2018explanation.\u2019 I assure you those confounded words of his will not let me sleep.\u201d \u201cI think you disturb yourself too much.\u201d \u201cWhat an extraordinary person you are, prince! Do you mean to say that you doubt the fact that he is capable of murdering ten men?\u201d \u201cI daren\u2019t say, one way or the other; all this is very strange--but--\u201d \u201cWell, as you like, just as you like,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, irritably. \u201cOnly you are such a plucky fellow, take care you don\u2019t get included among the ten victims!\u201d \u201cOh, he is much more likely not to kill anyone at all,\u201d said the prince, gazing thoughtfully at Evgenie. The latter laughed disagreeably. \u201cWell, _au revoir!_ Did you observe that he \u2018willed\u2019 a copy of his confession to Aglaya Ivanovna?\u201d \u201cYes, I did; I am thinking of it.\u201d \u201cIn connection with \u2018the ten,\u2019 eh?\u201d laughed Evgenie, as he left the room.", " You know he is in love with Aglaya himself, now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha Prokofievna!\u201d \u201cOh! he\u2019s not dangerous there!\u201d cried Gania, laughing angrily. \u201cHowever, I believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is very likely to be in love, for he is a mere boy. But he won\u2019t write anonymous letters to the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing for him to attempt; but I dare swear the very first thing he did was to show me up to Aglaya as a base deceiver and intriguer. I confess I was fool enough to attempt something through him at first. I thought he would throw himself into my service out of revengeful feelings towards the prince, the sly little beast! But I know him better now. As for the theft, he may have heard of it from the widow in Petersburg, for if the old man committed himself to such an act, he can have done it for no other object but to give the money to her. Hippolyte said to me, without any prelude, that the general had promised the widow four hundred roubles. Of course I understood, and the little wretch looked at me with a nasty sort of satisfaction. I know him; you may depend upon it he went and told mother too, for the pleasure of wounding her. And why doesn\u2019t he die, I should like to know? He undertook to die within three weeks, and here he is getting fatter. His cough is better, too. It was only yesterday that he said that was the second day he hadn\u2019t coughed blood.\u201d \u201cWell, turn him out!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t _hate_, I despise him,\u201d said Gania, grandly."], "With what painting of Rogozhin's is Myshkin impressed?": [" Do help me to a subject, prince.\u201d \u201cOh, but I know nothing about painting. It seems to me one only has to look, and paint what one sees.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t know _how_ to see!\u201d \u201cNonsense, what rubbish you talk!\u201d the mother struck in. \u201cNot know how to see! Open your eyes and look! If you can\u2019t see here, you won\u2019t see abroad either. Tell us what you saw yourself, prince!\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s better,\u201d said Adelaida; \u201cthe prince _learned to see_ abroad.\u201d \u201cOh, I hardly know! You see, I only went to restore my health. I don\u2019t know whether I learned to see, exactly. I was very happy, however, nearly all the time.\u201d \u201cHappy! you can be happy?\u201d cried Aglaya. \u201cThen how can you say you did not learn to see? I should think you could teach _us_ to see!\u201d \u201cOh! _do_ teach us,\u201d laughed Adelaida. \u201cOh! I can\u2019t do that,\u201d said the prince, laughing too. \u201cI lived almost all the while in one little Swiss village; what can I teach you? At first I was only just not absolutely dull; then my health began to improve--then every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the longer I stayed, the dearer became the time to me; so much so that I could not help observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult to say.\u201d \u201cSo that you didn\u2019t care to go away anywhere else?\u201d \u201cWell, at first I did; I was restless; I didn\u2019t know however I should manage to support life--you know there are such moments, especially in solitude.", " What a curious expression you have!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d said Varia, in a tone that sounded as though she were all wrong. Gania looked more intently at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been _there?_\u201d he asked, suddenly. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDid you find out anything?\u201d \u201cNothing unexpected. I discovered that it\u2019s all true. My husband was wiser than either of us. Just as he suspected from the beginning, so it has fallen out. Where is he?\u201d \u201cOut. Well--what has happened?--go on.\u201d \u201cThe prince is formally engaged to her--that\u2019s settled. The elder sisters told me about it. Aglaya has agreed. They don\u2019t attempt to conceal it any longer; you know how mysterious and secret they have all been up to now. Adelaida\u2019s wedding is put off again, so that both can be married on one day. Isn\u2019t that delightfully romantic? Somebody ought to write a poem on it. Sit down and write an ode instead of tearing up and down like that. This evening Princess Bielokonski is to arrive; she comes just in time--they have a party tonight. He is to be presented to old Bielokonski, though I believe he knows her already; probably the engagement will be openly announced. They are only afraid that he may knock something down, or trip over something when he comes into the room. It would be just like him.\u201d Gania listened attentively, but to his sister\u2019s astonishment he was by no means so impressed by this news (which should, she thought, have been so important to him) as she had expected.", " A painful recollection flashed into his mind. He stood for a time, looking straight at Rogojin, whose eyes seemed to blaze like fire. At last Rogojin smiled, though he still looked agitated and shaken. \u201cWhat are you staring at me like that for?\u201d he muttered. \u201cSit down.\u201d The prince took a chair. \u201cParfen,\u201d he said, \u201ctell me honestly, did you know that I was coming to Petersburg or no?\u201d \u201cOh, I supposed you were coming,\u201d the other replied, smiling sarcastically, \u201cand I was right in my supposition, you see; but how was I to know that you would come _today?_\u201d A certain strangeness and impatience in his manner impressed the prince very forcibly. \u201cAnd if you had known that I was coming today, why be so irritated about it?\u201d he asked, in quiet surprise. \u201cWhy did you ask me?\u201d \u201cBecause when I jumped out of the train this morning, two eyes glared at me just as yours did a moment since.\u201d \u201cHa! and whose eyes may they have been?\u201d said Rogojin, suspiciously. It seemed to the prince that he was trembling. \u201cI don\u2019t know; I thought it was a hallucination. I often have hallucinations nowadays. I feel just as I did five years ago when my fits were about to come on.\u201d \u201cWell, perhaps it was a hallucination, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Parfen. He tried to give the prince an affectionate smile, and it seemed to the latter as though in this smile of his something had broken, and that he could not mend it, try as he would.", " Enraged at this idea, he started up, crossed the dark passage (which filled him with horrible impressions and gloomy forebodings), and set out once more for Rogojin\u2019s. Rogojin had not returned, and no one came to the door. He rang at the old lady\u2019s door opposite, and was informed that Parfen Semionovitch would not return for three days. The curiosity with which the old servant stared at him again impressed the prince disagreeably. He could not find the porter this time at all. As before, he crossed the street and watched the windows from the other side, walking up and down in anguish of soul for half an hour or so in the stifling heat. Nothing stirred; the blinds were motionless; indeed, the prince began to think that the apparition of Rogojin\u2019s face could have been nothing but fancy. Soothed by this thought, he drove off once more to his friends at the Ismailofsky barracks. He was expected there. The mother had already been to three or four places to look for Nastasia, but had not found a trace of any kind. The prince said nothing, but entered the room, sat down silently, and stared at them, one after the other, with the air of a man who cannot understand what is being said to him. It was strange--one moment he seemed to be so observant, the next so absent; his behaviour struck all the family as most remarkable. At length he rose from his seat, and begged to be shown Nastasia\u2019s rooms."], "What prevents Rogozhin from killing the Prince?": [" Is that what you meant?\u201d \u201cWhat Osterman?\u201d asked the prince in some surprise. \u201cWhy, Osterman--the diplomatist. Peter\u2019s Osterman,\u201d muttered Hippolyte, confused. There was a moment\u2019s pause of mutual confusion. \u201cOh, no, no!\u201d said the prince at last, \u201cthat was not what I was going to say--oh no! I don\u2019t think you would ever have been like Osterman.\u201d Hippolyte frowned gloomily. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why I draw the conclusion,\u201d explained the prince, evidently desirous of clearing up the matter a little. \u201cBecause, though I often think over the men of those times, I cannot for the life of me imagine them to be like ourselves. It really appears to me that they were of another race altogether than ourselves of today. At that time people seemed to stick so to one idea; now, they are more nervous, more sensitive, more enlightened--people of two or three ideas at once--as it were. The man of today is a broader man, so to speak--and I declare I believe that is what prevents him from being so self-contained and independent a being as his brother of those earlier days. Of course my remark was only made under this impression, and not in the least--\u201d \u201cI quite understand. You are trying to comfort me for the naiveness with which you disagreed with me--eh? Ha! ha! ha! You are a regular child, prince! However, I cannot help seeing that you always treat me like--like a fragile china cup. Never mind, never mind, I\u2019m not a bit angry!", " \u201cI was watching for you, prince,\u201d said the individual. \u201cIs that you, Keller?\u201d said the prince, in surprise. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been looking for you. I waited for you at the Epanchins\u2019 house, but of course I could not come in. I dogged you from behind as you walked along with the general. Well, prince, here is Keller, absolutely at your service--command him!--ready to sacrifice himself--even to die in case of need.\u201d \u201cBut--why?\u201d \u201cOh, why?--Of course you\u2019ll be challenged! That was young Lieutenant Moloftsoff. I know him, or rather of him; he won\u2019t pass an insult. He will take no notice of Rogojin and myself, and, therefore, you are the only one left to account for. You\u2019ll have to pay the piper, prince. He has been asking about you, and undoubtedly his friend will call on you tomorrow--perhaps he is at your house already. If you would do me the honour to have me for a second, prince, I should be happy. That\u2019s why I have been looking for you now.\u201d \u201cDuel! You\u2019ve come to talk about a duel, too!\u201d The prince burst out laughing, to the great astonishment of Keller. He laughed unrestrainedly, and Keller, who had been on pins and needles, and in a fever of excitement to offer himself as \u201csecond,\u201d was very near being offended. \u201cYou caught him by the arms, you know, prince. No man of proper pride can stand that sort of treatment in public.\u201d \u201cYes, and he gave me a fearful dig in the chest,\u201d cried the prince, still laughing.", " You know nothing about the thing, and yet--idiot!\u201d he added, muttering the last word to himself in irrepressible rage. \u201cI am very sorry; I was not thinking at the time. I merely said that Aglaya was almost as beautiful as Nastasia Philipovna.\u201d Gania asked for further details; and the prince once more repeated the conversation. Gania looked at him with ironical contempt the while. \u201cNastasia Philipovna,\u201d he began, and there paused; he was clearly much agitated and annoyed. The prince reminded him of the portrait. \u201cListen, prince,\u201d said Gania, as though an idea had just struck him, \u201cI wish to ask you a great favour, and yet I really don\u2019t know--\u201d He paused again, he was trying to make up his mind to something, and was turning the matter over. The prince waited quietly. Once more Gania fixed him with intent and questioning eyes. \u201cPrince,\u201d he began again, \u201cthey are rather angry with me, in there, owing to a circumstance which I need not explain, so that I do not care to go in at present without an invitation. I particularly wish to speak to Aglaya, but I have written a few words in case I shall not have the chance of seeing her\u201d (here the prince observed a small note in his hand), \u201cand I do not know how to get my communication to her. Don\u2019t you think you could undertake to give it to her at once, but only to her, mind, and so that no one else should see you give it? It isn\u2019t much of a secret, but still--Well, will you do it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t quite like it,\u201d replied the prince.", " In the first place, what do you mean by \u2018before company\u2019? Isn\u2019t the company good enough for you? And what\u2019s all that about \u2018a game\u2019? I wished to tell my little story, and I told it! Don\u2019t you like it? You heard what I said to the prince? \u2018As you decide, so it shall be!\u2019 If he had said \u2018yes,\u2019 I should have given my consent! But he said \u2018no,\u2019 so I refused. Here was my whole life hanging on his one word! Surely I was serious enough?\u201d \u201cThe prince! What on earth has the prince got to do with it? Who the deuce is the prince?\u201d cried the general, who could conceal his wrath no longer. \u201cThe prince has this to do with it--that I see in him for the first time in all my life, a man endowed with real truthfulness of spirit, and I trust him. He trusted me at first sight, and I trust him!\u201d \u201cIt only remains for me, then, to thank Nastasia Philipovna for the great delicacy with which she has treated me,\u201d said Gania, as pale as death, and with quivering lips. \u201cThat is my plain duty, of course; but the prince--what has he to do in the matter?\u201d \u201cI see what you are driving at,\u201d said Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cYou imply that the prince is after the seventy-five thousand roubles--I quite understand you. Mr. Totski, I forgot to say, \u2018Take your seventy-five thousand roubles\u2019--I don\u2019t want them. I let you go free for nothing--take your freedom! You must need it. Nine years and three months\u2019 captivity is enough for anybody."], "What poem does Aglaya recite in front of her family and the Prince in Pavlovsk?": [" If she had taken to stealing, he would have championed her just the same. I think the poet desired to embody in this one picture the whole spirit of medieval chivalry and the platonic love of a pure and high-souled knight. Of course it\u2019s all an ideal, and in the \u2018poor knight\u2019 that spirit reached the utmost limit of asceticism. He is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical. I used not to understand him, and laughed at him, but now I love the \u2018poor knight,\u2019 and respect his actions.\u201d So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to judge whether she was joking or in earnest. \u201cPooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin; \u201cand as for you, young woman, you ought to know better. At all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it? Recite it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life. Prince, you must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort of thing! Be patient!\u201d They certainly were put out, both of them. The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could not get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the least embarrassed. She seemed, in fact, quite pleased. She now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the terrace, and stood in front of the prince\u2019s chair. All looked on with some surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided alarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far enough already, they thought.", " He easily concluded that this was Evgenie Pavlovitch Radomski, of whom he had already heard mention several times. He was puzzled, however, by the young man\u2019s plain clothes, for he had always heard of Evgenie Pavlovitch as a military man. An ironical smile played on Evgenie\u2019s lips all the while the recitation was proceeding, which showed that he, too, was probably in the secret of the \u2018poor knight\u2019 joke. But it had become quite a different matter with Aglaya. All the affectation of manner which she had displayed at the beginning disappeared as the ballad proceeded. She spoke the lines in so serious and exalted a manner, and with so much taste, that she even seemed to justify the exaggerated solemnity with which she had stepped forward. It was impossible to discern in her now anything but a deep feeling for the spirit of the poem which she had undertaken to interpret. Her eyes were aglow with inspiration, and a slight tremor of rapture passed over her lovely features once or twice. She continued to recite: \u201cOnce there came a vision glorious, Mystic, dreadful, wondrous fair; Burned itself into his spirit, And abode for ever there! \u201cNever more--from that sweet moment-- Gaz\u00e9d he on womankind; He was dumb to love and wooing And to all their graces blind. \u201cFull of love for that sweet vision, Brave and pure he took the field; With his blood he stained the letters N. P. B. upon his shield.", " \u201cThere is no silliness about it at all--only the profoundest respect,\u201d said Aglaya, very seriously. She had quite recovered her temper; in fact, from certain signs, it was fair to conclude that she was delighted to see this joke going so far; and a careful observer might have remarked that her satisfaction dated from the moment when the fact of the prince\u2019s confusion became apparent to all. \u201c\u2018Profoundest respect!\u2019 What nonsense! First, insane giggling, and then, all of a sudden, a display of \u2018profoundest respect.\u2019 Why respect? Tell me at once, why have you suddenly developed this \u2018profound respect,\u2019 eh?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d replied Aglaya gravely, \u201cin the poem the knight is described as a man capable of living up to an ideal all his life. That sort of thing is not to be found every day among the men of our times. In the poem it is not stated exactly what the ideal was, but it was evidently some vision, some revelation of pure Beauty, and the knight wore round his neck, instead of a scarf, a rosary. A device--A. N. B.--the meaning of which is not explained, was inscribed on his shield--\u201d \u201cNo, A. N. D.,\u201d corrected Colia. \u201cI say A. N. B., and so it shall be!\u201d cried Aglaya, irritably. \u201cAnyway, the \u2018poor knight\u2019 did not care what his lady was, or what she did. He had chosen his ideal, and he was bound to serve her, and break lances for her, and acknowledge her as the ideal of pure Beauty, whatever she might say or do afterwards.", " The happy state in which the family had spent the evening, as just recorded, was not of very long duration. Next day Aglaya quarrelled with the prince again, and so she continued to behave for the next few days. For whole hours at a time she ridiculed and chaffed the wretched man, and made him almost a laughing-stock. It is true that they used to sit in the little summer-house together for an hour or two at a time, very often, but it was observed that on these occasions the prince would read the paper, or some book, aloud to Aglaya. \u201cDo you know,\u201d Aglaya said to him once, interrupting the reading, \u201cI\u2019ve remarked that you are dreadfully badly educated.

No--don\u2019t! Stop reading!\u201d And once more, that same evening, Aglaya mystified them all.

I have no right to express my ideas, and said so long ago. Only in Moscow, with Rogojin, did I ever speak absolutely freely! He and I read Pushkin together--all his works. Rogojin knew nothing of Pushkin, had not even heard his name. I am always afraid of spoiling a great Thought or Idea by my absurd manner. I have no eloquence, I know. I always make the wrong gestures--inappropriate gestures--and therefore I degrade the Thought, and raise a laugh instead of doing my subject justice. I have no sense of proportion either, and that is the chief thing. I know it would be much better if I were always to sit still and say nothing. When I do so, I appear to be quite a sensible sort of a person, and what\u2019s more, I think about things. But now I must speak; it is better that I should. I began to speak because you looked so kindly at me; you have such a beautiful face. I promised Aglaya Ivanovna yesterday that I would not speak all the evening.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d said the old man, smiling. \u201cBut, at times, I can\u2019t help thinking that I am wrong in feeling so about it, you know. Sincerity is more important than elocution, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cSometimes.\u201d \u201cI want to explain all to you--everything--everything! I know you think me Utopian, don\u2019t you--an idealist? Oh, no! I\u2019m not, indeed--my ideas are all so simple. You don\u2019t believe me?", " If she had taken to stealing, he would have championed her just the same. I think the poet desired to embody in this one picture the whole spirit of medieval chivalry and the platonic love of a pure and high-souled knight. Of course it\u2019s all an ideal, and in the \u2018poor knight\u2019 that spirit reached the utmost limit of asceticism. He is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical. I used not to understand him, and laughed at him, but now I love the \u2018poor knight,\u2019 and respect his actions.\u201d So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to judge whether she was joking or in earnest. \u201cPooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin; \u201cand as for you, young woman, you ought to know better. At all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it? Recite it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life. Prince, you must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort of thing! Be patient!\u201d They certainly were put out, both of them. The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could not get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the least embarrassed. She seemed, in fact, quite pleased. She now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the terrace, and stood in front of the prince\u2019s chair. All looked on with some surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided alarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far enough already, they thought.", " General Epanchin only knew that there was a recitation of verses going on, and took no further interest in the matter. Of the rest of the audience, many had understood the allusion and wondered both at the daring of the lady and at the motive underlying it, but tried to show no sign of their feelings. But Evgenie Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager) both comprehended and tried his best to show that he comprehended; his smile was too mocking to leave any doubt on that point. \u201cHow beautiful that is!\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration. \u201cWhose is it?\u201d \u201cPushkin\u2019s, mama, of course! Don\u2019t disgrace us all by showing your ignorance,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cAs soon as we reach home give it to me to read.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house.\u201d \u201cThere are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying about from time immemorial,\u201d added Alexandra. \u201cSend Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy, then.--Aglaya, come here--kiss me, dear, you recited beautifully! but,\u201d she added in a whisper, \u201cif you were sincere I am sorry for you. If it was a joke, I do not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do it, and in any case you would have done far better not to recite it at all. Do you understand?--Now come along, young woman; we\u2019ve sat here too long. I\u2019ll speak to you about this another time.\u201d Meanwhile the prince took the opportunity of greeting General Epanchin, and the general introduced Evgenie Pavlovitch to him."], "How does Ganya prove that Burdovsky cannot possibly be Pavlishchev's son?": [" You said you wished to come to the point; please remember that it is after nine o\u2019clock.\u201d \u201cVery well, gentlemen--very well,\u201d replied the prince. \u201cAt first I received the news with mistrust, then I said to myself that I might be mistaken, and that Pavlicheff might possibly have had a son. But I was absolutely amazed at the readiness with which the son had revealed the secret of his birth at the expense of his mother\u2019s honour. For Tchebaroff had already menaced me with publicity in our interview....\u201d \u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d Lebedeff\u2019s nephew interrupted violently. \u201cYou have no right--you have no right!\u201d cried Burdovsky. \u201cThe son is not responsible for the misdeeds of his father; and the mother is not to blame,\u201d added Hippolyte, with warmth. \u201cThat seems to me all the more reason for sparing her,\u201d said the prince timidly. \u201cPrince, you are not only simple, but your simplicity is almost past the limit,\u201d said Lebedeff\u2019s nephew, with a sarcastic smile. \u201cBut what right had you?\u201d said Hippolyte in a very strange tone. \u201cNone--none whatever,\u201d agreed the prince hastily. \u201cI admit you are right there, but it was involuntary, and I immediately said to myself that my personal feelings had nothing to do with it,--that if I thought it right to satisfy the demands of Mr. Burdovsky, out of respect for the memory of Pavlicheff, I ought to do so in any case, whether I esteemed Mr. Burdovsky or not. I only mentioned this, gentlemen, because it seemed so unnatural to me for a son to betray his mother\u2019s secret in such a way.", " He has deceived poor Mr. Burdovsky, and all of you, gentlemen, who have come forward so nobly to support your friend--(he evidently needs support, I quite see that!). He has abused your credulity and involved you all in an attempted fraud, for when all is said and done this claim is nothing else!\u201d \u201cWhat! a fraud? What, he is not Pavlicheff\u2019s son? Impossible!\u201d These exclamations but feebly expressed the profound bewilderment into which the prince\u2019s words had plunged Burdovsky\u2019s companions. \u201cCertainly it is a fraud! Since Mr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff\u2019s son, his claim is neither more nor less than attempted fraud (supposing, of course, that he had known the truth), but the fact is that he has been deceived. I insist on this point in order to justify him; I repeat that his simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot stand alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this matter. But I feel certain that he does not understand it! I was just the same myself before I went to Switzerland; I stammered incoherently; one tries to express oneself and cannot. I understand that. I am all the better able to pity Mr. Burdovsky, because I know from experience what it is to be like that, and so I have a right to speak. Well, though there is no such person as \u2018Pavlicheff\u2019s son,\u2019 and it is all nothing but a humbug, yet I will keep to my decision, and I am prepared to give up ten thousand roubles in memory of Pavlicheff.", " Before Mr. Burdovsky made this claim, I proposed to found a school with this money, in memory of my benefactor, but I shall honour his memory quite as well by giving the ten thousand roubles to Mr. Burdovsky, because, though he was not Pavlicheff\u2019s son, he was treated almost as though he were. That is what gave a rogue the opportunity of deceiving him; he really did think himself Pavlicheff\u2019s son. Listen, gentlemen; this matter must be settled; keep calm; do not get angry; and sit down! Gavrila Ardalionovitch will explain everything to you at once, and I confess that I am very anxious to hear all the details myself. He says that he has even been to Pskoff to see your mother, Mr. Burdovsky; she is not dead, as the article which was just read to us makes out. Sit down, gentlemen, sit down!\u201d The prince sat down, and at length prevailed upon Burdovsky\u2019s company to do likewise. During the last ten or twenty minutes, exasperated by continual interruptions, he had raised his voice, and spoken with great vehemence. Now, no doubt, he bitterly regretted several words and expressions which had escaped him in his excitement. If he had not been driven beyond the limits of endurance, he would not have ventured to express certain conjectures so openly. He had no sooner sat down than his heart was torn by sharp remorse. Besides insulting Burdovsky with the supposition, made in the presence of witnesses, that he was suffering from the complaint for which he had himself been treated in Switzerland, he reproached himself with the grossest indelicacy in having offered him the ten thousand roubles before everyone.", " Can you put him up, Lef Nicolaievitch? I hope you are not bored, dear prince,\u201d she added suddenly to Prince S. \u201cAlexandra, my dear, come here! Your hair is coming down.\u201d She arranged her daughter\u2019s hair, which was not in the least disordered, and gave her a kiss. This was all that she had called her for. \u201cI thought you were capable of development,\u201d said Hippolyte, coming out of his fit of abstraction. \u201cYes, that is what I meant to say,\u201d he added, with the satisfaction of one who suddenly remembers something he had forgotten. \u201cHere is Burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his mother; is not that so? And he himself is the cause of her disgrace. The prince is anxious to help Burdovsky and offers him friendship and a large sum of money, in the sincerity of his heart. And here they stand like two sworn enemies--ha, ha, ha! You all hate Burdovsky because his behaviour with regard to his mother is shocking and repugnant to you; do you not? Is not that true? Is it not true? You all have a passion for beauty and distinction in outward forms; that is all you care for, isn\u2019t it? I have suspected for a long time that you cared for nothing else! Well, let me tell you that perhaps there is not one of you who loved your mother as Burdovsky loved his. As to you, prince, I know that you have sent money secretly to Burdovsky\u2019s mother through Gania. Well, I bet now,\u201d he continued with an hysterical laugh, \u201cthat Burdovsky will accuse you of indelicacy, and reproach you with a want of respect for his mother!"], "What object outside his window in St. Petersburg does Hippolite spends so many hours staring at?": [" He was very deeply mortified. II. It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St. Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the family had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide him. It must have been a hallucination. But the disagreeable impression remained, and without this, the prince was sad and thoughtful already, and seemed to be much preoccupied. His cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya. Here he engaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished. He washed and changed, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to waste no time. Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he left Petersburg would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his exterior was concerned. His clothes certainly were very different; they were more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to mockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance.", " \u201cQuite so,\u201d replied the general, \u201cand what can I do for you?\u201d \u201cOh, I have no special business; my principal object was to make your acquaintance. I should not like to disturb you. I do not know your times and arrangements here, you see, but I have only just arrived. I came straight from the station. I am come direct from Switzerland.\u201d The general very nearly smiled, but thought better of it and kept his smile back. Then he reflected, blinked his eyes, stared at his guest once more from head to foot; then abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat down himself, and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak. Gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room, turning over papers. \u201cI have not much time for making acquaintances, as a rule,\u201d said the general, \u201cbut as, of course, you have your object in coming, I--\u201d \u201cI felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved to pay you this visit,\u201d the prince interrupted; \u201cbut I give you my word, beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal object whatever.\u201d \u201cThe pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as you are aware. There is such a thing as business, and I really do not see what possible reason there can be, or what we have in common to--\u201d \u201cOh, there is no reason, of course, and I suppose there is nothing in common between us, or very little; for if I am Prince Muishkin, and your wife happens to be a member of my house, that can hardly be called a \u2018reason.\u2019 I quite understand that.", " In spite of the kindly-meant consolations of his new friends, the prince walked to his hotel in inexpressible anguish of spirit, through the hot, dusty streets, aimlessly staring at the faces of those who passed him. Arrived at his destination, he determined to rest awhile in his room before he started for Rogojin\u2019s once more. He sat down, rested his elbows on the table and his head on his hands, and fell to thinking. Heaven knows how long and upon what subjects he thought. He thought of many things--of Vera Lebedeff, and of her father; of Hippolyte; of Rogojin himself, first at the funeral, then as he had met him in the park, then, suddenly, as they had met in this very passage, outside, when Rogojin had watched in the darkness and awaited him with uplifted knife. The prince remembered his enemy\u2019s eyes as they had glared at him in the darkness. He shuddered, as a sudden idea struck him. This idea was, that if Rogojin were in Petersburg, though he might hide for a time, yet he was quite sure to come to him--the prince--before long, with either good or evil intentions, but probably with the same intention as on that other occasion. At all events, if Rogojin were to come at all he would be sure to seek the prince here--he had no other town address--perhaps in this same corridor; he might well seek him here if he needed him. And perhaps he did need him. This idea seemed quite natural to the prince, though he could not have explained why he should so suddenly have become necessary to Rogojin.", " I felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have been tempted to cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was my best justification. Such a woman could make anyone forget all reason--everything! Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her a hundred thousand roubles! Of course, all that happened tonight was ephemeral, fantastic, unseemly--yet it lacked neither colour nor originality. My God! What might not have been made of such a character combined with such beauty! Yet in spite of all efforts--in spite of all education, even--all those gifts are wasted! She is an uncut diamond.... I have often said so.\u201d And Afanasy Ivanovitch heaved a deep sigh. PART II I. Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s birthday party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this story, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in order to see after some business connected with the receipt of his unexpected fortune. It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little information. The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about him all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last."], "Why does Hippolite's suicide attempt fail?": [" \u201cOh yes!\u201d cried the prince, starting. \u201cHippolyte\u2019s suicide--\u201d \u201cWhat? At your house?\u201d she asked, but without much surprise. \u201cHe was alive yesterday evening, wasn\u2019t he? How could you sleep here after that?\u201d she cried, growing suddenly animated. \u201cOh, but he didn\u2019t kill himself; the pistol didn\u2019t go off.\u201d Aglaya insisted on hearing the whole story. She hurried the prince along, but interrupted him with all sorts of questions, nearly all of which were irrelevant. Among other things, she seemed greatly interested in every word that Evgenie Pavlovitch had said, and made the prince repeat that part of the story over and over again. \u201cWell, that\u2019ll do; we must be quick,\u201d she concluded, after hearing all. \u201cWe have only an hour here, till eight; I must be home by then without fail, so that they may not find out that I came and sat here with you; but I\u2019ve come on business. I have a great deal to say to you. But you have bowled me over considerably with your news. As to Hippolyte, I think his pistol was bound not to go off; it was more consistent with the whole affair. Are you sure he really wished to blow his brains out, and that there was no humbug about the matter?\u201d \u201cNo humbug at all.\u201d \u201cVery likely. So he wrote that you were to bring me a copy of his confession, did he? Why didn\u2019t you bring it?\u201d \u201cWhy, he didn\u2019t die! I\u2019ll ask him for it, if you like.\u201d \u201cBring it by all means; you needn\u2019t ask him.", " You know he is in love with Aglaya himself, now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha Prokofievna!\u201d \u201cOh! he\u2019s not dangerous there!\u201d cried Gania, laughing angrily. \u201cHowever, I believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is very likely to be in love, for he is a mere boy. But he won\u2019t write anonymous letters to the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing for him to attempt; but I dare swear the very first thing he did was to show me up to Aglaya as a base deceiver and intriguer. I confess I was fool enough to attempt something through him at first. I thought he would throw himself into my service out of revengeful feelings towards the prince, the sly little beast! But I know him better now. As for the theft, he may have heard of it from the widow in Petersburg, for if the old man committed himself to such an act, he can have done it for no other object but to give the money to her. Hippolyte said to me, without any prelude, that the general had promised the widow four hundred roubles. Of course I understood, and the little wretch looked at me with a nasty sort of satisfaction. I know him; you may depend upon it he went and told mother too, for the pleasure of wounding her. And why doesn\u2019t he die, I should like to know? He undertook to die within three weeks, and here he is getting fatter. His cough is better, too. It was only yesterday that he said that was the second day he hadn\u2019t coughed blood.\u201d \u201cWell, turn him out!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t _hate_, I despise him,\u201d said Gania, grandly.", " So he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect. Having arrived at Nastasia\u2019s house one day, with Epanchin, Totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of his position. He admitted that he was to blame for all, but candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse for his original guilt towards herself, because he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and ineradicable, and that he had no power over himself in this respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry at last, and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided his all to her generosity of heart. General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father of a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any attempt at sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of her right to be the arbiter of Totski\u2019s destiny at this moment. He then pointed out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his other daughters, now hung upon her reply. To Nastasia\u2019s question as to what they wished her to do, Totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married. He immediately added that such a suggestion from him would, of course, be absurd, unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature.", " \u201cWhat is the good of it?\u201d repeated Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with pretended surprise. \u201cWell, firstly, because now perhaps Mr. Burdovsky is quite convinced that Mr. Pavlicheff\u2019s love for him came simply from generosity of soul, and not from paternal duty. It was most necessary to impress this fact upon his mind, considering that he approved of the article written by Mr. Keller. I speak thus because I look on you, Mr. Burdovsky, as an honourable man. Secondly, it appears that there was no intention of cheating in this case, even on the part of Tchebaroff. I wish to say this quite plainly, because the prince hinted a while ago that I too thought it an attempt at robbery and extortion. On the contrary, everyone has been quite sincere in the matter, and although Tchebaroff may be somewhat of a rogue, in this business he has acted simply as any sharp lawyer would do under the circumstances. He looked at it as a case that might bring him in a lot of money, and he did not calculate badly; because on the one hand he speculated on the generosity of the prince, and his gratitude to the late Mr. Pavlicheff, and on the other to his chivalrous ideas as to the obligations of honour and conscience. As to Mr. Burdovsky, allowing for his principles, we may acknowledge that he engaged in the business with very little personal aim in view. At the instigation of Tchebaroff and his other friends, he decided to make the attempt in the service of truth, progress, and humanity."], "Why does Nastassya Filippovna speak on such friendly terms with Yevgeny Radomsky?": [" Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing, announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined tastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty. Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated. Might he suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the general\u2019s daughters? Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the Epanchins was about to undergo a change. The undoubted beauty of the family, _par excellence_, was the youngest, Aglaya, as aforesaid. But Totski himself, though an egotist of the extremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was clearly not for such as he. Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or less exaggerated Aglaya\u2019s chances of happiness. In their opinion, the latter\u2019s destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in a heaven on earth. Aglaya\u2019s husband was to be a compendium of all the virtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth.", " Muiskhin looked disturbed, but continued to gaze intently and questioningly into Prince S.\u2019s face. The latter, however, remained silent. \u201cThen it was not simply a matter of bills?\u201d Muishkin said at last, with some impatience. \u201cIt was not as she said?\u201d \u201cBut I ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common between Evgenie Pavlovitch, and--her, and again Rogojin? I tell you he is a man of immense wealth--as I know for a fact; and he has further expectations from his uncle. Simply Nastasia Philipovna--\u201d Prince S. paused, as though unwilling to continue talking about Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cThen at all events he knows her!\u201d remarked the prince, after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cOh, that may be. He may have known her some time ago--two or three years, at least. He used to know Totski. But it is impossible that there should be any intimacy between them. She has not even been in the place--many people don\u2019t even know that she has returned from Moscow! I have only observed her carriage about for the last three days or so.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely carriage,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cYes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!\u201d The visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than before. But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince, from his own point of view. Admitting that he had his suspicions, from the moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that Nastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his suspicions and justified his fears.", " This was something new, for Gania had been wont to look upon Colia as a kind of errand-boy, treating him with contempt, threatening to \u201cpull his ears,\u201d and in general driving him almost wild with irritation. It seemed now that Gania really needed his brother, and the latter, for his part, felt as if he could forgive Gania much since he had returned the hundred thousand roubles offered to him by Nastasia Philipovna. Three months after the departure of the prince, the Ivolgin family discovered that Colia had made acquaintance with the Epanchins, and was on very friendly terms with the daughters. Varia heard of it first, though Colia had not asked her to introduce him. Little by little the family grew quite fond of him. Madame Epanchin at first looked on him with disdain, and received him coldly, but in a short time he grew to please her, because, as she said, he \u201cwas candid and no flatterer\u201d--a very true description. From the first he put himself on an equality with his new friends, and though he sometimes read newspapers and books to the mistress of the house, it was simply because he liked to be useful. One day, however, he and Lizabetha Prokofievna quarrelled seriously about the \u201cwoman question,\u201d in the course of a lively discussion on that burning subject. He told her that she was a tyrant, and that he would never set foot in her house again. It may seem incredible, but a day or two after, Madame Epanchin sent a servant with a note begging him to return, and Colia, without standing on his dignity, did so at once.", " It was said that when Gania entered the prince\u2019s room, he came with anything but friendly feelings, and in a condition of despair and misery; but that after a short conversation, he had stayed on for a couple of hours with him, sobbing continuously and bitterly the whole time. They had parted upon terms of cordial friendship. The Epanchins heard about this, as well as about the episode at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s. It was strange, perhaps, that the facts should become so quickly, and fairly accurately, known. As far as Gania was concerned, it might have been supposed that the news had come through Varvara Ardalionovna, who had suddenly become a frequent visitor of the Epanchin girls, greatly to their mother\u2019s surprise. But though Varvara had seen fit, for some reason, to make friends with them, it was not likely that she would have talked to them about her brother. She had plenty of pride, in spite of the fact that in thus acting she was seeking intimacy with people who had practically shown her brother the door. She and the Epanchin girls had been acquainted in childhood, although of late they had met but rarely. Even now Varvara hardly ever appeared in the drawing-room, but would slip in by a back way. Lizabetha Prokofievna, who disliked Varvara, although she had a great respect for her mother, was much annoyed by this sudden intimacy, and put it down to the general \u201ccontrariness\u201d of her daughters, who were \u201calways on the lookout for some new way of opposing her.\u201d Nevertheless, Varvara continued her visits."], "Where and at what time does Aglaya arrange the meeting with the Prince?": [" Both of them seemed very much astonished, not to say disturbed, at seeing me; they evidently had not expected the pleasure. Aglaya Ivanovna blushed up, and was actually a little confused. I don\u2019t know whether it was merely because I was there, or whether Gania\u2019s beauty was too much for her! But anyway, she turned crimson, and then finished up the business in a very funny manner. She jumped up from her seat, bowed back to Gania, smiled to Varia, and suddenly observed: \u2018I only came here to express my gratitude for all your kind wishes on my behalf, and to say that if I find I need your services, believe me--\u2019 Here she bowed them away, as it were, and they both marched off again, looking very foolish. Gania evidently could not make head nor tail of the matter, and turned as red as a lobster; but Varia understood at once that they must get away as quickly as they could, so she dragged Gania away; she is a great deal cleverer than he is. As for myself, I went there to arrange a meeting to be held between Aglaya Ivanovna and Nastasia Philipovna.\u201d \u201cNastasia Philipovna!\u201d cried the prince. \u201cAha! I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m glad that you are not above ordinary human feelings, for once. I\u2019ll console you a little now, after your consternation. See what I get for serving a young and high-souled maiden! This morning I received a slap in the face from the lady!\u201d \u201cA--a moral one?\u201d asked the prince, involuntarily.", " This agitated the old lady considerably; and she awoke her other daughters. Next, she learned from the maid that Aglaya had gone into the park before seven o\u2019clock. The sisters made a joke of Aglaya\u2019s last freak, and told their mother that if she went into the park to look for her, Aglaya would probably be very angry with her, and that she was pretty sure to be sitting reading on the green bench that she had talked of two or three days since, and about which she had nearly quarrelled with Prince S., who did not see anything particularly lovely in it. Arrived at the rendezvous of the prince and her daughter, and hearing the strange words of the latter, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been dreadfully alarmed, for many reasons. However, now that she had dragged the prince home with her, she began to feel a little frightened at what she had undertaken. Why should not Aglaya meet the prince in the park and have a talk with him, even if such a meeting should be by appointment? \u201cDon\u2019t suppose, prince,\u201d she began, bracing herself up for the effort, \u201cdon\u2019t suppose that I have brought you here to ask questions. After last night, I assure you, I am not so exceedingly anxious to see you at all; I could have postponed the pleasure for a long while.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut at the same time you would be very glad to know how I happened to meet Aglaya Ivanovna this morning?\u201d The prince finished her speech for her with the utmost composure.", " Woman understood woman! Aglaya shuddered. \u201cYou know of course why I requested this meeting?\u201d she said at last, quietly, and pausing twice in the delivery of this very short sentence. \u201cNo--I know nothing about it,\u201d said Nastasia, drily and abruptly. Aglaya blushed. Perhaps it struck her as very strange and impossible that she should really be sitting here and waiting for \u201cthat woman\u2019s\u201d reply to her question. At the first sound of Nastasia\u2019s voice a shudder ran through her frame. Of course \u201cthat woman\u201d observed and took in all this. \u201cYou know quite well, but you are pretending to be ignorant,\u201d said Aglaya, very low, with her eyes on the ground. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d asked Nastasia Philipovna, smiling slightly. \u201cYou want to take advantage of my position, now that I am in your house,\u201d continued Aglaya, awkwardly. \u201cFor that position _you_ are to blame and not I,\u201d said Nastasia, flaring up suddenly. \u201c_I_ did not invite _you_, but you me; and to this moment I am quite ignorant as to why I am thus honoured.\u201d Aglaya raised her head haughtily. \u201cRestrain your tongue!\u201d she said. \u201cI did not come here to fight you with your own weapons. \u201cOh! then you did come \u2018to fight,\u2019 I may conclude? Dear me!--and I thought you were cleverer--\u201d They looked at one another with undisguised malice. One of these women had written to the other, so lately, such letters as we have seen; and it all was dispersed at their first meeting.", " if it\u2019s improbable--it is--that\u2019s all! And yet--where should you have heard it? Though I must say, if a fly crosses the room it\u2019s known all over the place here. However, I\u2019ve warned you, and you may be grateful to me. Well--_au revoir_--probably in the next world! One more thing--don\u2019t think that I am telling you all this for your sake. Oh, dear, no! Do you know that I dedicated my confession to Aglaya Ivanovna? I did though, and how she took it, ha, ha! Oh, no! I am not acting from any high, exalted motives. But though I may have behaved like a cad to you, I have not done _her_ any harm. I don\u2019t apologize for my words about \u2018leavings\u2019 and all that. I am atoning for that, you see, by telling you the place and time of the meeting. Goodbye! You had better take your measures, if you are worthy the name of a man! The meeting is fixed for this evening--that\u2019s certain.\u201d Hippolyte walked towards the door, but the prince called him back and he stopped. \u201cThen you think Aglaya Ivanovna herself intends to go to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s tonight?\u201d he asked, and bright hectic spots came out on his cheeks and forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t know absolutely for certain; but in all probability it is so,\u201d replied Hippolyte, looking round. \u201cNastasia would hardly go to her; and they can\u2019t meet at Gania\u2019s, with a man nearly dead in the house.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s impossible, for that very reason,\u201d said the prince. \u201cHow would she get out if she wished to?"], "What does Aglaya send to Myshkin as a sign of peace?": [" Why didn\u2019t you send me a message? I would have come up and saved you this trouble.\u201d \u201cWell, well! Enough! You\u2019ve pitied me, and that\u2019s all that good manners exact. I forgot, how are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m all right; yesterday I was a little--\u201d \u201cI know, I heard; the china vase caught it! I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019ve come about something important. In the first place I had, the pleasure of seeing Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Aglaya Ivanovna enjoying a rendezvous on the green bench in the park. I was astonished to see what a fool a man can look. I remarked upon the fact to Aglaya Ivanovna when he had gone. I don\u2019t think anything ever surprises you, prince!\u201d added Hippolyte, gazing incredulously at the prince\u2019s calm demeanour. \u201cTo be astonished by nothing is a sign, they say, of a great intellect. In my opinion it would serve equally well as a sign of great foolishness. I am not hinting about you; pardon me! I am very unfortunate today in my expressions.\u201d \u201cI knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch--\u201d began the prince, and paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at his betraying no surprise. \u201cYou knew it? Come, that\u2019s news! But no--perhaps better not tell me. And were you a witness of the meeting?\u201d \u201cIf you were there yourself you must have known that I was _not_ there!\u201d \u201cOh! but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere. However, I am very glad, on your account, of course.", " You don\u2019t know the habits of that house--she _could_ not get away alone to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s! It\u2019s all nonsense!\u201d \u201cLook here, my dear prince, no one jumps out of the window if they can help it; but when there\u2019s a fire, the dandiest gentleman or the finest lady in the world will skip out! When the moment comes, and there\u2019s nothing else to be done--our young lady will go to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s! Don\u2019t they let the young ladies out of the house alone, then?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that exactly.\u201d \u201cIf you didn\u2019t mean that, then she has only to go down the steps and walk off, and she need never come back unless she chooses: Ships are burned behind one sometimes, and one doesn\u2019t care to return whence one came. Life need not consist only of lunches, and dinners, and Prince S\u2019s. It strikes me you take Aglaya Ivanovna for some conventional boarding-school girl. I said so to her, and she quite agreed with me. Wait till seven or eight o\u2019clock. In your place I would send someone there to keep watch, so as to seize the exact moment when she steps out of the house. Send Colia. He\u2019ll play the spy with pleasure--for you at least. Ha, ha, ha!\u201d Hippolyte went out. There was no reason for the prince to set anyone to watch, even if he had been capable of such a thing. Aglaya\u2019s command that he should stay at home all day seemed almost explained now. Perhaps she meant to call for him, herself, or it might be, of course, that she was anxious to make sure of his not coming there, and therefore bade him remain at home.", " General Epanchin only knew that there was a recitation of verses going on, and took no further interest in the matter. Of the rest of the audience, many had understood the allusion and wondered both at the daring of the lady and at the motive underlying it, but tried to show no sign of their feelings. But Evgenie Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager) both comprehended and tried his best to show that he comprehended; his smile was too mocking to leave any doubt on that point. \u201cHow beautiful that is!\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration. \u201cWhose is it?\u201d \u201cPushkin\u2019s, mama, of course! Don\u2019t disgrace us all by showing your ignorance,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cAs soon as we reach home give it to me to read.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house.\u201d \u201cThere are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying about from time immemorial,\u201d added Alexandra. \u201cSend Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy, then.--Aglaya, come here--kiss me, dear, you recited beautifully! but,\u201d she added in a whisper, \u201cif you were sincere I am sorry for you. If it was a joke, I do not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do it, and in any case you would have done far better not to recite it at all. Do you understand?--Now come along, young woman; we\u2019ve sat here too long. I\u2019ll speak to you about this another time.\u201d Meanwhile the prince took the opportunity of greeting General Epanchin, and the general introduced Evgenie Pavlovitch to him.", " He found the mother and daughter locked in one another\u2019s arms, mingling their tears. These were the tears of joy and peace and reconciliation. Aglaya was kissing her mother\u2019s lips and cheeks and hands; they were hugging each other in the most ardent way. \u201cThere, look at her now--Ivan Fedorovitch! Here she is--all of her! This is our _real_ Aglaya at last!\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna. Aglaya raised her happy, tearful face from her mother\u2019s breast, glanced at her father, and burst out laughing. She sprang at him and hugged him too, and kissed him over and over again. She then rushed back to her mother and hid her face in the maternal bosom, and there indulged in more tears. Her mother covered her with a corner of her shawl. \u201cOh, you cruel little girl! How will you treat us all next, I wonder?\u201d she said, but she spoke with a ring of joy in her voice, and as though she breathed at last without the oppression which she had felt so long. \u201cCruel?\u201d sobbed Aglaya. \u201cYes, I _am_ cruel, and worthless, and spoiled--tell father so,--oh, here he is--I forgot Father, listen!\u201d She laughed through her tears. \u201cMy darling, my little idol,\u201d cried the general, kissing and fondling her hands (Aglaya did not draw them away); \u201cso you love this young man, do you?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no, can\u2019t _bear_ him, I can\u2019t _bear_ your young man!\u201d cried Aglaya, raising her head. \u201cAnd if you dare say that _once_ more, papa--I\u2019m serious, you know, I\u2019m,--do you hear me--I\u2019m serious!\u201d She certainly did seem to be serious enough."], "What does Prince Myshkin break at the dinner party at the Yepanchins'?": [" But how about the prince, now--look how he is blushing!\u201d \u201cI think you are partially right, but you exaggerate,\u201d said the prince, who had certainly blushed up, of a sudden, for some reason or other. \u201cFerdishenko--either tell us your story, or be quiet, and mind your own business. You exhaust all patience,\u201d cuttingly and irritably remarked Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cImmediately, immediately! As for my story, gentlemen, it is too stupid and absurd to tell you. \u201cI assure you I am not a thief, and yet I have stolen; I cannot explain why. It was at Semeon Ivanovitch Ishenka\u2019s country house, one Sunday. He had a dinner party. After dinner the men stayed at the table over their wine. It struck me to ask the daughter of the house to play something on the piano; so I passed through the corner room to join the ladies. In that room, on Maria Ivanovna\u2019s writing-table, I observed a three-rouble note. She must have taken it out for some purpose, and left it lying there. There was no one about. I took up the note and put it in my pocket; why, I can\u2019t say. I don\u2019t know what possessed me to do it, but it was done, and I went quickly back to the dining-room and reseated myself at the dinner-table. I sat and waited there in a great state of excitement. I talked hard, and told lots of stories, and laughed like mad; then I joined the ladies. \u201cIn half an hour or so the loss was discovered, and the servants were being put under examination.", " She did not seem to be joking in the slightest degree. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve put me into such a fright that I shall certainly make a fool of myself, and very likely break something too. I wasn\u2019t a bit alarmed before, but now I\u2019m as nervous as can be.\u201d \u201cThen don\u2019t speak at all. Sit still and don\u2019t talk.\u201d \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do that, you know! I shall say something foolish out of pure \u2018funk,\u2019 and break something for the same excellent reason; I know I shall. Perhaps I shall slip and fall on the slippery floor; I\u2019ve done that before now, you know. I shall dream of it all night now. Why did you say anything about it?\u201d Aglaya looked blackly at him. \u201cDo you know what, I had better not come at all tomorrow! I\u2019ll plead sick-list and stay away,\u201d said the prince, with decision. Aglaya stamped her foot, and grew quite pale with anger. \u201cOh, my goodness! Just listen to that! \u2018Better not come,\u2019 when the party is on purpose for him! Good Lord! What a delightful thing it is to have to do with such a--such a stupid as you are!\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll come, I\u2019ll come,\u201d interrupted the prince, hastily, \u201cand I\u2019ll give you my word of honour that I will sit the whole evening and not say a word.\u201d \u201cI believe that\u2019s the best thing you can do. You said you\u2019d \u2018plead sick-list\u2019 just now; where in the world do you get hold of such expressions? Why do you talk to me like this? Are you trying to irritate me, or what?\u201d \u201cForgive me, it\u2019s a schoolboy expression.", " In vain the girls assured her that a man who had not written for six months would not be in such a dreadful hurry, and that probably he had enough to do in town without needing to bustle down to Pavlofsk to see them. Their mother was quite angry at the very idea of such a thing, and announced her absolute conviction that he would turn up the next day at latest. So next day the prince was expected all the morning, and at dinner, tea, and supper; and when he did not appear in the evening, Mrs. Epanchin quarrelled with everyone in the house, finding plenty of pretexts without so much as mentioning the prince\u2019s name. On the third day there was no talk of him at all, until Aglaya remarked at dinner: \u201cMamma is cross because the prince hasn\u2019t turned up,\u201d to which the general replied that it was not his fault. Mrs. Epanchin misunderstood the observation, and rising from her place she left the room in majestic wrath. In the evening, however, Colia came with the story of the prince\u2019s adventures, so far as he knew them. Mrs. Epanchin was triumphant; although Colia had to listen to a long lecture. \u201cHe idles about here the whole day long, one can\u2019t get rid of him; and then when he is wanted he does not come. He might have sent a line if he did not wish to inconvenience himself.\u201d At the words \u201cone can\u2019t get rid of him,\u201d Colia was very angry, and nearly flew into a rage; but he resolved to be quiet for the time and show his resentment later.", " This question he did not once ask himself today; his heart was quite pure. He knew whom he loved. He was not so much afraid of this meeting, nor of its strangeness, nor of any reasons there might be for it, unknown to himself; he was afraid of the woman herself, Nastasia Philipovna. He remembered, some days afterwards, how during all those fevered hours he had seen but _her_ eyes, _her_ look, had heard _her_ voice, strange words of hers; he remembered that this was so, although he could not recollect the details of his thoughts. He could remember that Vera brought him some dinner, and that he took it; but whether he slept after dinner, or no, he could not recollect. He only knew that he began to distinguish things clearly from the moment when Aglaya suddenly appeared, and he jumped up from the sofa and went to meet her. It was just a quarter past seven then. Aglaya was quite alone, and dressed, apparently hastily, in a light mantle. Her face was pale, as it had been in the morning, and her eyes were ablaze with bright but subdued fire. He had never seen that expression in her eyes before. She gazed attentively at him. \u201cYou are quite ready, I observe,\u201d she said, with absolute composure, \u201cdressed, and your hat in your hand. I see somebody has thought fit to warn you, and I know who. Hippolyte?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me,\u201d said the prince, feeling only half alive. \u201cCome then. You know, I suppose, that you must escort me there?"], "What prompts Aglaya to run away from the meeting with Nastassya Filippovna?": [" The prince muttered something, blushed, and jumped up; but Aglaya immediately sat down beside him; so he reseated himself. She looked suddenly, but attentively into his face, then at the window, as though thinking of something else, and then again at him. \u201cPerhaps she wants to laugh at me,\u201d thought the prince, \u201cbut no; for if she did she certainly would do so.\u201d \u201cWould you like some tea? I\u2019ll order some,\u201d she said, after a minute or two of silence. \u201cN-no thanks, I don\u2019t know--\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know! How can you not know? By-the-by, look here--if someone were to challenge you to a duel, what should you do? I wished to ask you this--some time ago--\u201d \u201cWhy? Nobody would ever challenge me to a duel!\u201d \u201cBut if they were to, would you be dreadfully frightened?\u201d \u201cI dare say I should be--much alarmed!\u201d \u201cSeriously? Then are you a coward?\u201d \u201cN-no!--I don\u2019t think so. A coward is a man who is afraid and runs away; the man who is frightened but does not run away, is not quite a coward,\u201d said the prince with a smile, after a moment\u2019s thought. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t run away?\u201d \u201cNo--I don\u2019t think I should run away,\u201d replied the prince, laughing outright at last at Aglaya\u2019s questions. \u201cThough I am a woman, I should certainly not run away for anything,\u201d said Aglaya, in a slightly pained voice. \u201cHowever, I see you are laughing at me and twisting your face up as usual in order to make yourself look more interesting.", " I don\u2019t want to go to their balls and things--I want to do good. I have long desired to run away, for I have been kept shut up for twenty years, and they are always trying to marry me off. I wanted to run away when I was fourteen years old--I was a little fool then, I know--but now I have worked it all out, and I have waited for you to tell me about foreign countries. I have never seen a single Gothic cathedral. I must go to Rome; I must see all the museums; I must study in Paris. All this last year I have been preparing and reading forbidden books. Alexandra and Adelaida are allowed to read anything they like, but I mayn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to quarrel with my sisters, but I told my parents long ago that I wish to change my social position. I have decided to take up teaching, and I count on you because you said you loved children. Can we go in for education together--if not at once, then afterwards? We could do good together. I won\u2019t be a general\u2019s daughter any more! Tell me, are you a very learned man?\u201d \u201cOh no; not at all.\u201d \u201cOh-h-h! I\u2019m sorry for that. I thought you were. I wonder why I always thought so--but at all events you\u2019ll help me, won\u2019t you? Because I\u2019ve chosen you, you know.\u201d \u201cAglaya Ivanovna, it\u2019s absurd.\u201d \u201cBut I will, I _will_ run away!\u201d she cried--and her eyes flashed again with anger--\u201cand if you don\u2019t agree I shall go and marry Gavrila Ardalionovitch! I won\u2019t be considered a horrible girl, and accused of goodness knows what.\u201d \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d cried the prince, almost starting from his seat.", " \u201cYou respect her very much, don\u2019t you?\u201d she added, quite unconscious of the naiveness of the question. \u201c_Very_ much; and I am so glad that you have realized the fact.\u201d \u201cI am very glad, too, because she is often laughed at by people. But listen to the chief point. I have long thought over the matter, and at last I have chosen you. I don\u2019t wish people to laugh at me; I don\u2019t wish people to think me a \u2018little fool.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be chaffed. I felt all this of a sudden, and I refused Evgenie Pavlovitch flatly, because I am not going to be forever thrown at people\u2019s heads to be married. I want--I want--well, I\u2019ll tell you, I wish to run away from home, and I have chosen you to help me.\u201d \u201cRun away from home?\u201d cried the prince. \u201cYes--yes--yes! Run away from home!\u201d she repeated, in a transport of rage. \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t be made to blush every minute by them all! I don\u2019t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or anyone, and therefore I have chosen you. I shall tell you everything, _everything_, even the most important things of all, whenever I like, and you are to hide nothing from me on your side. I want to speak to at least one person, as I would to myself. They have suddenly begun to say that I am waiting for you, and in love with you. They began this before you arrived here, and so I didn\u2019t show them the letter, and now they all say it, every one of them. I want to be brave, and be afraid of nobody.", " They do say that you are a--you know what! She loves another--there, you can understand that much! Just as I love her, exactly so she loves another man. And that other man is--do you know who? It\u2019s you. There--you didn\u2019t know that, eh?\u201d \u201cI?\u201d \u201cYou, you! She has loved you ever since that day, her birthday! Only she thinks she cannot marry you, because it would be the ruin of you. \u2018Everybody knows what sort of a woman I am,\u2019 she says. She told me all this herself, to my very face! She\u2019s afraid of disgracing and ruining you, she says, but it doesn\u2019t matter about me. She can marry me all right! Notice how much consideration she shows for me!\u201d \u201cBut why did she run away to me, and then again from me to--\u201d \u201cFrom you to me? Ha, ha! that\u2019s nothing! Why, she always acts as though she were in a delirium now-a-days! Either she says, \u2018Come on, I\u2019ll marry you! Let\u2019s have the wedding quickly!\u2019 and fixes the day, and seems in a hurry for it, and when it begins to come near she feels frightened; or else some other idea gets into her head--goodness knows! you\u2019ve seen her--you know how she goes on--laughing and crying and raving! There\u2019s nothing extraordinary about her having run away from you! She ran away because she found out how dearly she loved you. She could not bear to be near you. You said just now that I had found her at Moscow, when she ran away from you. I didn\u2019t do anything of the sort; she came to me herself, straight from you."], "Where does Myshkin spend the night after following Rogozhin and Nastassya Filippovna to St. Petersburg?": [" He was very deeply mortified. II. It was the beginning of June, and for a whole week the weather in St. Petersburg had been magnificent. The Epanchins had a luxurious country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the family had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide him. It must have been a hallucination. But the disagreeable impression remained, and without this, the prince was sad and thoughtful already, and seemed to be much preoccupied. His cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya. Here he engaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished. He washed and changed, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to waste no time. Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he left Petersburg would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his exterior was concerned. His clothes certainly were very different; they were more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to mockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance.", " I felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have been tempted to cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was my best justification. Such a woman could make anyone forget all reason--everything! Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her a hundred thousand roubles! Of course, all that happened tonight was ephemeral, fantastic, unseemly--yet it lacked neither colour nor originality. My God! What might not have been made of such a character combined with such beauty! Yet in spite of all efforts--in spite of all education, even--all those gifts are wasted! She is an uncut diamond.... I have often said so.\u201d And Afanasy Ivanovitch heaved a deep sigh. PART II I. Two days after the strange conclusion to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s birthday party, with the record of which we concluded the first part of this story, Prince Muishkin hurriedly left St. Petersburg for Moscow, in order to see after some business connected with the receipt of his unexpected fortune. It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little information. The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about him all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last.", " \u201cHe told me I had been a brother to him,\u201d thought the prince. \u201cHe said so today, for the first time.\u201d He was sitting in the Summer Garden on a seat under a tree, and his mind dwelt on the matter. It was about seven o\u2019clock, and the place was empty. The stifling atmosphere foretold a storm, and the prince felt a certain charm in the contemplative mood which possessed him. He found pleasure, too, in gazing at the exterior objects around him. All the time he was trying to forget some thing, to escape from some idea that haunted him; but melancholy thoughts came back, though he would so willingly have escaped from them. He remembered suddenly how he had been talking to the waiter, while he dined, about a recently committed murder which the whole town was discussing, and as he thought of it something strange came over him. He was seized all at once by a violent desire, almost a temptation, against which he strove in vain. He jumped up and walked off as fast as he could towards the \u201cPetersburg Side.\u201d [One of the quarters of St. Petersburg.] He had asked someone, a little while before, to show him which was the Petersburg Side, on the banks of the Neva. He had not gone there, however; and he knew very well that it was of no use to go now, for he would certainly not find Lebedeff\u2019s relation at home. He had the address, but she must certainly have gone to Pavlofsk, or Colia would have let him know.", " Varia, however, informed the girls of what had happened, she having received the news from Ptitsin, who generally knew more than most people. To make an end, we may say that there were many changes in the Epanchin household in the spring, so that it was not difficult to forget the prince, who sent no news of himself. The Epanchin family had at last made up their minds to spend the summer abroad, all except the general, who could not waste time in \u201ctravelling for enjoyment,\u201d of course. This arrangement was brought about by the persistence of the girls, who insisted that they were never allowed to go abroad because their parents were too anxious to marry them off. Perhaps their parents had at last come to the conclusion that husbands might be found abroad, and that a summer\u2019s travel might bear fruit. The marriage between Alexandra and Totski had been broken off. Since the prince\u2019s departure from St. Petersburg no more had been said about it; the subject had been dropped without ceremony, much to the joy of Mrs. General, who, announced that she was \u201cready to cross herself with both hands\u201d in gratitude for the escape. The general, however, regretted Totski for a long while. \u201cSuch a fortune!\u201d he sighed, \u201cand such a good, easy-going fellow!\u201d After a time it became known that Totski had married a French marquise, and was to be carried off by her to Paris, and then to Brittany. \u201cOh, well,\u201d thought the general, \u201che\u2019s lost to us for good, now.\u201d So the Epanchins prepared to depart for the summer."], "Who visits the Prince in Switzerland?": [" The prince hardly knew anything, for this was the first informant from the household whom he had met since the estrangement. Evgenie reported that Aglaya had been really ill, and that for two nights she had not slept at all, owing to high fever; that now she was better and out of serious danger, but still in a nervous, hysterical state. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that there is peace in the house, at all events,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey never utter a hint about the past, not only in Aglaya\u2019s presence, but even among themselves. The old people are talking of a trip abroad in the autumn, immediately after Adelaida\u2019s wedding; Aglaya received the news in silence.\u201d Evgenie himself was very likely going abroad also; so were Prince S. and his wife, if affairs allowed of it; the general was to stay at home. They were all at their estate of Colmina now, about twenty miles or so from St. Petersburg. Princess Bielokonski had not returned to Moscow yet, and was apparently staying on for reasons of her own. Lizabetha Prokofievna had insisted that it was quite impossible to remain in Pavlofsk after what had happened. Evgenie had told her of all the rumours current in town about the affair; so that there could be no talk of their going to their house on the Yelagin as yet. \u201cAnd in point of fact, prince,\u201d added Evgenie Pavlovitch, \u201cyou must allow that they could hardly have stayed here, considering that they knew of all that went on at your place, and in the face of your daily visits to their house, visits which you insisted upon making in spite of their refusal to see you.\u201d \u201cYes--yes, quite so; you are quite right.", " To him he made over all that he knew as to the events above recorded, and as to the present condition of the prince. He was not far wrong in his choice. Evgenie Pavlovitch took the deepest interest in the fate of the unfortunate \u201cidiot,\u201d and, thanks to his influence, the prince found himself once more with Dr. Schneider, in Switzerland. Evgenie Pavlovitch, who went abroad at this time, intending to live a long while on the continent, being, as he often said, quite superfluous in Russia, visits his sick friend at Schneider\u2019s every few months. But Dr. Schneider frowns ever more and more and shakes his head; he hints that the brain is fatally injured; he does not as yet declare that his patient is incurable, but he allows himself to express the gravest fears. Evgenie takes this much to heart, and he has a heart, as is proved by the fact that he receives and even answers letters from Colia. But besides this, another trait in his character has become apparent, and as it is a good trait we will make haste to reveal it. After each visit to Schneider\u2019s establishment, Evgenie Pavlovitch writes another letter, besides that to Colia, giving the most minute particulars concerning the invalid\u2019s condition. In these letters is to be detected, and in each one more than the last, a growing feeling of friendship and sympathy. The individual who corresponds thus with Evgenie Pavlovitch, and who engages so much of his attention and respect, is Vera Lebedeff.", " Lebedeff had been much struck by this point of view, and he terminated his confession by assuring the prince that he was ready, if need be, to shed his very life\u2019s blood for him. Hippolyte, too, was a source of some distraction to the prince at this time; he would send for him at any and every hour of the day. They lived,--Hippolyte and his mother and the children,--in a small house not far off, and the little ones were happy, if only because they were able to escape from the invalid into the garden. The prince had enough to do in keeping the peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother, and eventually the former became so malicious and sarcastic on the subject of the approaching wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last, and refused to continue his visits. A couple of days later, however, Hippolyte\u2019s mother came with tears in her eyes, and begged the prince to come back, \u201cor _he_ would eat her up bodily.\u201d She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose. Of course the prince went. There was no secret, however, unless we reckon certain pantings and agitated glances around (probably all put on) as the invalid begged his visitor to \u201cbeware of Rogojin.\u201d \u201cHe is the sort of man,\u201d he continued, \u201cwho won\u2019t give up his object, you know; he is not like you and me, prince--he belongs to quite a different order of beings. If he sets his heart on a thing he won\u2019t be afraid of anything--\u201d and so on.", " \u201cThat is a thing I cannot undertake to explain,\u201d replied the prince. Gania looked at him with angry contempt. \u201cOh! I suppose the present she wished to make to you, when she took you into the dining-room, was her confidence, eh?\u201d \u201cI suppose that was it; I cannot explain it otherwise.\u201d \u201cBut why, _why?_ Devil take it, what did you do in there? Why did they fancy you? Look here, can\u2019t you remember exactly what you said to them, from the very beginning? Can\u2019t you remember?\u201d \u201cOh, we talked of a great many things. When first I went in we began to speak of Switzerland.\u201d \u201cOh, the devil take Switzerland!\u201d \u201cThen about executions.\u201d \u201cExecutions?\u201d \u201cYes--at least about one. Then I told the whole three years\u2019 story of my life, and the history of a poor peasant girl--\u201d \u201cOh, damn the peasant girl! go on, go on!\u201d said Gania, impatiently. \u201cThen how Schneider told me about my childish nature, and--\u201d \u201cOh, _curse_ Schneider and his dirty opinions! Go on.\u201d \u201cThen I began to talk about faces, at least about the _expressions_ of faces, and said that Aglaya Ivanovna was nearly as lovely as Nastasia Philipovna. It was then I blurted out about the portrait--\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t repeat what you heard in the study? You didn\u2019t repeat that--eh?\u201d \u201cNo, I tell you I did _not_.\u201d \u201cThen how did they--look here! Did Aglaya show my letter to the old lady?\u201d \u201cOh, there I can give you my fullest assurance that she did _not_."]}
