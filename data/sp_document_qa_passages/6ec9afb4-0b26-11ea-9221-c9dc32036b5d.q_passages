{"Why does Tess take the job at the d\u2019Urberville estate?": [" Round about were deparked hills and slopes\u2014now cut up into little paddocks\u2014and the green foundations that showed where the d\u2019Urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate. Hard by, the aisle of the church called the d\u2019Urberville Aisle looked on imperturbably. \u201cIsn\u2019t your family vault your own freehold?\u201d said Tess\u2019s mother, as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. \u201cWhy, of course \u2019tis, and that\u2019s where we will camp, girls, till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof! Now, Tess and \u2019Liza and Abraham, you help me. We\u2019ll make a nest for these children, and then we\u2019ll have another look round.\u201d Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building known as the d\u2019Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay.", " Tess, who mused on the christening a good deal, wondered if it were doctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child. Nobody could tell this but the parson of the parish, and he was a new-comer, and did not know her. She went to his house after dusk, and stood by the gate, but could not summon courage to go in. The enterprise would have been abandoned if she had not by accident met him coming homeward as she turned away. In the gloom she did not mind speaking freely. \u201cI should like to ask you something, sir.\u201d He expressed his willingness to listen, and she told the story of the baby\u2019s illness and the extemporized ordinance. \u201cAnd now, sir,\u201d she added earnestly, \u201ccan you tell me this\u2014will it be just the same for him as if you had baptized him?\u201d Having the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he should have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his customers among themselves, he was disposed to say no.", " He wondered a little that she did not enter into these frivolities with his own zest. Looking at her silently for a long time; \u201cShe is a dear dear Tess,\u201d he thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of a difficult passage. \u201cDo I realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune? I think not. I think I could not, unless I were a woman myself. What I am in worldly estate, she is. What I become, she must become. What I cannot be, she cannot be. And shall I ever neglect her, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her? God forbid such a crime!\u201d They sat on over the tea-table waiting for their luggage, which the dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark. But evening began to close in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought nothing more than they stood in. With the departure of the sun the calm mood of the winter day changed.", " Well, Mr Clare found this out, and spoke quite scornful to the poor girl for days. \u2018Ah!\u2019 he says to her, \u2018you\u2019ll never make a good dairymaid! All your skill was used up ages ago in Palestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength for more deeds!\u2019 A boy came here t\u2019other day asking for a job, and said his name was Matt, and when we asked him his surname he said he\u2019d never heard that \u2019a had any surname, and when we asked why, he said he supposed his folks hadn\u2019t been \u2019stablished long enough. \u2018Ah! you\u2019re the very boy I want!\u2019 says Mr Clare, jumping up and shaking hands wi\u2019en; \u2018I\u2019ve great hopes of you;\u2019 and gave him half-a-crown. O no! he can\u2019t stomach old families!\u201d After hearing this caricature of Clare\u2019s opinion poor Tess was glad that she had not said a word in a weak moment about her family\u2014even though it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle and become a new one."], "What does Tess name her son?": [" Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name, Clare said\u2014 \u201cOf a Miss Durbeyfield?\u201d \u201cDurbeyfield?\u201d This also was strange to the postman addressed. \u201cThere\u2019s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cand without the name of the house \u2019tis impossible to find \u2019em.\u201d One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated to him. \u201cI know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d\u2019Urberville at The Herons,\u201d said the second. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation. \u201cWhat place is The Herons?\u201d \u201cA stylish lodging-house. \u2019Tis all lodging-houses here, bless \u2019ee.\u201d Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither, arriving with the milkman. The Herons, though an ordinary villa, stood in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place in which one would have expected to find lodgings, so private was its appearance.", " The most impressed of them said: \u201cBe you really going to christen him, Tess?\u201d The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name going to be?\u201d She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service, and now she pronounced it: \u201cSORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d She sprinkled the water, and there was silence. \u201cSay \u2018Amen,\u2019 children.\u201d The tiny voices piped in obedient response, \u201cAmen!\u201d Tess went on: \u201cWe receive this child\u201d\u2014and so forth\u2014\u201cand do sign him with the sign of the Cross.\u201d Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life\u2019s end.", " But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you, Tess (he laughed as he spoke), and made selfish likewise. For your own sake I rejoice in your descent. Society is hopelessly snobbish, and this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its acceptance of you as my wife, after I have made you the well-read woman that I mean to make you. My mother too, poor soul, will think so much better of you on account of it. Tess, you must spell your name correctly\u2014d\u2019Urberville\u2014from this very day.\u201d \u201cI like the other way rather best.\u201d \u201cBut you _must_, dearest! Good heavens, why dozens of mushroom millionaires would jump at such a possession! By the bye, there\u2019s one of that kidney who has taken the name\u2014where have I heard of him?\u2014Up in the neighbourhood of The Chase, I think. Why, he is the very man who had that rumpus with my father I told you of. What an odd coincidence!\u201d \u201cAngel, I think I would rather not take the name!", " If poor Tess was a servant here, as he feared, she would go to the back-door to that milkman, and he was inclined to go thither also. However, in his doubts he turned to the front, and rang. The hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door. Clare inquired for Teresa d\u2019Urberville or Durbeyfield. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though she had not adopted his name. \u201cWill you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?\u201d \u201cIt is rather early. What name shall I give, sir?\u201d \u201cAngel.\u201d \u201cMr Angel?\u201d \u201cNo; Angel. It is my Christian name. She\u2019ll understand.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see if she is awake.\u201d He was shown into the front room\u2014the dining-room\u2014and looked out through the spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons and other shrubs upon it. Obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had feared, and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it."], "Who is giving the barn sermon that Tess stops in to hear?": [" Nearing the central part, her echoes were intruded on by other sounds; and seeing the barn not far off the road, she guessed these to be the utterances of the preacher. His voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could soon catch his sentences, though she was on the closed side of the barn. The sermon, as might be expected, was of the extremest antinomian type; on justification by faith, as expounded in the theology of St Paul. This fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered with animated enthusiasm, in a manner entirely declamatory, for he had plainly no skill as a dialectician. Although Tess had not heard the beginning of the address, she learnt what the text had been from its constant iteration\u2014 \u201cO foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?\u201d Tess was all the more interested, as she stood listening behind, in finding that the preacher\u2019s doctrine was a vehement form of the view of Angel\u2019s father, and her interest intensified when the speaker began to detail his own spiritual experiences of how he had come by those views.", " They\u2019d make ye wriggle! Not but what this is a very good tex for rural districts.... Ah\u2014there\u2019s a nice bit of blank wall up by that barn standing to waste. I must put one there\u2014one that it will be good for dangerous young females like yerself to heed. Will ye wait, missy?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said she; and taking her basket Tess trudged on. A little way forward she turned her head. The old gray wall began to advertise a similar fiery lettering to the first, with a strange and unwonted mien, as if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon to perform. It was with a sudden flush that she read and realized what was to be the inscription he was now halfway through\u2014 THOU, SHALT, NOT, COMMIT\u2014 Her cheerful friend saw her looking, stopped his brush, and shouted\u2014 \u201cIf you want to ask for edification on these things of moment, there\u2019s a very earnest good man going to preach a charity-sermon to-day in the parish you are going to\u2014Mr Clare of Emminster.", " She did not enter any house till, at the seventh or eighth mile, she descended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet of Evershead, where in the morning she had breakfasted with such contrasting expectations. The cottage by the church, in which she again sat down, was almost the first at that end of the village, and while the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry, Tess, looking down the street, perceived that the place seemed quite deserted. \u201cThe people are gone to afternoon service, I suppose?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, my dear,\u201d said the old woman. \u201c\u2019Tis too soon for that; the bells hain\u2019t strook out yet. They be all gone to hear the preaching in yonder barn. A ranter preaches there between the services\u2014an excellent, fiery, Christian man, they say. But, Lord, I don\u2019t go to hear\u2019n! What comes in the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough for I.\u201d Tess soon went onward into the village, her footsteps echoing against the houses as though it were a place of the dead.", " \u201cIt wants harder flesh than yours for this work.\u201d Just then the farmer entered. \u201cOh, that\u2019s how you get on when I am away,\u201d he said to her. \u201cBut it is my own loss,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cNot yours.\u201d \u201cI want it finished,\u201d he said doggedly, as he crossed the barn and went out at the other door. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2019ee mind him, there\u2019s a dear,\u201d said Marian. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here before. Now you go and lie down there, and Izz and I will make up your number.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like to let you do that. I\u2019m taller than you, too.\u201d However, she was so overcome that she consented to lie down awhile, and reclined on a heap of pull-tails\u2014the refuse after the straight straw had been drawn\u2014thrown up at the further side of the barn. Her succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the re-opening the subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work. She lay in a state of percipience without volition, and the rustle of the straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of bodily touches."], "Who offers financial help after Tess\u2019s father dies?": [" His father then told him that, as he had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel himself unduly slighted. \u201cAs far as worldly wealth goes,\u201d continued his father, \u201cyou will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.\u201d This considerateness on old Mr Clare\u2019s part led Angel onward to the other and dearer subject. He observed to his father that he was then six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matters\u2014some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield. Would it not be well, therefore, for him to marry? His father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel put the question\u2014 \u201cWhat kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hard-working farmer?\u201d \u201cA truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goings-out and your comings-in.", " Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; she wondered if he had gone back to her father\u2019s house; and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards. Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters. \u201cO, Tessy\u2014what do you think! \u2019Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there\u2019s a lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think father is dead!\u201d The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till, beholding the effect produced upon her, she said\u2014 \u201cWhat, Tess, shan\u2019t we talk to father never no more?\u201d \u201cBut father was only a little bit ill!\u201d exclaimed Tess distractedly. \u2019Liza-Lu came up. \u201cHe dropped down just now, and the doctor who was there for mother said there was no chance for him, because his heart was growed in.\u201d Yes; the Durbeyfield couple had changed places; the dying one was out of danger, and the indisposed one was dead.", " You must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some help in our trouble.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care to do that,\u201d says Tess. \u201cIf there is such a lady, \u2019twould be enough for us if she were friendly\u2014not to expect her to give us help.\u201d \u201cYou could win her round to do anything, my dear. Besides, perhaps there\u2019s more in it than you know of. I\u2019ve heard what I\u2019ve heard, good-now.\u201d The oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish; but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful profit. Her mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered that this Mrs d\u2019Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity. But Tess\u2019s pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her. \u201cI\u2019d rather try to get work,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDurbeyfield, you can settle it,\u201d said his wife, turning to where he sat in the background.", " Though she tried not to shed tears, she could not help showing one or two. \u201cI did not mean it!\u201d said he, sorry. \u201cYou are worried at not having your things, I know. I cannot think why old Jonathan has not come with them. Why, it is seven o\u2019clock? Ah, there he is!\u201d A knock had come to the door, and, there being nobody else to answer it, Clare went out. He returned to the room with a small package in his hand. \u201cIt is not Jonathan, after all,\u201d he said. \u201cHow vexing!\u201d said Tess. The packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived at Talbothays from Emminster Vicarage immediately after the departure of the married couple, and had followed them hither, being under injunction to deliver it into nobody\u2019s hands but theirs. Clare brought it to the light. It was less than a foot long, sewed up in canvas, sealed in red wax with his father\u2019s seal, and directed in his father\u2019s hand to \u201cMrs Angel Clare.\u201d \u201cIt is a little wedding-present for you, Tess,\u201d said he, handing it to her."], "When Angel returns, how does Tess ultimately leave Alec?": [" \u201cAnd so, my pretty girl, you\u2019ve come on a friendly visit to us, as relations?\u201d \u201cI suppose I have,\u201d faltered Tess, looking uncomfortable again. \u201cWell\u2014there\u2019s no harm in it. Where do you live? What are you?\u201d She gave him brief particulars; and responding to further inquiries told him that she was intending to go back by the same carrier who had brought her. \u201cIt is a long while before he returns past Trantridge Cross. Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?\u201d Tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young man was pressing, and she consented to accompany him. He conducted her about the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence to the fruit-garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked strawberries. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess, \u201cwhen they come.\u201d \u201cThey are already here.\u201d D\u2019Urberville began gathering specimens of the fruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and, presently, selecting a specially fine product of the \u201cBritish Queen\u201d variety, he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth.", " I would flatly refuse, if I were you.\u201d \u201cBut she wants me particularly to do it, and to be ready by to-morrow morning.\u201d \u201cDoes she? Well then\u2014I\u2019ll give you a lesson or two.\u201d \u201cOh no, you won\u2019t!\u201d said Tess, withdrawing towards the door. \u201cNonsense; I don\u2019t want to touch you. See\u2014I\u2019ll stand on this side of the wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so you may feel quite safe. Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly. There \u2019tis\u2014so.\u201d He suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of \u201cTake, O take those lips away.\u201d But the allusion was lost upon Tess. \u201cNow try,\u201d said d\u2019Urberville. She attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural severity. But he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of him, she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note; laughing distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that she had laughed. He encouraged her with \u201cTry again!\u201d Tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she tried\u2014ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound.", " Tess uttered a short little \u201cOh!\u201d And a moment after she said, quickly, \u201cI shall eat my dinner here\u2014right on the rick.\u201d Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack. The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d\u2019Urberville, the late Evangelist, despite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack\u2014now an oblong and level platform of sheaves.", " But the more Tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she to take it. The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be called, on Clare\u2019s account, which had led her to hide from her own parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her owning to his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her. They probably despised her already; how much more they would despise her in the character of a mendicant! The consequence was that by no effort could the parson\u2019s daughter-in-law bring herself to let him know her state. Her reluctance to communicate with her husband\u2019s parents might, she thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her own the reverse obtained. On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately going to join her husband; and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return in comfort, hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result in a short stay only, after which he would come to fetch her, or that he would write for her to join him; in any case that they would soon present a united front to their families and the world."], "When John Durbeyfield learns that he is descended from a noble line, what is he quick to attempt to do with the information?": [" Her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents? She reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the village. It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who had kept it for many years, and to whom she had been known; he had probably left on New Year\u2019s Day, the date when such changes were made. Having received no intelligence lately from her home, she asked the turnpike-keeper for news. \u201cOh\u2014nothing, miss,\u201d he answered. \u201cMarlott is Marlott still. Folks have died and that. John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter married this week to a gentleman-farmer; not from John\u2019s own house, you know; they was married elsewhere; the gentleman being of that high standing that John\u2019s own folk was not considered well-be-doing enough to have any part in it, the bridegroom seeming not to know how\u2019t have been discovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood, with family skillentons in their own vaults to this day, but done out of his property in the time o\u2019 the Romans.", " When he was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie, and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside, depositing his basket before him. In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance, walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by Durbeyfield. The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad quickened his pace and came near. \u201cBoy, take up that basket! I want \u2019ee to go on an errand for me.\u201d The lath-like stripling frowned. \u201cWho be you, then, John Durbeyfield, to order me about and call me \u2018boy\u2019? You know my name as well as I know yours!\u201d \u201cDo you, do you? That\u2019s the secret\u2014that\u2019s the secret! Now obey my orders, and take the message I\u2019m going to charge \u2019ee wi\u2019... Well, Fred, I don\u2019t mind telling you that the secret is that I\u2019m one of a noble race\u2014it has been just found out by me this present afternoon, p.m.\u201d And as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from his sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies.", " \u201cPerhaps to show his diamond ring,\u201d murmured Sir John, dreamily, from his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll think it over,\u201d said Tess, leaving the room. \u201cWell, she\u2019s made a conquest o\u2019 the younger branch of us, straight off,\u201d continued the matron to her husband, \u201cand she\u2019s a fool if she don\u2019t follow it up.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t quite like my children going away from home,\u201d said the haggler. \u201cAs the head of the family, the rest ought to come to me.\u201d \u201cBut do let her go, Jacky,\u201d coaxed his poor witless wife. \u201cHe\u2019s struck wi\u2019 her\u2014you can see that. He called her Coz! He\u2019ll marry her, most likely, and make a lady of her; and then she\u2019ll be what her forefathers was.\u201d John Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and this supposition was pleasant to him. \u201cWell, perhaps that\u2019s what young Mr d\u2019Urberville means,\u201d he admitted; \u201cand sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his blood by linking on to the old line.", " Even the spring birds sang over their heads as if they thought there was nobody missing in particular. On inquiry of these precious innocents, to whom even the name of their predecessors was a failing memory, Clare learned that John Durbeyfield was dead; that his widow and children had left Marlott, declaring that they were going to live at Kingsbere, but instead of doing so had gone on to another place they mentioned. By this time Clare abhorred the house for ceasing to contain Tess, and hastened away from its hated presence without once looking back. His way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the dance. It was as bad as the house\u2014even worse. He passed on through the churchyard, where, amongst the new headstones, he saw one of a somewhat superior design to the rest. The inscription ran thus: In memory of John Durbeyfield, rightly d\u2019Urberville, of the once powerful family of that Name, and Direct Descendant through an illustrious Line from Sir Pagan d\u2019Urberville, one of the Knights of the Conqueror."], "Mrs. d\u2019Urberville is ___ and frequently ill.": [" Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required. She was duly informed that Mrs d\u2019Urberville was glad of her decision, and that a spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of the Vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself prepared to start. Mrs d\u2019Urberville\u2019s handwriting seemed rather masculine. \u201cA cart?\u201d murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. \u201cIt might have been a carriage for her own kin!\u201d Having at last taken her course Tess was less restless and abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous. She had hoped to be a teacher at the school, but the fates seemed to decide otherwise. Being mentally older than her mother she did not regard Mrs Durbeyfield\u2019s matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment.", " By the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless. She was Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name? Was she not more truly Mrs Alexander d\u2019Urberville? Could intensity of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable reticence? She knew not what was expected of women in such cases; and she had no counsellor. However, when she found herself alone in her room for a few minutes\u2014the last day this on which she was ever to enter it\u2014she knelt down and prayed. She tried to pray to God, but it was her husband who really had her supplication. Her idolatry of this man was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill-omened. She was conscious of the notion expressed by Friar Laurence: \u201cThese violent delights have violent ends.\u201d It might be too desperate for human conditions\u2014too rank, to wild, too deadly. \u201cO my love, why do I love you so!\u201d she whispered there alone; \u201cfor she you love is not my real self, but one in my image; the one I might have been!\u201d Afternoon came, and with it the hour for departure.", " Nevertheless, the visit of Angel Clare to her well-paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d\u2019Urberville, as she deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade. Tess had spoken to her husband from the doorway, without entering the dining-room, and Mrs Brooks, who stood within the partly-closed door of her own sitting-room at the back of the passage, could hear fragments of the conversation\u2014if conversation it could be called\u2014between those two wretched souls. She heard Tess re-ascend the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of Clare, and the closing of the front door behind him. Then the door of the room above was shut, and Mrs Brooks knew that Tess had re-entered her apartment. As the young lady was not fully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some time.", " \u201cSit down, sit down,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou are ill; and it is natural that you should be.\u201d She did sit down, without knowing where she was, that strained look still upon her face, and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep. \u201cI don\u2019t belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?\u201d she asked helplessly. \u201cIt is not me, but another woman like me that he loved, he says.\u201d The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was ill-used. Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further; she turned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears. Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself. He waited patiently, apathetically, till the violence of her grief had worn itself out, and her rush of weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals. \u201cAngel,\u201d she said suddenly, in her natural tones, the insane, dry voice of terror having left her now."], "What does Retty Priddle do when Angel Clare chooses to marry Tess?": [" \u201cDon\u2019t push! You can see as well as I,\u201d said Retty, the auburn-haired and youngest girl, without removing her eyes from the window. \u201c\u2019Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me, Retty Priddle,\u201d said jolly-faced Marian, the eldest, slily. \u201cHis thoughts be of other cheeks than thine!\u201d Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again. \u201cThere he is again!\u201d cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp hair and keenly cut lips. \u201cYou needn\u2019t say anything, Izz,\u201d answered Retty. \u201cFor I zid you kissing his shade.\u201d _\u201dWhat_ did you see her doing?\u201d asked Marian. \u201cWhy\u2014he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was standing there filling a vat. She put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cO Izz Huett!\u201d said Marian. A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett\u2019s cheek.", " \u201cWell, there was no harm in it,\u201d she declared, with attempted coolness. \u201cAnd if I be in love wi\u2019en, so is Retty, too; and so be you, Marian, come to that.\u201d Marian\u2019s full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness. \u201cI!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a tale! Ah, there he is again! Dear eyes\u2014dear face\u2014dear Mr Clare!\u201d \u201cThere\u2014you\u2019ve owned it!\u201d \u201cSo have you\u2014so have we all,\u201d said Marian, with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion. \u201cIt is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would just marry \u2019n to-morrow!\u201d \u201cSo would I\u2014and more,\u201d murmured Izz Huett. \u201cAnd I too,\u201d whispered the more timid Retty. The listener grew warm. \u201cWe can\u2019t all marry him,\u201d said Izz. \u201cWe shan\u2019t, either of us; which is worse still,\u201d said the eldest. \u201cThere he is again!\u201d They all three blew him a silent kiss. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Retty quickly. \u201cBecause he likes Tess Durbeyfield best,\u201d said Marian, lowering her voice.", " \u201cPretty? Well, yes\u2014they are pretty girls\u2014fresh looking. I have often thought so.\u201d \u201cThough, poor dears, prettiness won\u2019t last long!\u201d \u201cO no, unfortunately.\u201d \u201cThey are excellent dairywomen.\u201d \u201cYes: though not better than you.\u201d \u201cThey skim better than I.\u201d \u201cDo they?\u201d Clare remained observing them\u2014not without their observing him. \u201cShe is colouring up,\u201d continued Tess heroically. \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cRetty Priddle.\u201d \u201cOh! Why it that?\u201d \u201cBecause you are looking at her.\u201d Self-sacrificing as her mood might be, Tess could not well go further and cry, \u201cMarry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and not a lady; and don\u2019t think of marrying me!\u201d She followed Dairyman Crick, and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare remained behind. From this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid him\u2014never allowing herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, even if their juxtaposition were purely accidental.", " In a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room. Marian was soon snoring, but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time. Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep. The deeper-passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then. This conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to swallow that day. Scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her breast. For that matter she knew herself to have the preference. Being more finely formed, better educated, and, though the youngest except Retty, more woman than either, she perceived that only the slightest ordinary care was necessary for holding her own in Angel Clare\u2019s heart against these her candid friends. But the grave question was, ought she to do this? There was, to be sure, hardly a ghost of a chance for either of them, in a serious sense; but there was, or had been, a chance of one or the other inspiring him with a passing fancy for her, and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions while he stayed here."], "How does Mrs. Clare feel about social class?": [" This belief was confirmed by his experience of women, which, having latterly been extended from the cultivated middle-class into the rural community, had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference between the good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman of another social stratum, than between the good and bad, the wise and the foolish, of the same stratum or class. It was the morning of his departure. His brothers had already left the Vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one was to return to his college, and the other to his curacy. Angel might have accompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays. He would have been an awkward member of the party; for, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal religionist, even the best-versed Christologist of the three, there was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him.", " In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice. They said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would not object to see her. Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now. He felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents were, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as middle-class people, which it would require some tact to overcome. For though legally at liberty to do as he chose, and though their daughter-in-law\u2019s qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives, in the probability of her living far away from them, he wished for affection\u2019s sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important decision of his life.", " The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it from a distance, till by residence there it became in turn their Egypt also; and so they changed and changed. However, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. A depopulation was also going on. The village had formerly contained, side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and better-informed class, ranking distinctly above the former\u2014the class to which Tess\u2019s father and mother had belonged\u2014and including the carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with nondescript workers other than farm-labourers; a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess\u2019s father, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders. But as the long holdings fell in, they were seldom again let to similar tenants, and were mostly pulled down, if not absolutely required by the farmer for his hands.", " Nevertheless, the visit of Angel Clare to her well-paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d\u2019Urberville, as she deemed them, was sufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate the feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in its bearings to the letting trade.

As the young lady was not fully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some time."], "What job do Angel\u2019s father and two brothers hold?": [" The aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance, the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one rushing past at each shoulder. The wind blew through Tess\u2019s white muslin to her very skin, and her washed hair flew out behind. She was determined to show no open fear, but she clutched d\u2019Urberville\u2019s rein-arm. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my arm! We shall be thrown out if you do! Hold on round my waist!\u201d She grasped his waist, and so they reached the bottom. \u201cSafe, thank God, in spite of your fooling!\u201d said she, her face on fire. \u201cTess\u2014fie! that\u2019s temper!\u201d said d\u2019Urberville. \u201c\u2019Tis truth.\u201d \u201cWell, you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment you feel yourself out of danger.\u201d She had not considered what she had been doing; whether he were man or woman, stick or stone, in her involuntary hold on him. Recovering her reserve, she sat without replying, and thus they reached the summit of another declivity.", " His father then told him that, as he had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel himself unduly slighted. \u201cAs far as worldly wealth goes,\u201d continued his father, \u201cyou will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.\u201d This considerateness on old Mr Clare\u2019s part led Angel onward to the other and dearer subject. He observed to his father that he was then six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matters\u2014some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield. Would it not be well, therefore, for him to marry? His father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel put the question\u2014 \u201cWhat kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hard-working farmer?\u201d \u201cA truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goings-out and your comings-in.", " \u201cNo, father; I cannot underwrite Article Four (leave alone the rest), taking it \u2018in the literal and grammatical sense\u2019 as required by the Declaration; and, therefore, I can\u2019t be a parson in the present state of affairs,\u201d said Angel. \u201cMy whole instinct in matters of religion is towards reconstruction; to quote your favorite Epistle to the Hebrews, \u2018the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.\u2019\u201d His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him. \u201cWhat is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting ourselves to give you a University education, if it is not to be used for the honour and glory of God?\u201d his father repeated. \u201cWhy, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father.\u201d Perhaps if Angel had persevered he might have gone to Cambridge like his brothers. But the Vicar\u2019s view of that seat of learning as a stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men.", " Perhaps he revered his father\u2019s practice even more now than ever, seeing that, in the question of making Tessy his wife, his father had not once thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless. The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel\u2019s getting a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel admired it none the less. Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren. XXVII An up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd miles through a garish mid-day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a mile or two west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or Froom. Immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals, the very bees and butterflies drowsy."], "Who calls Tess Artemis, Demeter, and Daughter of Nature?": [" The mixed, singular, luminous gloom in which they walked along together to the spot where the cows lay often made him think of the Resurrection hour. He little thought that the Magdalen might be at his side. Whilst all the landscape was in neutral shade his companion\u2019s face, which was the focus of his eyes, rising above the mist stratum, seemed to have a sort of phosphorescence upon it. She looked ghostly, as if she were merely a soul at large. In reality her face, without appearing to do so, had caught the cold gleam of day from the north-east; his own face, though he did not think of it, wore the same aspect to her. It was then, as has been said, that she impressed him most deeply. She was no longer the milkmaid, but a visionary essence of woman\u2014a whole sex condensed into one typical form. He called her Artemis, Demeter, and other fanciful names half teasingly, which she did not like because she did not understand them.", " The afternoon advanced, and still she remained among the willows. She heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands; the \u201cwaow-waow!\u201d which accompanied the getting together of the cows. But she did not go to the milking. They would see her agitation; and the dairyman, thinking the cause to be love alone, would good-naturedly tease her; and that harassment could not be borne. Her lover must have guessed her overwrought state, and invented some excuse for her non-appearance, for no inquiries were made or calls given. At half-past six the sun settled down upon the levels with the aspect of a great forge in the heavens; and presently a monstrous pumpkin-like moon arose on the other hand. The pollard willows, tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings, became spiny-haired monsters as they stood up against it. She went in and upstairs without a light. It was now Wednesday.", " \u201cNow that\u2019s a rum thing, Christianer\u2014hey? To think o\u2019 the miles I\u2019ve vamped o\u2019 starlight nights these last thirty year, courting, or trading, or for doctor, or for nurse, and yet never had the least notion o\u2019 that till now, or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch above my shirt-collar.\u201d The general attention being drawn to her, including that of the dairyman\u2019s pupil, Tess flushed, and remarking evasively that it was only a fancy, resumed her breakfast. Clare continued to observe her. She soon finished her eating, and having a consciousness that Clare was regarding her, began to trace imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched. \u201cWhat a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is!\u201d he said to himself. And then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar, something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past, before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray.", " He would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low Church School of his father; but she would probably be open to conviction on that point; she was a regular church-goer of simple faith; honest-hearted, receptive, intelligent, graceful to a degree, chaste as a vestal, and, in personal appearance, exceptionally beautiful. \u201cIs she of a family such as you would care to marry into\u2014a lady, in short?\u201d asked his startled mother, who had come softly into the study during the conversation. \u201cShe is not what in common parlance is called a lady,\u201d said Angel, unflinchingly, \u201cfor she is a cottager\u2019s daughter, as I am proud to say. But she _is_ a lady, nevertheless\u2014in feeling and nature.\u201d \u201cMercy Chant is of a very good family.\u201d \u201cPooh!\u2014what\u2019s the advantage of that, mother?\u201d said Angel quickly. \u201cHow is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I have, and shall have to do?\u201d \u201cMercy is accomplished."], "In a religious sense, what does Tess represent?": [" \u201cWhy has this been sent to my house?\u201d he asked peremptorily, holding up the volume. \u201cIt was ordered, sir.\u201d \u201cNot by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.\u201d The shopkeeper looked into his order-book. \u201cOh, it has been misdirected, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was ordered by Mr Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.\u201d Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck. He went home pale and dejected, and called Angel into his study. \u201cLook into this book, my boy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d \u201cI ordered it,\u201d said Angel simply. \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cTo read.\u201d \u201cHow can you think of reading it?\u201d \u201cHow can I? Why\u2014it is a system of philosophy. There is no more moral, or even religious, work published.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014moral enough; I don\u2019t deny that. But religious!\u2014and for _you_, who intend to be a minister of the Gospel!\u201d \u201cSince you have alluded to the matter, father,\u201d said the son, with anxious thought upon his face, \u201cI should like to say, once for all, that I should prefer not to take Orders.", " I will walk with you as far as your home.\u201d \u201cO yes,\u201d she answered with a jaded gait. \u201cWalk wi\u2019 me if you will! I do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o\u2019 my state. Perhaps\u2014perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I have been thinking you were. Whatever is meant as kindness I am grateful for; whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at. I cannot sense your meaning sometimes.\u201d \u201cIf I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist you. And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than I formerly showed. My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over. But I retain a little good nature; I hope I do. Now, Tess, by all that\u2019s tender and strong between man and woman, trust me! I have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety, both for yourself and your parents and sisters. I can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me.\u201d \u201cHave you seen \u2019em lately?\u201d she quickly inquired.", " As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten. The long pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so suggestive of merciless treachery; the bill-hook nose, large teeth, and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point of ferocity, haunt the beholder afterwards in his dreams. \u201cWhose portraits are those?\u201d asked Clare of the charwoman. \u201cI have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the d\u2019Urberville family, the ancient lords of this manor,\u201d she said, \u201cOwing to their being builded into the wall they can\u2019t be moved away.\u201d The unpleasantness of the matter was that, in addition to their effect upon Tess, her fine features were unquestionably traceable in these exaggerated forms. He said nothing of this, however, and, regretting that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for their bridal time, went on into the adjoining room.", " The fitful evasiveness of her manner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the idea. So he played a more coaxing game; and while never going beyond words, or attempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost orally. In this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of the purling milk\u2014at the cow\u2019s side, at skimmings, at butter-makings, at cheese-makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs\u2014as no milkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man. Tess knew that she must break down. Neither a religious sense of a certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish for candour could hold out against it much longer. She loved him so passionately, and he was so godlike in her eyes; and being, though untrained, instinctively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary guidance. And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, \u201cI can never be his wife,\u201d the words were vain."], "How does Alec come to be part of the d\u2019Urberville lineage?": [" This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long. To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as a d\u2019Urberville and a lady, he had felt to be temerarious and risky; hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized with worldly ways by a few months\u2019 travel and reading with him, he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line. It was a pretty lover\u2019s dream, if no more. Perhaps Tess\u2019s lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside. Her perception that Angel\u2019s bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it. She rose from breakfast before he had finished, and hastened upstairs.", " Tess uttered a short little \u201cOh!\u201d And a moment after she said, quickly, \u201cI shall eat my dinner here\u2014right on the rick.\u201d Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack. The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d\u2019Urberville, the late Evangelist, despite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack\u2014now an oblong and level platform of sheaves.", " \u201cDon\u2019t you know all\u2014don\u2019t you know it? Yet how do you come here if you do not know?\u201d \u201cI inquired here and there, and I found the way.\u201d \u201cI waited and waited for you,\u201d she went on, her tones suddenly resuming their old fluty pathos. \u201cBut you did not come! And I wrote to you, and you did not come! He kept on saying you would never come any more, and that I was a foolish woman. He was very kind to me, and to mother, and to all of us after father\u2019s death. He\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cHe has won me back to him.\u201d Clare looked at her keenly, then, gathering her meaning, flagged like one plague-stricken, and his glance sank; it fell on her hands, which, once rosy, were now white and more delicate. She continued\u2014 \u201cHe is upstairs. I hate him now, because he told me a lie\u2014that you would not come again; and you _have_ come! These clothes are what he\u2019s put upon me: I didn\u2019t care what he did wi\u2019 me! But\u2014will you go away, Angel, please, and never come any more?\u201d They stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with a joylessness pitiful to see.", " Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of many lights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called the d\u2019Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield\u2019s old seal and spoon. Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it, and put the smaller children inside. \u201cIf it comes to the worst we can sleep there too, for one night,\u201d she said. \u201cBut let us try further on, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess, what\u2019s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!\u201d Accompanied by \u2019Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. \u201cAh\u2014I\u2019m looking for you!\u201d he said, riding up to them. \u201cThis is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!\u201d It was Alec d\u2019Urberville."], "In a religious sense, who does Alec represent?": [" \u201cWhy has this been sent to my house?\u201d he asked peremptorily, holding up the volume. \u201cIt was ordered, sir.\u201d \u201cNot by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.\u201d The shopkeeper looked into his order-book. \u201cOh, it has been misdirected, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was ordered by Mr Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.\u201d Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck. He went home pale and dejected, and called Angel into his study. \u201cLook into this book, my boy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d \u201cI ordered it,\u201d said Angel simply. \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cTo read.\u201d \u201cHow can you think of reading it?\u201d \u201cHow can I? Why\u2014it is a system of philosophy. There is no more moral, or even religious, work published.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014moral enough; I don\u2019t deny that. But religious!\u2014and for _you_, who intend to be a minister of the Gospel!\u201d \u201cSince you have alluded to the matter, father,\u201d said the son, with anxious thought upon his face, \u201cI should like to say, once for all, that I should prefer not to take Orders.", " I will walk with you as far as your home.\u201d \u201cO yes,\u201d she answered with a jaded gait. \u201cWalk wi\u2019 me if you will! I do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o\u2019 my state. Perhaps\u2014perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I have been thinking you were. Whatever is meant as kindness I am grateful for; whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at. I cannot sense your meaning sometimes.\u201d \u201cIf I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist you. And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than I formerly showed. My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over. But I retain a little good nature; I hope I do. Now, Tess, by all that\u2019s tender and strong between man and woman, trust me! I have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety, both for yourself and your parents and sisters. I can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me.\u201d \u201cHave you seen \u2019em lately?\u201d she quickly inquired.", " to keep away.\u201d Then, suddenly: \u201cOne clasp, Tessy\u2014one!

Well, yes\u2014yes!\u201d He clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his weakness. His eyes were equally barren of worldly and religious faith. The corpses of those old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines of his face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come together as in a resurrection. He went out indeterminately. Though d\u2019Urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement to-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, Tess\u2019s words, as echoed from Angel Clare, had made a deep impression upon him, and continued to do so after he had left her. He moved on in silence, as if his energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility that his position was untenable. Reason had had nothing to do with his whimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a careless man in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed by his mother\u2019s death.", " As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten. The long pointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so suggestive of merciless treachery; the bill-hook nose, large teeth, and bold eye of the other suggesting arrogance to the point of ferocity, haunt the beholder afterwards in his dreams. \u201cWhose portraits are those?\u201d asked Clare of the charwoman. \u201cI have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the d\u2019Urberville family, the ancient lords of this manor,\u201d she said, \u201cOwing to their being builded into the wall they can\u2019t be moved away.\u201d The unpleasantness of the matter was that, in addition to their effect upon Tess, her fine features were unquestionably traceable in these exaggerated forms. He said nothing of this, however, and, regretting that he had gone out of his way to choose the house for their bridal time, went on into the adjoining room."], "Angel yearns to dedicate his life to the honor and glory of ___.": [" There was not a human soul near. Sad October and her sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that lane. As she walked, however, some footsteps approached behind her, the footsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his advance he was close at her heels and had said \u201cGood morning\u201d before she had been long aware of his propinquity. He appeared to be an artisan of some sort, and carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand. He asked in a business-like manner if he should take her basket, which she permitted him to do, walking beside him. \u201cIt is early to be astir this Sabbath morn!\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess. \u201cWhen most people are at rest from their week\u2019s work.\u201d She also assented to this. \u201cThough I do more real work to-day than all the week besides.\u201d \u201cDo you?\u201d \u201cAll the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the glory of God.

But the Vicar\u2019s view of that seat of learning as a stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men.", " Whose was this mighty personality?

Why had her husband not written to her? He had distinctly implied that he would at least let her know of the locality to which he had journeyed; but he had not sent a line to notify his address.

The stillness of her head and features was remarkable: she might have been in a trance, her eyes open, yet unseeing. Nothing in the picture moved but Old Pretty\u2019s tail and Tess\u2019s pink hands, the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation only, as if they were obeying a reflex stimulus, like a beating heart. How very lovable her face was to him. Yet there was nothing ethereal about it; all was real vitality, real warmth, real incarnation. And it was in her mouth that this culminated. Eyes almost as deep and speaking he had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair; brows as arched, a chin and throat almost as shapely; her mouth he had seen nothing to equal on the face of the earth.

The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary. She knew how to hit to a hair\u2019s-breadth that moment of evening when the light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of day and the suspense of night neutralize each other, leaving absolute mental liberty. It is then that the plight of being alive becomes attenuated to its least possible dimensions. She had no fear of the shadows; her sole idea seemed to be to shun mankind\u2014or rather that cold accretion called the world, which, so terrible in the mass, is so unformidable, even pitiable, in its units.

But her mood of long-suffering made his way easy for him, and she herself was his best advocate. Pride, too, entered into her submission\u2014which perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too apparent in the whole d\u2019Urberville family\u2014and the many effective chords which she could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched. The remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only. He now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose. The brilliants, the interest in which seemed to be Tess\u2019s for her life only (if he understood the wording of the will), he advised her to let him send to a bank for safety; and to this she readily agreed.", " She could hear from her corner, in addition to these noises, the murmur of their voices. She felt certain that they were continuing the subject already broached, but their voices were so low that she could not catch the words. At last Tess grew more and more anxious to know what they were saying, and, persuading herself that she felt better, she got up and resumed work. Then Izz Huett broke down. She had walked more than a dozen miles the previous evening, had gone to bed at midnight, and had risen again at five o\u2019clock. Marian alone, thanks to her bottle of liquor and her stoutness of build, stood the strain upon back and arms without suffering. Tess urged Izz to leave off, agreeing, as she felt better, to finish the day without her, and make equal division of the number of sheaves. Izz accepted the offer gratefully, and disappeared through the great door into the snowy track to her lodging."], "What symbol is used to convey both the majestic grandeur and the lifeless hollowness of an aristocratic name?": [" Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name, Clare said\u2014 \u201cOf a Miss Durbeyfield?\u201d \u201cDurbeyfield?\u201d This also was strange to the postman addressed. \u201cThere\u2019s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cand without the name of the house \u2019tis impossible to find \u2019em.\u201d One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated to him. \u201cI know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d\u2019Urberville at The Herons,\u201d said the second. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation. \u201cWhat place is The Herons?\u201d \u201cA stylish lodging-house. \u2019Tis all lodging-houses here, bless \u2019ee.\u201d Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither, arriving with the milkman.

Yet he was not an extravagant-minded man in this, and in constructing his family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his inter-marriages and aristocratic links, never inserting a single title above a rank of strict moderation. Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally in ignorance\u2014much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very possibility of such annexations was unknown to them; who supposed that, though to be well-favoured might be the gift of fortune, a family name came by nature. Tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge, hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere, when a figure came forth from the dark triangular door of the tent.", " Poor child!

Nick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched itself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from the matron\u2019s elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the verse, Mrs Durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while. Even now, when burdened with a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune.", " Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required.

But Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel Clare; and it sustained her. The swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets\u2014the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes."], "Where does John go to celebrate his newly-discovered noble lineage?": [" Her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents?

It was a pretty lover\u2019s dream, if no more. Perhaps Tess\u2019s lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside.

Rising still, an immense landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the green valley of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew nothing except from her first brief visit to Trantridge. Thus they reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a long straight descent of nearly a mile. Ever since the accident with her father\u2019s horse Tess Durbeyfield, courageous as she naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her. She began to get uneasy at a certain recklessness in her conductor\u2019s driving.", " She was a fine and handsome girl\u2014not handsomer than some others, possibly\u2014but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape. She wore a red ribbon in her hair, and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced adornment. As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzle-headed brawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above her elbows. This was the cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times. Durbeyfield, leaning back, and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was waving his hand above his head, and singing in a slow recitative\u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve-got-a-gr\u2019t-family-vault-at-Kingsbere\u2014and knighted-forefathers-in-lead-coffins-there!\u201d The clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess\u2014in whom a slow heat seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish in their eyes.", " Each pedestrian could see no halo but his or her own, which never deserted the head-shadow, whatever its vulgar unsteadiness might be; but adhered to it, and persistently beautified it; till the erratic motions seemed an inherent part of the irradiation, and the fumes of their breathing a component of the night\u2019s mist; and the spirit of the scene, and of the moonlight, and of Nature, seemed harmoniously to mingle with the spirit of wine. XI The twain cantered along for some time without speech, Tess as she clung to him still panting in her triumph, yet in other respects dubious. She had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one he sometimes rose, and felt no alarm on that score, though her seat was precarious enough despite her tight hold of him. She begged him to slow the animal to a walk, which Alec accordingly did. \u201cNeatly done, was it not, dear Tess?\u201d he said by and by. \u201cYes!\u201d said she.", " Tess uttered a short little \u201cOh!\u201d And a moment after she said, quickly, \u201cI shall eat my dinner here\u2014right on the rick.\u201d Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack. The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d\u2019Urberville, the late Evangelist, despite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack\u2014now an oblong and level platform of sheaves."], "Who agrees to help Tess learn how to blow whistles?": [" But she was such a sheaf of susceptibilities that her pulse was accelerated by the touch, her blood driven to her finger-ends, and the cool arms flushed hot. Then, as though her heart had said, \u201cIs coyness longer necessary? Truth is truth between man and woman, as between man and man,\u201d she lifted her eyes and they beamed devotedly into his, as her lip rose in a tender half-smile. \u201cDo you know why I did that, Tess?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you love me very much!\u201d \u201cYes, and as a preliminary to a new entreaty.\u201d \u201cNot _again_!\u201d She looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under her own desire. \u201cO, Tessy!\u201d he went on, \u201cI _cannot_ think why you are so tantalizing. Why do you disappoint me so? You seem almost like a coquette, upon my life you do\u2014a coquette of the first urban water!

I am rather out of her books just now, but you will be quite in favour if you treat her live-stock well. Good morning. If you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don\u2019t go to the bailiff, come to me.\u201d It was in the economy of this _r\u00e9gime_ that Tess Durbeyfield had undertaken to fill a place. Her first day\u2019s experiences were fairly typical of those which followed through many succeeding days. A familiarity with Alec d\u2019Urberville\u2019s presence\u2014which that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly calling her his cousin when they were alone\u2014removed much of her original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind.", " \u201cHe\u2019s tired, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said hastily, \u201cand he has got a lift home, because our own horse has to rest to-day.\u201d \u201cBless thy simplicity, Tess,\u201d said her companions. \u201cHe\u2019s got his market-nitch. Haw-haw!\u201d \u201cLook here; I won\u2019t walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes about him!\u201d Tess cried, and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her face and neck. In a moment her eyes grew moist, and her glance drooped to the ground. Perceiving that they had really pained her they said no more, and order again prevailed. Tess\u2019s pride would not allow her to turn her head again, to learn what her father\u2019s meaning was, if he had any; and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green. By the time the spot was reached she had recovered her equanimity, and tapped her neighbour with her wand and talked as usual. Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion untinctured by experience.", " I should never have dreamt of doing it on mine. However, to do it with my own hand is too good for me, after all. It is you, my ruined husband, who ought to strike the blow. I think I should love you more, if that were possible, if you could bring yourself to do it, since there\u2019s no other way of escape for \u2019ee. I feel I am so utterly worthless! So very greatly in the way!\u201d \u201cSsh!\u201d \u201cWell, since you say no, I won\u2019t. I have no wish opposed to yours.\u201d He knew this to be true enough. Since the desperation of the night her activities had dropped to zero, and there was no further rashness to be feared. Tess tried to busy herself again over the breakfast-table with more or less success, and they sat down both on the same side, so that their glances did not meet. There was at first something awkward in hearing each other eat and drink, but this could not be escaped; moreover, the amount of eating done was small on both sides."], "When Tess\u2019s friends get drunk, why are they irritated with Tess?": [" It was, indeed, quite true that the household had not been shining examples either of temperance, soberness, or chastity. The father, and even the mother, had got drunk at times, the younger children seldom had gone to church, and the eldest daughter had made queer unions. By some means the village had to be kept pure. So on this, the first Lady-Day on which the Durbeyfields were expellable, the house, being roomy, was required for a carter with a large family; and Widow Joan, her daughters Tess and \u2019Liza-Lu, the boy Abraham, and the younger children had to go elsewhere. On the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by reason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky. As it was the last night they would spend in the village which had been their home and birthplace, Mrs Durbeyfield, \u2019Liza-Lu, and Abraham had gone out to bid some friends goodbye, and Tess was keeping house till they should return.", " \u201c\u2014Being a few private friends asked in to-night to keep up club-walking at my own expense.\u201d The landlady had rapidly re-used the formula she kept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was Tess. Even to her mother\u2019s gaze the girl\u2019s young features looked sadly out of place amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable medium for wrinkled middle-age; and hardly was a reproachful flash from Tess\u2019s dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their seats, hastily finish their ale, and descend the stairs behind her, Mrs Rolliver\u2019s caution following their footsteps. \u201cNo noise, please, if ye\u2019ll be so good, my dears; or I mid lose my licends, and be summons\u2019d, and I don\u2019t know what all! \u2019Night t\u2019ye!\u201d They went home together, Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs Durbeyfield the other. He had, in truth, drunk very little\u2014not a fourth of the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a Sunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections; but the weakness of Sir John\u2019s constitution made mountains of his petty sins in this kind.", " \u201cAnd, more than this, there\u2019s Marian; she\u2019s been found dead drunk by the withy-bed\u2014a girl who hev never been known to touch anything before except shilling ale; though, to be sure, \u2019a was always a good trencher-woman, as her face showed. It seems as if the maids had all gone out o\u2019 their minds!\u201d \u201cAnd Izz?\u201d asked Tess. \u201cIzz is about house as usual; but \u2019a do say \u2019a can guess how it happened; and she seems to be very low in mind about it, poor maid, as well she mid be. And so you see, sir, as all this happened just when we was packing your few traps and your Mis\u2019ess\u2019s night-rail and dressing things into the cart, why, it belated me.\u201d \u201cYes. Well, Jonathan, will you get the trunks upstairs, and drink a cup of ale, and hasten back as soon as you can, in case you should be wanted?\u201d Tess had gone back to the inner parlour, and sat down by the fire, looking wistfully into it. She heard Jonathan Kail\u2019s heavy footsteps up and down the stairs till he had done placing the luggage, and heard him express his thanks for the ale her husband took out to him, and for the gratuity he received.", " Out of doors there began noises as of silk smartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection, and whirled about unwillingly, and tapped against the shutters. It soon began to rain. \u201cThat cock knew the weather was going to change,\u201d said Clare. The woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night, but she had placed candles upon the table, and now they lit them. Each candle-flame drew towards the fireplace. \u201cThese old houses are so draughty,\u201d continued Angel, looking at the flames, and at the grease guttering down the sides. \u201cI wonder where that luggage is. We haven\u2019t even a brush and comb.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered, absent-minded. \u201cTess, you are not a bit cheerful this evening\u2014not at all as you used to be. Those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled you. I am sorry I brought you here. I wonder if you really love me, after all?\u201d He knew that she did, and the words had no serious intent; but she was surcharged with emotion, and winced like a wounded animal."], "What does Alec buy for Tess\u2019s father in order to win Tess\u2019s favor?": [" \u201cTess won\u2019t go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy of!\u2014no, she says she wo-o-on\u2019t!\u201d they wailed, with square mouths. \u201cAnd we shan\u2019t have a nice new horse, and lots o\u2019 golden money to buy fairlings! And Tess won\u2019t look pretty in her best cloze no mo-o-ore!\u201d Her mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them indefinitely, also weighed in the argument. Her father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality. \u201cI will go,\u201d said Tess at last. Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision conjured up by the girl\u2019s consent. \u201cThat\u2019s right! For such a pretty maid as \u2019tis, this is a fine chance!\u201d Tess smiled crossly. \u201cI hope it is a chance for earning money. It is no other kind of chance. You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish.\u201d Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise.

What nonsense be ye talking! Go away, and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready!... Well, Tess ought to go to this other member of our family. She\u2019d be sure to win the lady\u2014Tess would; and likely enough \u2019twould lead to some noble gentleman marrying her. In short, I know it.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cI tried her fate in the _Fortune-Teller_, and it brought out that very thing!... You should ha\u2019 seen how pretty she looked to-day; her skin is as sumple as a duchess\u2019.\u201d \u201cWhat says the maid herself to going?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve not asked her.", " \u201cAngel, am I too wicked for you and me to live together?\u201d \u201cI have not been able to think what we can do.\u201d \u201cI shan\u2019t ask you to let me live with you, Angel, because I have no right to!

But it strikes me that there is a want of harmony between your present mood of self-sacrifice and your past mood of self-preservation.\u201d These were the first words of antagonism. To fling elaborate sarcasms at Tess, however, was much like flinging them at a dog or cat.", " Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; she wondered if he had gone back to her father\u2019s house; and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards. Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters. \u201cO, Tessy\u2014what do you think! \u2019Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there\u2019s a lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think father is dead!\u201d The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till, beholding the effect produced upon her, she said\u2014 \u201cWhat, Tess, shan\u2019t we talk to father never no more?\u201d \u201cBut father was only a little bit ill!\u201d exclaimed Tess distractedly. \u2019Liza-Lu came up. \u201cHe dropped down just now, and the doctor who was there for mother said there was no chance for him, because his heart was growed in.\u201d Yes; the Durbeyfield couple had changed places; the dying one was out of danger, and the indisposed one was dead."], "What is Tess doing when Alec first takes advantage of her sexually?": [" The brim-fulness of her nature breathed from her. It was a moment when a woman\u2019s soul is more incarnate than at any other time; when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself flesh; and sex takes the outside place in the presentation. Then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness, before the remainder of her face was well awake. With an oddly compounded look of gladness, shyness, and surprise, she exclaimed\u2014\u201cO Mr Clare! How you frightened me\u2014I\u2014\u201d There had not at first been time for her to think of the changed relations which his declaration had introduced; but the full sense of the matter rose up in her face when she encountered Clare\u2019s tender look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair. \u201cDear, darling Tessy!\u201d he whispered, putting his arm round her, and his face to her flushed cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t, for Heaven\u2019s sake, Mister me any more. I have hastened back so soon because of you!\u201d Tess\u2019s excitable heart beat against his by way of reply; and there they stood upon the red-brick floor of the entry, the sun slanting in by the window upon his back, as he held her tightly to his breast; upon her inclining face, upon the blue veins of her temple, upon her naked arm, and her neck, and into the depths of her hair.", " Tess uttered a short little \u201cOh!\u201d And a moment after she said, quickly, \u201cI shall eat my dinner here\u2014right on the rick.\u201d Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack. The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d\u2019Urberville, the late Evangelist, despite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack\u2014now an oblong and level platform of sheaves.", " Tess, the little rogue! And have she really paid \u2019em a visit to such an end as this?\u201d Meanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry-bushes in the garden, and over Prince\u2019s grave. When she came in her mother pursued her advantage. \u201cWell, what be you going to do?\u201d she asked. \u201cI wish I had seen Mrs d\u2019Urberville,\u201d said Tess. \u201cI think you mid as well settle it. Then you\u2019ll see her soon enough.\u201d Her father coughed in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say!\u201d answered the girl restlessly. \u201cIt is for you to decide. I killed the old horse, and I suppose I ought to do something to get ye a new one. But\u2014but\u2014I don\u2019t quite like Mr d\u2019Urberville being there!\u201d The children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by their wealthy kinsfolk (which they imagined the other family to be) as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry at Tess\u2019s reluctance, and teased and reproached her for hesitating.", " And if he don\u2019t marry her afore he will after.

Rising still, an immense landscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the green valley of her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew nothing except from her first brief visit to Trantridge. Thus they reached the verge of an incline down which the road stretched in a long straight descent of nearly a mile. Ever since the accident with her father\u2019s horse Tess Durbeyfield, courageous as she naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her.

For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was chosen for this particular duty, and Groby gave as his motive in selecting Tess that she was one of those who best combined strength with quickness in untying, and both with staying power, and this may have been true.", " The most impressed of them said: \u201cBe you really going to christen him, Tess?\u201d The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name going to be?\u201d She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service, and now she pronounced it: \u201cSORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d She sprinkled the water, and there was silence. \u201cSay \u2018Amen,\u2019 children.\u201d The tiny voices piped in obedient response, \u201cAmen!\u201d Tess went on: \u201cWe receive this child\u201d\u2014and so forth\u2014\u201cand do sign him with the sign of the Cross.\u201d Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life\u2019s end.", " It was from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair.

And to please her parent the girl put herself quite in Joan\u2019s hands, saying serenely\u2014\u201cDo what you like with me, mother.\u201d Mrs Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability. First she fetched a great basin, and washed Tess\u2019s hair with such thoroughness that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as at other times. She tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual. Then she put upon her the white frock that Tess had worn at the club-walking, the airy fulness of which, supplementing her enlarged _coiffure_, imparted to her developing figure an amplitude which belied her age, and might cause her to be estimated as a woman when she was not much more than a child. \u201cI declare there\u2019s a hole in my stocking-heel!\u201d said Tess. \u201cNever mind holes in your stockings\u2014they don\u2019t speak!

It was a misfortune\u2014in more ways than one. No sooner did the dark queen hear the soberer richer note of Tess among those of the other work-people than a long-smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to madness.

Tess could eventually join him there, and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem impracticable to him here. In brief he was strongly inclined to try Brazil, especially as the season for going thither was just at hand. With this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan to his parents, and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated them. As he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face, just as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks; but his face was thinner now.

He found that the statement was true, and paid the bill. This done, he turned in the direction of the migrants. The distance was too long for a walk, but Clare felt such a strong desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually reach the place.", " \u201cYou must zee yourself!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt is much better than you was t\u2019other day.\u201d As the looking-glass was only large enough to reflect a very small portion of Tess\u2019s person at one time, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black cloak outside the casement, and so made a large reflector of the panes, as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do. After this she went downstairs to her husband, who was sitting in the lower room. \u201cI\u2019ll tell \u2019ee what \u2019tis, Durbeyfield,\u201d said she exultingly; \u201che\u2019ll never have the heart not to love her.

Besides, that\u2019s not all the difficulty; it lies in another consideration\u2014one bearing upon the future of other people than ourselves.

Clare came close, and bent over her. \u201cDead, dead, dead!\u201d he murmured. After fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of unmeasurable woe, he bent lower, enclosed her in his arms, and rolled her in the sheet as in a shroud. Then lifting her from the bed with as much respect as one would show to a dead body, he carried her across the room, murmuring\u2014 \u201cMy poor, poor Tess\u2014my dearest, darling Tess! So sweet, so good, so true!\u201d The words of endearment, withheld so severely in his waking hours, were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart. If it had been to save her weary life she would not, by moving or struggling, have put an end to the position she found herself in. Thus she lay in absolute stillness, scarcely venturing to breathe, and, wondering what he was going to do with her, suffered herself to be borne out upon the landing.", " The baby\u2019s offence against society in coming into the world was forgotten by the girl-mother; her soul\u2019s desire was to continue that offence by preserving the life of the child. However, it soon grew clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured. And when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which transcended that of the child\u2019s simple loss. Her baby had not been baptized. Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done, burn she must, and there was an end of it. Like all village girls, she was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully studied the histories of Aholah and Aholibah, and knew the inferences to be drawn therefrom. But when the same question arose with regard to the baby, it had a very different colour.", " The room was empty; the breakfast\u2014a substantial repast of coffee, eggs, and a cold ham\u2014lay spread upon the table untouched, as when she had taken it up, excepting that the carving-knife was missing. She asked the man to go through the folding-doors into the adjoining room. He opened the doors, entered a step or two, and came back almost instantly with a rigid face. \u201cMy good God, the gentleman in bed is dead! I think he has been hurt with a knife\u2014a lot of blood has run down upon the floor!\u201d The alarm was soon given, and the house which had lately been so quiet resounded with the tramp of many footsteps, a surgeon among the rest. The wound was small, but the point of the blade had touched the heart of the victim, who lay on his back, pale, fixed, dead, as if he had scarcely moved after the infliction of the blow. In a quarter of an hour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary visitor to the town had been stabbed in his bed, spread through every street and villa of the popular watering-place.", " It had come from the corner step of the staircase, which, as usual, was loosely nailed. She saw the door of her bedroom open, and the figure of her husband crossed the stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread. He was in his shirt and trousers only, and her first flush of joy died when she perceived that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy. When he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in tones of indescribable sadness\u2014 \u201cDead! dead! dead!\u201d Under the influence of any strongly-disturbing force, Clare would occasionally walk in his sleep, and even perform strange feats, such as he had done on the night of their return from market just before their marriage, when he re-enacted in his bedroom his combat with the man who had insulted her. Tess saw that continued mental distress had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now. Her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart, that, awake or asleep, he inspired her with no sort of personal fear."], "When Tess realizes that she can never be happy at Marlott, what job does she take at Talbothays Dairy?": [" After again leaving Marlott, her home, she had got through the spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers, the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairy-work near Port-Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley, equally remote from her native place and from Talbothays. She preferred this to living on his allowance. Mentally she remained in utter stagnation, a condition which the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked. Her consciousness was at that other dairy, at that other season, in the presence of the tender lover who had confronted her there\u2014he who, the moment she had grasped him to keep for her own, had disappeared like a shape in a vision. The dairy-work lasted only till the milk began to lessen, for she had not met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays, but had done duty as a supernumerary only. However, as harvest was now beginning, she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty of further occupation, and this continued till harvest was done.", " Yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed. They were both young, and they were talking of the time when they lived and loved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts; in substance to all, emotionally to these. Tess would fain not have conversed with Marian of the man who was legally, if not actually, her husband; but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating Marian\u2019s remarks. And thus, as has been said, though the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces, and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all this afternoon in memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays. \u201cYou can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o\u2019 Froom Valley from here when \u2019tis fine,\u201d said Marian. \u201cAh! Can you?\u201d said Tess, awake to the new value of this locality.", " His name she had obviously never used during their separation, and her dignified sense of their total severance was shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had chosen to undergo (of which he now learnt for the first time) rather than apply to his father for more funds. From this place they told him Tess Durbeyfield had gone, without due notice, to the home of her parents on the other side of Blackmoor, and it therefore became necessary to find Mrs Durbeyfield. She had told him she was not now at Marlott, but had been curiously reticent as to her actual address, and the only course was to go to Marlott and inquire for it. The farmer who had been so churlish with Tess was quite smooth-tongued to Clare, and lent him a horse and man to drive him towards Marlott, the gig he had arrived in being sent back to Emminster; for the limit of a day\u2019s journey with that horse was reached.", " Their position was perhaps the happiest of all positions in the social scale, being above the line at which neediness ends, and below the line at which the _convenances_ begin to cramp natural feelings, and the stress of threadbare modishness makes too little of enough. Thus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one thing aimed at out of doors. Tess and Clare unconsciously studied each other, ever balanced on the edge of a passion, yet apparently keeping out of it. All the while they were converging, under an irresistible law, as surely as two streams in one vale. Tess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now, possibly never would be so happy again. She was, for one thing, physically and mentally suited among these new surroundings. The sapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of its sowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil."], "Who is the master dairyman at Talbothays?": [" Did I not ask you flatly to be my wife\u2014hey? Answer me.\u201d \u201cYou did.\u201d \u201cAnd you cannot be. But remember one thing!\u201d His voice hardened as his temper got the better of him with the recollection of his sincerity in asking her and her present ingratitude, and he stepped across to her side and held her by the shoulders, so that she shook under his grasp. \u201cRemember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man\u2019s wife you are mine!\u201d The threshers now began to stir below. \u201cSo much for our quarrel,\u201d he said, letting her go. \u201cNow I shall leave you, and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon. You don\u2019t know me yet! But I know you.\u201d She had not spoken again, remaining as if stunned. D\u2019Urberville retreated over the sheaves, and descended the ladder, while the workers below rose and stretched their arms, and shook down the beer they had drunk. Then the threshing-machine started afresh; and amid the renewed rustle of the straw Tess resumed her position by the buzzing drum as one in a dream, untying sheaf after sheaf in endless succession.", " Each girl sat down on her three-legged stool, her face sideways, her right cheek resting against the cow, and looked musingly along the animal\u2019s flank at Tess as she approached. The male milkers, with hat-brims turned down, resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not observe her. One of these was a sturdy middle-aged man\u2014whose long white \u201cpinner\u201d was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect\u2014the master-dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as a working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the seventh as a man in shining broad-cloth in his family pew at church, being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme: Dairyman Dick All the week: On Sundays Mister Richard Crick. Seeing Tess standing at gaze he went across to her. The majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time, but it happened that Mr Crick was glad to get a new hand\u2014for the days were busy ones now\u2014and he received her warmly; inquiring for her mother and the rest of the family\u2014(though this as a matter of form merely, for in reality he had not been aware of Mrs Durbeyfield\u2019s existence till apprised of the fact by a brief business-letter about Tess).", " The conviction bred serenity, her pulse slowed, and she was able to look about her. The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the men operating on the hard-teated animals, the maids on the kindlier natures. It was a large dairy. There were nearly a hundred milchers under Crick\u2019s management, all told; and of the herd the master-dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands, unless away from home. These were the cows that milked hardest of all; for his journey-milkmen being more or less casually hired, he would not entrust this half-dozen to their treatment, lest, from indifference, they should not milk them fully; nor to the maids, lest they should fail in the same way for lack of finger-grip; with the result that in course of time the cows would \u201cgo azew\u201d\u2014that is, dry up. It was not the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious, but that with the decline of demand there came decline, and ultimately cessation, of supply.", " Squish, squash echoed the milk in the great cylinder, but never arose the sound they waited for. Dairyman Crick and his wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty Priddle, Izz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also Mr Clare, Jonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood gazing hopelessly at the churn; and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on moon-like eyes to show his sense of the situation. Even the melancholy horse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring despair at each walk round. \u201c\u2019Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle\u2019s son in Egdon\u2014years!\u201d said the dairyman bitterly. \u201cAnd he was nothing to what his father had been. I have said fifty times, if I have said once, that I _don\u2019t_ believe in en; though \u2019a do cast folks\u2019 waters very true. But I shall have to go to \u2019n if he\u2019s alive. O yes, I shall have to go to \u2019n, if this sort of thing continnys!\u201d Even Mr Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman\u2019s desperation."], "Who was Angel involved with before coming to Talbothays?": [" A day or two passed while he waited at his father\u2019s house for the promised second note from Joan Durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover a little more strength. The strength showed signs of coming back, but there was no sign of Joan\u2019s letter. Then he hunted up the old letter sent on to him in Brazil, which Tess had written from Flintcomb-Ash, and re-read it. The sentences touched him now as much as when he had first perused them. ...I must cry to you in my trouble\u2014I have no one else!... I think I must die if you do not come soon, or tell me to come to you... please, please, not to be just\u2014only a little kind to me.... If you would come, I could die in your arms! I would be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me!... if you will send me one little line, and say, _I am coming soon_, I will bide on, Angel\u2014O, so cheerfully!... think how it do hurt my heart not to see you ever\u2014ever!", " Angel\u2019s companion was also an Englishman, bent on the same errand, though he came from another part of the island. They were both in a state of mental depression, and they spoke of home affairs. Confidence begat confidence. With that curious tendency evinced by men, more especially when in distant lands, to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they would on no account mention to friends, Angel admitted to this man as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage. The stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more peoples than Angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the social norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the irregularities of vale and mountain-chain to the whole terrestrial curve. He viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel; thought that what Tess had been was of no importance beside what she would be, and plainly told Clare that he was wrong in coming away from her.", " And before I get involved in the multifarious details of my new position, I should like to have secured my partner.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d she timidly answered, \u201cto talk quite practically, wouldn\u2019t it be best not to marry till after all that?\u2014Though I can\u2019t bear the thought o\u2019 your going away and leaving me here!\u201d \u201cOf course you cannot\u2014and it is not best in this case. I want you to help me in many ways in making my start. When shall it be? Why not a fortnight from now?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, becoming grave: \u201cI have so many things to think of first.\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201d He drew her gently nearer to him. The reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near. Before discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment Mr Dairyman Crick, Mrs Crick, and two of the milkmaids. Tess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet, while her face flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight.", " At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirt-sleeves and put his arm across the stairway. \u201cNow, Miss Flirt, before you go down,\u201d he said peremptorily. \u201cIt is a fortnight since I spoke, and this won\u2019t do any longer. You _must_ tell me what you mean, or I shall have to leave this house. My door was ajar just now, and I saw you. For your own safety I must go. You don\u2019t know. Well? Is it to be yes at last?\u201d \u201cI am only just up, Mr Clare, and it is too early to take me to task!\u201d she pouted. \u201cYou need not call me Flirt. \u2019Tis cruel and untrue. Wait till by and by. Please wait till by and by! I will really think seriously about it between now and then. Let me go downstairs!\u201d She looked a little like what he said she was as, holding the candle sideways, she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words. \u201cCall me Angel, then, and not Mr Clare.\u201d \u201cAngel.\u201d \u201cAngel dearest\u2014why not?\u201d \u201c\u2019Twould mean that I agree, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt would only mean that you love me, even if you cannot marry me; and you were so good as to own that long ago.\u201d \u201cVery well, then, \u2018Angel dearest\u2019, if I _must_,\u201d she murmured, looking at her candle, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding her suspense."], "Why does Tess initially try to stay away from Angel?": [" \u201cNow, let us understand each other,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThere is no anger between us, though there is that which I cannot endure at present. I will try to bring myself to endure it. I will let you know where I go to as soon as I know myself. And if I can bring myself to bear it\u2014if it is desirable, possible\u2014I will come to you. But until I come to you it will be better that you should not try to come to me.\u201d The severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess; she saw his view of her clearly enough; he could regard her in no other light than that of one who had practised gross deceit upon him. Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this? But she could contest the point with him no further. She simply repeated after him his own words. \u201cUntil you come to me I must not try to come to you?\u201d \u201cJust so.\u201d \u201cMay I write to you?\u201d \u201cO yes\u2014if you are ill, or want anything at all. I hope that will not be the case; so that it may happen that I write first to you.\u201d \u201cI agree to the conditions, Angel; because you know best what my punishment ought to be; only\u2014only\u2014don\u2019t make it more than I can bear!\u201d That was all she said on the matter.", " \u201cI want to leave you, and go home.\u201d \u201cThen it shall be so.\u201d Though she did not look up at him, she started. There was a difference between the proposition and the covenant, which she had felt only too quickly. \u201cI feared it would come to this,\u201d she murmured, her countenance meekly fixed. \u201cI don\u2019t complain, Angel, I\u2014I think it best. What you said has quite convinced me. Yes, though nobody else should reproach me if we should stay together, yet somewhen, years hence, you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter, and knowing what you do of my bygones, you yourself might be tempted to say words, and they might be overheard, perhaps by my own children. O, what only hurts me now would torture and kill me then! I will go\u2014to-morrow.\u201d \u201cAnd I shall not stay here. Though I didn\u2019t like to initiate it, I have seen that it was advisable we should part\u2014at least for a while, till I can better see the shape that things have taken, and can write to you.\u201d Tess stole a glance at her husband.", " There are many questions that I am tempted to ask, but I will not do so, of course, in opposition to your wishes. Though, if I could know your husband, I might more easily benefit him and you. Is he on this farm?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHe is far away.\u201d \u201cFar away? From _you_? What sort of husband can he be?\u201d \u201cO, do not speak against him! It was through you! He found out\u2014\u201d \u201cAh, is it so!... That\u2019s sad, Tess!\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBut to stay away from you\u2014to leave you to work like this!\u201d \u201cHe does not leave me to work!\u201d she cried, springing to the defence of the absent one with all her fervour. \u201cHe don\u2019t know it! It is by my own arrangement.\u201d \u201cThen, does he write?\u201d \u201cI\u2014I cannot tell you. There are things which are private to ourselves.\u201d \u201cOf course that means that he does not. You are a deserted wife, my fair Tess\u2014\u201d In an impulse he turned suddenly to take her hand; the buff-glove was on it, and he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not express the life or shape of those within.", " Tess felt that she could not have come to a much worse place; but anything was better than gallantry. When two o\u2019clock arrived the professional reed-drawers tossed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks, tied their last sheaves, and went away. Marian and Izz would have done likewise, but on hearing that Tess meant to stay, to make up by longer hours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her. Looking out at the snow, which still fell, Marian exclaimed, \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got it all to ourselves.\u201d And so at last the conversation turned to their old experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the incidents of their affection for Angel Clare. \u201cIzz and Marian,\u201d said Mrs Angel Clare, with a dignity which was extremely touching, seeing how very little of a wife she was: \u201cI can\u2019t join in talk with you now, as I used to do, about Mr Clare; you will see that I cannot; because, although he is gone away from me for the present, he is my husband.\u201d Izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls who had loved Clare."], "Angel breaks the rules by arranging for Tess to have her favorite ___ to work with.": [" \u201cNo, father; I cannot underwrite Article Four (leave alone the rest), taking it \u2018in the literal and grammatical sense\u2019 as required by the Declaration; and, therefore, I can\u2019t be a parson in the present state of affairs,\u201d said Angel. \u201cMy whole instinct in matters of religion is towards reconstruction; to quote your favorite Epistle to the Hebrews, \u2018the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.\u2019\u201d His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him. \u201cWhat is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting ourselves to give you a University education, if it is not to be used for the honour and glory of God?\u201d his father repeated. \u201cWhy, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father.\u201d Perhaps if Angel had persevered he might have gone to Cambridge like his brothers. But the Vicar\u2019s view of that seat of learning as a stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men.", " Only two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house besides herself, most of the helpers going to their homes. She saw nothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on the story, and asked no questions about him, the remainder of the evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bed-chamber. It was a large room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the sleeping-cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same apartment. They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather older than herself. By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell asleep immediately. But one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful than Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered. The girl\u2019s whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess\u2019s drowsy mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they floated.", " Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. A difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate self-consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and showed that they were genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many eyes. And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which, though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will. They were all cheerful, and many of them merry. They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the high road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of the women said\u2014 \u201cThe Load-a-Lord! Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn\u2019t thy father riding hwome in a carriage!\u201d A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation.", " I am desolate without you, my darling, O, so desolate! I do not mind having to work: but if you will send me one little line, and say, \u201c_I am coming soon_\u201d, I will bide on, Angel\u2014O, so cheerfully! It has been so much my religion ever since we were married to be faithful to you in every thought and look, that even when a man speaks a compliment to me before I am aware, it seems wronging you. Have you never felt one little bit of what you used to feel when we were at the dairy? If you have, how can you keep away from me? I am the same woman, Angel, as you fell in love with; yes, the very same!\u2014not the one you disliked but never saw. What was the past to me as soon as I met you? It was a dead thing altogether. I became another woman, filled full of new life from you. How could I be the early one? Why do you not see this? Dear, if you would only be a little more conceited, and believe in yourself so far as to see that you were strong enough to work this change in me, you would perhaps be in a mind to come to me, your poor wife."], "What instrument does Angel play?": [" To neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to mention Tess. His mother made him sandwiches, and his father accompanied him, on his own mare, a little way along the road. Having fairly well advanced his own affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence, as they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his father\u2019s account of his parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved, because of his strict interpretations of the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious Calvinistic doctrine. \u201cPernicious!\u201d said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea. He told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and well-to-do; and he also candidly admitted many failures. As an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young upstart squire named d\u2019Urberville, living some forty miles off, in the neighbourhood of Trantridge.", " It was a typical summer evening in June, the atmosphere being in such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects seemed endowed with two or three senses, if not five. There was no distinction between the near and the far, and an auditor felt close to everything within the horizon. The soundlessness impressed her as a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise. It was broken by the strumming of strings. Tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head. Dim, flattened, constrained by their confinement, they had never appealed to her as now, when they wandered in the still air with a stark quality like that of nudity. To speak absolutely, both instrument and execution were poor; but the relative is all, and as she listened Tess, like a fascinated bird, could not leave the spot. Far from leaving she drew up towards the performer, keeping behind the hedge that he might not guess her presence.", " You have made me so restless that I cannot read, or play, or do anything. I am in no hurry, Tess, but I want to know\u2014to hear from your own warm lips\u2014that you will some day be mine\u2014any time you may choose; but some day?\u201d She could only shake her head and look away from him. Clare regarded her attentively, conned the characters of her face as if they had been hieroglyphics. The denial seemed real. \u201cThen I ought not to hold you in this way\u2014ought I? I have no right to you\u2014no right to seek out where you are, or walk with you! Honestly, Tess, do you love any other man?\u201d \u201cHow can you ask?\u201d she said, with continued self-suppression. \u201cI almost know that you do not. But then, why do you repulse me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t repulse you. I like you to\u2014tell me you love me; and you may always tell me so as you go about with me\u2014and never offend me.\u201d \u201cBut you will not accept me as a husband?\u201d \u201cAh\u2014that\u2019s different\u2014it is for your good, indeed, my dearest!", " \u201cShe is rich, and she\u2019d be sure to take notice o\u2019 the maid,\u201d continued Mrs Durbeyfield; \u201cand \u2019twill be a very good thing. I don\u2019t see why two branches o\u2019 one family should not be on visiting terms.\u201d \u201cYes; and we\u2019ll all claim kin!\u201d said Abraham brightly from under the bedstead. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with her; and we\u2019ll ride in her coach and wear black clothes!\u201d \u201cHow do you come here, child? What nonsense be ye talking! Go away, and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready!... Well, Tess ought to go to this other member of our family.

Yet in the interval since Crick\u2019s last view of them something had occurred which changed the pivot of the universe for their two natures; something which, had he known its quality, the dairyman would have despised, as a practical man; yet which was based upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of so-called practicalities. A veil had been whisked aside; the tract of each one\u2019s outlook was to have a new horizon thenceforward\u2014for a short time or for a long.

She drank a little milk as temporary refreshment\u2014to the surprise\u2014indeed, slight contempt\u2014of Dairyman Crick, to whose mind it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage. \u201cOh, if ye can swaller that, be it so,\u201d he said indifferently, while holding up the pail that she sipped from. \u201c\u2019Tis what I hain\u2019t touched for years\u2014not I. Rot the stuff; it would lie in my innerds like lead. You can try your hand upon she,\u201d he pursued, nodding to the nearest cow. \u201cNot but what she do milk rather hard. We\u2019ve hard ones and we\u2019ve easy ones, like other folks. However, you\u2019ll find out that soon enough.\u201d When Tess had changed her bonnet for a hood, and was really on her stool under the cow, and the milk was squirting from her fists into the pail, she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future.", " After Tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk in the barton, and not a sound interfered with the purr of the milk-jets into the numerous pails, except a momentary exclamation to one or other of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand still. The only movements were those of the milkers\u2019 hands up and down, and the swing of the cows\u2019 tails. Thus they all worked on, encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope of the valley\u2014a level landscape compounded of old landscapes long forgotten, and, no doubt, differing in character very greatly from the landscape they composed now. \u201cTo my thinking,\u201d said the dairyman, rising suddenly from a cow he had just finished off, snatching up his three-legged stool in one hand and the pail in the other, and moving on to the next hard-yielder in his vicinity, \u201cto my thinking, the cows don\u2019t gie down their milk to-day as usual.", " As the inimical plant could only be present in very microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before them. However, they formed themselves into line, all assisting, owing to the importance of the search; the dairyman at the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and the married dairywomen\u2014Beck Knibbs, with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps of the water-meads\u2014who lived in their respective cottages. With eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of the field, returning a little further down in such a manner that, when they should have finished, not a single inch of the pasture but would have fallen under the eye of some one of them. It was a most tedious business, not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being discoverable in the whole field; yet such was the herb\u2019s pungency that probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season the whole dairy\u2019s produce for the day.", " Her eyes vaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was given, as though she were nearly unconscious of what he did. \u201cNow the other side, for old acquaintance\u2019 sake.\u201d She turned her head in the same passive way, as one might turn at the request of a sketcher or hairdresser, and he kissed the other side, his lips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the skin of the mushrooms in the fields around. \u201cYou don\u2019t give me your mouth and kiss me back. You never willingly do that\u2014you\u2019ll never love me, I fear.\u201d \u201cI have said so, often. It is true. I have never really and truly loved you, and I think I never can.\u201d She added mournfully, \u201cPerhaps, of all things, a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now; but I have honour enough left, little as \u2019tis, not to tell that lie.

But the Vicar\u2019s view of that seat of learning as a stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men.", " Beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to suggest a _fiasco_, or that they were not going together to visit friends. Their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such solemn joy in each other a few days back, and as Clare wished to wind up his business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs Crick a call at the same time, unless she would excite suspicion of their unhappy state. To make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy-house, and descended the track on foot, side by side. The withy-bed had been cut, and they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had followed her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away behind the cow-stalls the mead which had been the scene of their first embrace.", " Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable flies and butterflies which, unable to escape, remained caged in the transparent tissue as in an aviary. Angel\u2019s eye at last fell upon Tess, the hindmost of the four; she, being full of suppressed laughter at their dilemma, could not help meeting his glance radiantly. He came beneath them in the water, which did not rise over his long boots; and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies. \u201cAre you trying to get to church?\u201d he said to Marian, who was in front, including the next two in his remark, but avoiding Tess. \u201cYes, sir; and \u2019tis getting late; and my colour do come up so\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll carry you through the pool\u2014every Jill of you.\u201d The whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them. \u201cI think you can\u2019t, sir,\u201d said Marian. \u201cIt is the only way for you to get past. Stand still. Nonsense\u2014you are not too heavy! I\u2019d carry you all four together.", " She don\u2019t know there is any such lady-relation yet.

Leave her to me.\u201d Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine prospects in store. \u201cTess is a fine figure o\u2019 fun, as I said to myself to-day when I zeed her vamping round parish with the rest,\u201d observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone. \u201cBut Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she don\u2019t get green malt in floor.\u201d It was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning, and there was no reply. The conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were heard crossing the room below."], "How do Marian, Izz, and Retty feel about Angel?": [" \u201cDon\u2019t push! You can see as well as I,\u201d said Retty, the auburn-haired and youngest girl, without removing her eyes from the window. \u201c\u2019Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me, Retty Priddle,\u201d said jolly-faced Marian, the eldest, slily. \u201cHis thoughts be of other cheeks than thine!\u201d Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again. \u201cThere he is again!\u201d cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp hair and keenly cut lips. \u201cYou needn\u2019t say anything, Izz,\u201d answered Retty. \u201cFor I zid you kissing his shade.\u201d _\u201dWhat_ did you see her doing?\u201d asked Marian. \u201cWhy\u2014he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was standing there filling a vat. She put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cO Izz Huett!\u201d said Marian. A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett\u2019s cheek.", " \u201cWell, there was no harm in it,\u201d she declared, with attempted coolness. \u201cAnd if I be in love wi\u2019en, so is Retty, too; and so be you, Marian, come to that.\u201d Marian\u2019s full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness. \u201cI!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a tale! Ah, there he is again! Dear eyes\u2014dear face\u2014dear Mr Clare!\u201d \u201cThere\u2014you\u2019ve owned it!\u201d \u201cSo have you\u2014so have we all,\u201d said Marian, with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion. \u201cIt is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would just marry \u2019n to-morrow!\u201d \u201cSo would I\u2014and more,\u201d murmured Izz Huett. \u201cAnd I too,\u201d whispered the more timid Retty. The listener grew warm. \u201cWe can\u2019t all marry him,\u201d said Izz. \u201cWe shan\u2019t, either of us; which is worse still,\u201d said the eldest. \u201cThere he is again!\u201d They all three blew him a silent kiss. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Retty quickly. \u201cBecause he likes Tess Durbeyfield best,\u201d said Marian, lowering her voice.", " Now, Marian, attend,\u201d he continued, \u201cand put your arms round my shoulders, so. Now! Hold on. That\u2019s well done.\u201d Marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed, and Angel strode off with her, his slim figure, as viewed from behind, looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers. They disappeared round the curve of the road, and only his sousing footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian\u2019s bonnet told where they were. In a few minutes he reappeared. Izz Huett was the next in order upon the bank. \u201cHere he comes,\u201d she murmured, and they could hear that her lips were dry with emotion. \u201cAnd I have to put my arms round his neck and look into his face as Marian did.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in that,\u201d said Tess quickly. \u201cThere\u2019s a time for everything,\u201d continued Izz, unheeding. \u201cA time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now going to be mine.\u201d \u201cFie\u2014it is Scripture, Izz!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Izz, \u201cI\u2019ve always a\u2019 ear at church for pretty verses.\u201d Angel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz.", " On Clare\u2019s return to his horse and gig, Izz jumped up beside him. \u201cI am going to leave England, Izz,\u201d he said, as they drove on. \u201cGoing to Brazil.\u201d \u201cAnd do Mrs Clare like the notion of such a journey?\u201d she asked. \u201cShe is not going at present\u2014say for a year or so.

I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever she may be. It is a queer business, apparently. Whether she has joined him yet or not I don\u2019t know; but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from him.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say. He never tells me anything nowadays. His ill-considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions.\u201d Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but she could not outwalk them without exciting notice. At last they outsped her altogether, and passed her by. The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned. Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands, and the three went on together. They soon reached the summit of the hill, and, evidently intending this point to be the limit of their promenade, slackened pace and turned all three aside to the gate whereat Tess had paused an hour before that time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it.", " Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges\u2014one sitting on each arm. \u201cAh, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?\u201d said Mrs d\u2019Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. \u201cI hope you will be kind to them.

And Phena too\u2014yes, they are a little frightened\u2014aren\u2019t you, dears? But they will soon get used to you.\u201d While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in obedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap, and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks, their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws. Her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and to discover if a single feather were crippled or draggled.", " I fear I could not conscientiously do so. I love the Church as one loves a parent. I shall always have the warmest affection for her. There is no institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration; but I cannot honestly be ordained her minister, as my brothers are, while she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry.\u201d It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this! He was stultified, shocked, paralysed. And if Angel were not going to enter the Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge? The University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume. He was a man not merely religious, but devout; a firm believer\u2014not as the phrase is now elusively construed by theological thimble-riggers in the Church and out of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school: one who could Indeed opine That the Eternal and Divine Did, eighteen centuries ago In very truth...

He had simply preached austerely at Angel for some time after. But the kindness of his heart was such that he never resented anything for long, and welcomed his son to-day with a smile which was as candidly sweet as a child\u2019s. Angel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet he did not so much as formerly feel himself one of the family gathered there.

I\u2019ll not allude to it again for a while.\u201d She again took up the shining skimmer, held it beneath the pump, and began anew. But she could not, as at other times, hit the exact under-surface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required, try as she might; sometimes she was cutting down into the milk, sometimes in the air. She could hardly see, her eyes having filled with two blurring tears drawn forth by a grief which, to this her best friend and dear advocate, she could never explain.", " See how I\u2019ve got to teave and slave, and your poor weak father with his heart clogged like a dripping-pan.

How a convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to answer him she could not say. But her poor foolish mother little knew her present feeling towards this man. Perhaps it was unusual in the circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and this, as she had said, was what made her detest herself. She had never wholly cared for him; she did not at all care for him now.", " Clare\u2019s shape appeared at the door. \u201cYou must not work like this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not my servant; you are my wife.\u201d She raised her eyes, and brightened somewhat. \u201cI may think myself that\u2014indeed?\u201d she murmured, in piteous raillery. \u201cYou mean in name! Well, I don\u2019t want to be anything more.\u201d \u201cYou _may_ think so, Tess! You are. What do you mean?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said hastily, with tears in her accents. \u201cI thought I\u2014because I am not respectable, I mean. I told you I thought I was not respectable enough long ago\u2014and on that account I didn\u2019t want to marry you, only\u2014only you urged me!\u201d She broke into sobs, and turned her back to him. It would almost have won round any man but Angel Clare.

Come to me\u2014come to me, and save me from what threatens me!\u2014 Your faithful heartbroken Tess XLIX The appeal duly found its way to the breakfast-table of the quiet Vicarage to the westward, in that valley where the air is so soft and the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb-Ash, and where to Tess the human world seemed so different (though it was much the same). It was purely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her communications through his father, whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart. \u201cNow,\u201d said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope, \u201cif Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his plans; for I believe it to be from his wife.\u201d He breathed deeply at the thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to Angel.", " An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry ways. This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless.", " Angel\u2019s companion was also an Englishman, bent on the same errand, though he came from another part of the island. They were both in a state of mental depression, and they spoke of home affairs. Confidence begat confidence. With that curious tendency evinced by men, more especially when in distant lands, to entrust to strangers details of their lives which they would on no account mention to friends, Angel admitted to this man as they rode along the sorrowful facts of his marriage. The stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more peoples than Angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the social norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the irregularities of vale and mountain-chain to the whole terrestrial curve. He viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel; thought that what Tess had been was of no importance beside what she would be, and plainly told Clare that he was wrong in coming away from her.", " If poor Tess was a servant here, as he feared, she would go to the back-door to that milkman, and he was inclined to go thither also. However, in his doubts he turned to the front, and rang. The hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door. Clare inquired for Teresa d\u2019Urberville or Durbeyfield. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though she had not adopted his name. \u201cWill you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?\u201d \u201cIt is rather early. What name shall I give, sir?\u201d \u201cAngel.\u201d \u201cMr Angel?\u201d \u201cNo; Angel. It is my Christian name.

Obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had feared, and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it."], "What does Angel think is Tess\u2019s reason for refusing to marry him?": [" She turned quite careworn. She had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon.

O, I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits! If you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her up for your own self!...", " His father then told him that, as he had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel himself unduly slighted. \u201cAs far as worldly wealth goes,\u201d continued his father, \u201cyou will no doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.\u201d This considerateness on old Mr Clare\u2019s part led Angel onward to the other and dearer subject. He observed to his father that he was then six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matters\u2014some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield. Would it not be well, therefore, for him to marry? His father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel put the question\u2014 \u201cWhat kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hard-working farmer?\u201d \u201cA truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in your goings-out and your comings-in."], "When Mr. Durbeyfield learns that Tess is going to marry Angel, what is his advice to Tess?": [" She had been even more struck with the look of the girls who followed Crick than abashed by Crick\u2019s blunt praise. After supper, when she reached her bedroom, they were all present. A light was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed, awaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts. But she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood. They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to have. Their condition was objective, contemplative. \u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her!\u201d murmured Retty, never taking eyes off Tess. \u201cHow her face do show it!\u201d \u201cYou _be_ going to marry him?\u201d asked Marian. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess. \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cSome day.\u201d They thought that this was evasiveness only. \u201c_Yes_\u2014going to _marry_ him\u2014a gentleman!\u201d repeated Izz Huett.

At the top Tess was going to be met with the spring-cart sent by the Stoke-d\u2019Urbervilles, and her box had already been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in readiness. Seeing their mother put on her bonnet, the younger children clamoured to go with her. \u201cI do want to walk a little-ways wi\u2019 Sissy, now she\u2019s going to marry our gentleman-cousin, and wear fine cloze!\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d said Tess, flushing and turning quickly, \u201cI\u2019ll hear no more o\u2019 that!

The beginning of November found its date still in abeyance, though he asked her at the most tempting times. But Tess\u2019s desire seemed to be for a perpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was then. The meads were changing now; but it was still warm enough in early afternoons before milking to idle there awhile, and the state of dairy-work at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling. Looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun, a glistening ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary, like the track of moonlight on the sea. Gnats, knowing nothing of their brief glorification, wandered across the shimmer of this pathway, irradiated as if they bore fire within them, then passed out of its line, and were quite extinct. In the presence of these things he would remind her that the date was still the question.", " They decided to go immediately after the wedding, and remain for a fortnight, instead of journeying to towns and inns. \u201cThen we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of London that I have heard of,\u201d he said, \u201cand by March or April we will pay a visit to my father and mother.\u201d Questions of procedure such as these arose and passed, and the day, the incredible day, on which she was to become his, loomed large in the near future. The thirty-first of December, New Year\u2019s Eve, was the date. His wife, she said to herself. Could it ever be? Their two selves together, nothing to divide them, every incident shared by them; why not? And yet why? One Sunday morning Izz Huett returned from church, and spoke privately to Tess. \u201cYou was not called home this morning.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cIt should ha\u2019 been the first time of asking to-day,\u201d she answered, looking quietly at Tess. \u201cYou meant to be married New Year\u2019s Eve, deary?\u201d The other returned a quick affirmative.", " However, Sir John, as we call \u2019n now, kept up the wedding-day as well as he could, and stood treat to everybody in the parish; and John\u2019s wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings. She asked the turnpike-keeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a while, and, on his offering no objection, she dismissed her carriage, and went on to the village alone by a back lane. At sight of her father\u2019s chimney she asked herself how she could possibly enter the house? Inside that cottage her relations were calmly supposing her far away on a wedding-tour with a comparatively rich man, who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity; while here she was, friendless, creeping up to the old door quite by herself, with no better place to go to in the world.", " \u201cOh yes; there\u2019s nothing like a fiddle,\u201d said the dairyman. \u201cThough I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows\u2014at least that\u2019s my experience. Once there was an old aged man over at Mellstock\u2014William Dewy by name\u2014one of the family that used to do a good deal of business as tranters over there\u2014Jonathan, do ye mind?\u2014I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in a manner of speaking. Well, this man was a coming home along from a wedding, where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight night, and for shortness\u2019 sake he took a cut across Forty-acres, a field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass. The bull seed William, and took after him, horns aground, begad; and though William runned his best, and hadn\u2019t _much_ drink in him (considering \u2019twas a wedding, and the folks well off), he found he\u2019d never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself."], "What does Angel do when a man from Alec d\u2019Urberville\u2019s village says that Tess is not a virgin?": [" XLIII There was no exaggeration in Marian\u2019s definition of Flintcomb-Ash farm as a starve-acre place. The single fat thing on the soil was Marian herself; and she was an importation. Of the three classes of village, the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other words, the village of a resident squire\u2019s tenantry, the village of free or copy-holders, and the absentee-owner\u2019s village, farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third. But Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel Clare; and it sustained her. The swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets\u2014the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes.", " I shall never forget it, never! \u2019Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn\u2019t find him nowhere at all.\u201d The dairyman paused, and one or two words of comment came from the listeners. Dairyman Crick\u2019s stories often seemed to be ended when they were not really so, and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of finality; though old friends knew better. The narrator went on\u2014 \u201cWell, how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could never tell, but she found out that he was inside that there churn. Without saying a word she took hold of the winch (it was turned by handpower then), and round she swung him, and Jack began to flop about inside. \u2018O Lard! stop the churn! let me out!\u2019 says he, popping out his head. \u2018I shall be churned into a pummy!\u2019 (He was a cowardly chap in his heart, as such men mostly be). \u2018Not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence!\u2019 says the old woman.", " \u201c\u2018At the present moment,\u2019 he says to your father, \u2018your heart is enclosed all round there, and all round there; this space is still open,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018As soon as it do meet, so,\u2019\u201d\u2014Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete\u2014\u201c\u2018off you will go like a shadder, Mr Durbeyfield,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.\u2019\u201d Tess looked alarmed.

He\u2019ll have to start shortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long.\u201d \u201cGet up his strength!\u201d said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to her eyes.", " Tess uttered a short little \u201cOh!\u201d And a moment after she said, quickly, \u201cI shall eat my dinner here\u2014right on the rick.\u201d Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack. The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d\u2019Urberville, the late Evangelist, despite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack\u2014now an oblong and level platform of sheaves."], "What ill omen occurs on the afternoon that Tess and Angel are leaving for the wedding ceremony?": [" She had consented. She might as well have agreed at first. The \u201cappetite for joy\u201d which pervades all creation, that tremendous force which sways humanity to its purpose, as the tide sways the helpless weed, was not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over the social rubric. \u201cI must write to my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind my doing that?\u201d \u201cOf course not, dear child.

It is rather dismal. It is that this sound of a non-existent coach can only be heard by one of d\u2019Urberville blood, and it is held to be of ill-omen to the one who hears it. It has to do with a murder, committed by one of the family, centuries ago.\u201d \u201cNow you have begun it, finish it.\u201d \u201cVery well.

Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further; she turned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears. Clare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had happened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of the disclosure itself. He waited patiently, apathetically, till the violence of her grief had worn itself out, and her rush of weeping had lessened to a catching gasp at intervals. \u201cAngel,\u201d she said suddenly, in her natural tones, the insane, dry voice of terror having left her now.", " One among her fellow-travellers addressed her more pointedly than any had spoken before: \u201cWhy, you be quite a posy! And such roses in early June!\u201d Then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised vision: roses at her breasts; roses in her hat; roses and strawberries in her basket to the brim. She blushed, and said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her. When the passengers were not looking she stealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed them in the basket, where she covered them with her handkerchief. Then she fell to reflecting again, and in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin. Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions; she thought this an ill omen\u2014the first she had noticed that day. The van travelled only so far as Shaston, and there were several miles of pedestrian descent from that mountain-town into the vale to Marlott."], "Where do Tess and Angel go to stay after the wedding?": [" \u201cI want to leave you, and go home.\u201d \u201cThen it shall be so.\u201d Though she did not look up at him, she started. There was a difference between the proposition and the covenant, which she had felt only too quickly. \u201cI feared it would come to this,\u201d she murmured, her countenance meekly fixed. \u201cI don\u2019t complain, Angel, I\u2014I think it best. What you said has quite convinced me. Yes, though nobody else should reproach me if we should stay together, yet somewhen, years hence, you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter, and knowing what you do of my bygones, you yourself might be tempted to say words, and they might be overheard, perhaps by my own children. O, what only hurts me now would torture and kill me then! I will go\u2014to-morrow.\u201d \u201cAnd I shall not stay here. Though I didn\u2019t like to initiate it, I have seen that it was advisable we should part\u2014at least for a while, till I can better see the shape that things have taken, and can write to you.\u201d Tess stole a glance at her husband.", " However, Sir John, as we call \u2019n now, kept up the wedding-day as well as he could, and stood treat to everybody in the parish; and John\u2019s wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings. She asked the turnpike-keeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a while, and, on his offering no objection, she dismissed her carriage, and went on to the village alone by a back lane. At sight of her father\u2019s chimney she asked herself how she could possibly enter the house? Inside that cottage her relations were calmly supposing her far away on a wedding-tour with a comparatively rich man, who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity; while here she was, friendless, creeping up to the old door quite by herself, with no better place to go to in the world.", " At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirt-sleeves and put his arm across the stairway. \u201cNow, Miss Flirt, before you go down,\u201d he said peremptorily. \u201cIt is a fortnight since I spoke, and this won\u2019t do any longer.

He observed to his father that he was then six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all matters\u2014some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst he was afield. Would it not be well, therefore, for him to marry?

It was purely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her communications through his father, whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart. \u201cNow,\u201d said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope, \u201cif Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his plans; for I believe it to be from his wife.\u201d He breathed deeply at the thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to Angel."], "Tess is so shamed by her revelation to Angel that she offers to ______.": [" Then, lest the flesh should again be weak, she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door. Her night was a broken one, as it well might be, and she listened for the first faint noise overhead. It came, as usual; he descended, as usual. She descended. He met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed her. Surely it was as warmly as ever! He looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought. But he said not a word to her about her revelation, even when they were alone. Could he have had it? Unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing. So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself. Yet he was frank and affectionate as before. Could it be that her doubts were childish? that he forgave her; that he loved her for what she was, just as she was, and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare? Had he really received her note?", " It was too much like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during intoxication. It just crossed her mind, too, that he might have a faint recollection of his tender vagary, and was disinclined to allude to it from a conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the opportunity it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go. He had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and soon after breakfast it arrived. She saw in it the beginning of the end\u2014the temporary end, at least, for the revelation of his tenderness by the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him. The luggage was put on the top, and the man drove them off, the miller and the old waiting-woman expressing some surprise at their precipitate departure, which Clare attributed to his discovery that the mill-work was not of the modern kind which he wished to investigate, a statement that was true so far as it went.", " But, before venturing to make the revelation, dubious Tess indirectly sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon Mr Clare, by asking the former if Mr Clare had any great respect for old county families when they had lost all their money and land. \u201cMr Clare,\u201d said the dairyman emphatically, \u201cis one of the most rebellest rozums you ever knowed\u2014not a bit like the rest of his family; and if there\u2019s one thing that he do hate more than another \u2019tis the notion of what\u2019s called a\u2019 old family. He says that it stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in past days, and can\u2019t have anything left in \u2019em now.

He asked his father if she had applied for any money during his absence. His father returned a negative, and then for the first time it occurred to Angel that her pride had stood in her way, and that she had suffered privation.

True, on his own account he cared very little about his career; but he had wished to make it at least a respectable one on account of his parents and brothers. And now as he looked into the candle its flame dumbly expressed to him that it was made to shine on sensible people, and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and a failure. When his agitation had cooled he would be at moments incensed with his poor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to practise deception on his parents.

Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this? But she could contest the point with him no further. She simply repeated after him his own words. \u201cUntil you come to me I must not try to come to you?\u201d \u201cJust so.\u201d \u201cMay I write to you?\u201d \u201cO yes\u2014if you are ill, or want anything at all.

It was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad. But, anyhow, here was this deserted wife of his, this passionately-fond woman, clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything to her but a protector. He saw that for him to be otherwise was not, in her mind, within the region of the possible. Tenderness was absolutely dominant in Clare at last. He kissed her endlessly with his white lips, and held her hand, and said\u2014 \u201cI will not desert you! I will protect you by every means in my power, dearest love, whatever you may have done or not have done!\u201d They then walked on under the trees, Tess turning her head every now and then to look at him.

She attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural severity. But he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of him, she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note; laughing distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that she had laughed.

The single fat thing on the soil was Marian herself; and she was an importation. Of the three classes of village, the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other words, the village of a resident squire\u2019s tenantry, the village of free or copy-holders, and the absentee-owner\u2019s village, farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third. But Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel Clare; and it sustained her. The swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets\u2014the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes.", " She followed one of the mug\u2019s journeys upward, and perceived it to be clasped by hands whose owner she well knew. Tess went towards the waggon. \u201cMarian and Izz!\u201d she cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting with the moving family at whose house they had lodged. \u201cAre you house-ridding to-day, like everybody else?\u201d They were, they said. It had been too rough a life for them at Flintcomb-Ash, and they had come away, almost without notice, leaving Groby to prosecute them if he chose. They told Tess their destination, and Tess told them hers. Marian leant over the load, and lowered her voice. \u201cDo you know that the gentleman who follows \u2019ee\u2014you\u2019ll guess who I mean\u2014came to ask for \u2019ee at Flintcomb after you had gone?

The women on the corn-rick\u2014Marian, who was one of them, in particular\u2014could stop to drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then, or to exchange a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the fragments of straw and husk from their clothing; but for Tess there was no respite; for, as the drum never stopped, the man who fed it could not stop, and she, who had to supply the man with untied sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places with her, which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby\u2019s objections that she was too slow-handed for a feeder. For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was chosen for this particular duty, and Groby gave as his motive in selecting Tess that she was one of those who best combined strength with quickness in untying, and both with staying power, and this may have been true.", " But now that she was stung to a fever by Izz\u2019s tale, there was a limit to her powers of renunciation. Why had her husband not written to her? He had distinctly implied that he would at least let her know of the locality to which he had journeyed; but he had not sent a line to notify his address. Was he really indifferent? But was he ill? Was it for her to make some advance? Surely she might summon the courage of solicitude, call at the Vicarage for intelligence, and express her grief at his silence. If Angel\u2019s father were the good man she had heard him represented to be, he would be able to enter into her heart-starved situation. Her social hardships she could conceal. To leave the farm on a week-day was not in her power; Sunday was the only possible opportunity. Flintcomb-Ash being in the middle of the cretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as yet, it would be necessary to walk."], "What items of Tess\u2019s do the Clares find, assuming that they belong to a peasant?": [" \u201cAngel!\u2014Angel!

I can take you if you wish for a lift.\u201d Her olive complexion grew richer in hue. \u201cThank \u2019ee, Mr Clare,\u201d she said. He soon found the farmer, and settled the account for his rent and the few other items which had to be considered by reason of the sudden abandonment of the lodgings.", " One may, indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess d\u2019Urberville\u2019s mailed ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time. But though to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; and it therefore does not mend the matter. As Tess\u2019s own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying among each other in their fatalistic way: \u201cIt was to be.\u201d There lay the pity of it.

A milkmaid\u2019s. It was amazing, indeed, to find how great a matter the life of the obscure dairy had become to him. And though new love was to be held partly responsible for this, it was not solely so. Many besides Angel have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their external displacements, but as to their subjective experiences. The impressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life than the pachydermatous king. Looking at it thus, he found that life was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere. Despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with a conscience. Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss; but a woman living her precious life\u2014a life which, to herself who endured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension as the life of the mightiest to himself. Upon her sensations the whole world depended to Tess; through her existence all her fellow-creatures existed, to her."], "What does Tess feel when Alec preaches about his religious conversion?": [" Out upon such\u2014I don\u2019t believe in you\u2014I hate it!\u201d \u201cTess,\u201d he insisted; \u201cdon\u2019t speak so!

It expressed Mr Clare\u2019s warm assurance of forgiveness for d\u2019Urberville\u2019s former conduct and his interest in the young man\u2019s plans for the future. He, Mr Clare, would much have liked to see d\u2019Urberville in the Church to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life, and would have helped him to enter a theological college to that end; but since his correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account of the delay it would have entailed, he was not the man to insist upon its paramount importance. Every man must work as he could best work, and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the Spirit. D\u2019Urberville read and re-read this letter, and seemed to quiz himself cynically. He also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till his face assumed a calm, and apparently the image of Tess no longer troubled his mind.", " While slowly breasting this ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her, and turning she saw approaching that well-known form\u2014so strangely accoutred as the Methodist\u2014the one personage in all the world she wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave. There was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and she yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake her. She saw that he was excited, less by the speed of his walk than by the feelings within him. \u201cTess!\u201d he said. She slackened speed without looking round. \u201cTess!\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt is I\u2014Alec d\u2019Urberville.\u201d She then looked back at him, and he came up. \u201cI see it is,\u201d she answered coldly. \u201cWell\u2014is that all? Yet I deserve no more! Of course,\u201d he added, with a slight laugh, \u201cthere is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in seeing me like this. But\u2014I must put up with that.... I heard you had gone away; nobody knew where.", " Tess uttered a short little \u201cOh!\u201d And a moment after she said, quickly, \u201cI shall eat my dinner here\u2014right on the rick.\u201d Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack. The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d\u2019Urberville, the late Evangelist, despite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack\u2014now an oblong and level platform of sheaves.", " \u201cWhere is Tess?\u201d he asked. Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the direction of the church, and went on, d\u2019Urberville saying that he would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone, d\u2019Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot. In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead, remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall. The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first time in her life. Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff."], "When Alec proposes to Tess in the fields, where does he suggest they go to become missionaries?": [" I long for only one thing in heaven or earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own dear! Come to me\u2014come to me, and save me from what threatens me!\u2014 Your faithful heartbroken Tess XLIX The appeal duly found its way to the breakfast-table of the quiet Vicarage to the westward, in that valley where the air is so soft and the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb-Ash, and where to Tess the human world seemed so different (though it was much the same). It was purely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her communications through his father, whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart. \u201cNow,\u201d said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope, \u201cif Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his plans; for I believe it to be from his wife.\u201d He breathed deeply at the thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to Angel.", " She don\u2019t know there is any such lady-relation yet. But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage, and she won\u2019t say nay to going.\u201d \u201cTess is queer.\u201d \u201cBut she\u2019s tractable at bottom. Leave her to me.\u201d Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine prospects in store. \u201cTess is a fine figure o\u2019 fun, as I said to myself to-day when I zeed her vamping round parish with the rest,\u201d observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone. \u201cBut Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she don\u2019t get green malt in floor.\u201d It was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning, and there was no reply. The conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were heard crossing the room below.", " Beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to suggest a _fiasco_, or that they were not going together to visit friends. Their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such solemn joy in each other a few days back, and as Clare wished to wind up his business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs Crick a call at the same time, unless she would excite suspicion of their unhappy state. To make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy-house, and descended the track on foot, side by side. The withy-bed had been cut, and they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had followed her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away behind the cow-stalls the mead which had been the scene of their first embrace.", " Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved by the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition than at first; though she had dimly heard of the separation. \u201cTess\u2014Mrs Clare\u2014the dear wife of dear he! And is it really so bad as this, my child? Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way? Anybody been beating \u2019ee? Not _he_?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no!

The truth is, I don\u2019t care anything about my looks; and so I didn\u2019t put it on.\u201d \u201cAnd you don\u2019t wear your wedding-ring?\u201d \u201cYes, I do; but not in public. I wear it round my neck on a ribbon. I don\u2019t wish people to think who I am by marriage, or that I am married at all; it would be so awkward while I lead my present life.\u201d Marian paused."], "When Alec says that Angel is neglecting Tess, what does Tess strike Alec with?": [" Tess uttered a short little \u201cOh!\u201d And a moment after she said, quickly, \u201cI shall eat my dinner here\u2014right on the rick.\u201d Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack.

Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, laughing; \u201cI am sorry to wound you.", " She talked so little, and the other maids talked so much, that the babble did not strike him as possessing a new note, and he was ever in the habit of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general impression. One day, however, when he had been conning one of his music-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in his head, he lapsed into listlessness, and the music-sheet rolled to the hearth. He looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast-cooking and boiling, and it seemed to jig to his inward tune; also at the two chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterel, or cross-bar, plumed with soot, which quivered to the same melody; also at the half-empty kettle whining an accompaniment. The conversation at the table mixed in with his phantasmal orchestra till he thought: \u201cWhat a fluty voice one of those milkmaids has!", " \u201c\u2018At the present moment,\u2019 he says to your father, \u2018your heart is enclosed all round there, and all round there; this space is still open,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018As soon as it do meet, so,\u2019\u201d\u2014Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete\u2014\u201c\u2018off you will go like a shadder, Mr Durbeyfield,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.\u2019\u201d Tess looked alarmed.

He do want to get up his strength for his journey to-morrow with that load of beehives, which must be delivered, family or no. He\u2019ll have to start shortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long.\u201d \u201cGet up his strength!\u201d said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to her eyes."], "Who forwards Tess\u2019s letter to Angel in Brazil?": [" A day or two passed while he waited at his father\u2019s house for the promised second note from Joan Durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover a little more strength. The strength showed signs of coming back, but there was no sign of Joan\u2019s letter. Then he hunted up the old letter sent on to him in Brazil, which Tess had written from Flintcomb-Ash, and re-read it. The sentences touched him now as much as when he had first perused them. ...I must cry to you in my trouble\u2014I have no one else!... I think I must die if you do not come soon, or tell me to come to you... please, please, not to be just\u2014only a little kind to me.... If you would come, I could die in your arms! I would be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me!... if you will send me one little line, and say, _I am coming soon_, I will bide on, Angel\u2014O, so cheerfully!... think how it do hurt my heart not to see you ever\u2014ever!", " His father and mother were both in the drawing-room, but neither of his brothers was now at home.

Of course it was best that none of us should be present, especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy, and not at her home, wherever that may be.", " Angel\u2019s original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a northern or eastern farm in his own country. He had come to this place in a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape from his past existence. During this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years. What arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its pathos. Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism, he now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality. He thought they wanted readjusting. Who was the moral man? Still more pertinently, who was the moral woman? The beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only in its achievements, but in its aims and impulses; its true history lay, not among things done, but among things willed. How, then, about Tess? Viewing her in these lights, a regret for his hasty judgement began to oppress him.", " Brazil somewhat attracted him as a new idea. Tess could eventually join him there, and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem impracticable to him here. In brief he was strongly inclined to try Brazil, especially as the season for going thither was just at hand. With this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan to his parents, and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated them. As he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face, just as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks; but his face was thinner now. Clare had given his parents no warning of his visit, and his arrival stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher stirs a quiet pool."], "Who brings word that Tess\u2019s mother is dying?": [" O yes, I have lost him now\u2014again because of\u2014you!\u201d In writhing, with her head on the chair, she turned her face towards the door, and Mrs Brooks could see the pain upon it, and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth upon them, and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet tags to her cheeks. She continued: \u201cAnd he is dying\u2014he looks as if he is dying!... And my sin will kill him and not kill me!... O, you have torn my life all to pieces ... made me be what I prayed you in pity not to make me be again!...

Little Abraham was aroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment, and made to put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world.", " \u201cHe was a very splendid lover, no doubt,\u201d she said; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he is a too fond husband to go away from you so soon.\u201d \u201cHe had to go\u2014he was obliged to go, to see about the land over there!\u201d pleaded Tess. \u201cHe might have tided \u2019ee over the winter.\u201d \u201cAh\u2014that\u2019s owing to an accident\u2014a misunderstanding; and we won\u2019t argue it,\u201d Tess answered, with tearfulness in her words. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s a good deal to be said for him! He did not go away, like some husbands, without telling me; and I can always find out where he is.\u201d After this they continued for some long time in a reverie, as they went on seizing the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering it under their arms, and cutting off the ears with their bill-hooks, nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the hook. Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon the heap of wheat-ears at her feet. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it!\u201d cried Marian.", " \u201cThere!\u201d said Marian. \u201cNow I wish I hadn\u2019t told \u2019ee!\u201d \u201cNo. It is a very good thing that you have done!

I have been very wrong and neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him!\u201d The dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and they could see to work no longer. When Tess had reached home that evening, and had entered into the privacy of her little white-washed chamber, she began impetuously writing a letter to Clare. But falling into doubt, she could not finish it. Afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on which she wore it next her heart, and retained it on her finger all night, as if to fortify herself in the sensation that she was really the wife of this elusive lover of hers, who could propose that Izz should go with him abroad, so shortly after he had left her."], "When Angel returns for Tess, where does he learn that she is staying?": [" \u201cI want to see her at once,\u201d he added. \u201cYou said you would write to me again, but you have not done so.\u201d \u201cBecause she\u2019ve not come home,\u201d said Joan. \u201cDo you know if she is well?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t.

Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?\u201d Tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young man was pressing, and she consented to accompany him. He conducted her about the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence to the fruit-garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked strawberries. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess, \u201cwhen they come.\u201d \u201cThey are already here.\u201d D\u2019Urberville began gathering specimens of the fruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and, presently, selecting a specially fine product of the \u201cBritish Queen\u201d variety, he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth.", " \u201cHe\u2019s tired, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said hastily, \u201cand he has got a lift home, because our own horse has to rest to-day.\u201d \u201cBless thy simplicity, Tess,\u201d said her companions. \u201cHe\u2019s got his market-nitch. Haw-haw!\u201d \u201cLook here; I won\u2019t walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes about him!\u201d Tess cried, and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her face and neck. In a moment her eyes grew moist, and her glance drooped to the ground. Perceiving that they had really pained her they said no more, and order again prevailed. Tess\u2019s pride would not allow her to turn her head again, to learn what her father\u2019s meaning was, if he had any; and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where there was to be dancing on the green. By the time the spot was reached she had recovered her equanimity, and tapped her neighbour with her wand and talked as usual. Tess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion untinctured by experience.", " I thought you might be back here again.\u201d This was a girl whose secret he had guessed, but who had not yet guessed his; an honest girl who loved him\u2014one who would have made as good, or nearly as good, a practical farmer\u2019s wife as Tess. \u201cI am here alone,\u201d he said; \u201cwe are not living here now.\u201d Explaining why he had come, he asked, \u201cWhich way are you going home, Izz?\u201d \u201cI have no home at Talbothays Dairy now, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d Izz looked down. \u201cIt was so dismal there that I left!

I can take you if you wish for a lift.\u201d Her olive complexion grew richer in hue. \u201cThank \u2019ee, Mr Clare,\u201d she said.

She thought, without exactly wording the thought, how strange and god-like was a composer\u2019s power, who from the grave could lead through sequences of emotion, which he alone had felt at first, a girl like her who had never heard of his name, and never would have a clue to his personality. The people who had turned their heads turned them again as the service proceeded; and at last observing her, they whispered to each other. She knew what their whispers were about, grew sick at heart, and felt that she could come to church no more. The bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her retreat more continually than ever. Here, under her few square yards of thatch, she watched winds, and snows, and rains, gorgeous sunsets, and successive moons at their full.", " He would become an American or Australian Abraham, commanding like a monarch his flocks and his herds, his spotted and his ring-straked, his men-servants and his maids. At times, nevertheless, it did seem unaccountable to her that a decidedly bookish, musical, thinking young man should have chosen deliberately to be a farmer, and not a clergyman, like his father and brothers. Thus, neither having the clue to the other\u2019s secret, they were respectively puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge of each other\u2019s character and mood without attempting to pry into each other\u2019s history. Every day, every hour, brought to him one more little stroke of her nature, and to her one more of his. Tess was trying to lead a repressed life, but she little divined the strength of her own vitality. At first Tess seemed to regard Angel Clare as an intelligence rather than as a man. As such she compared him with herself; and at every discovery of the abundance of his illuminations, of the distance between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, Andean altitude of his, she became quite dejected, disheartened from all further effort on her own part whatever.", " Tess uttered a short little \u201cOh!\u201d And a moment after she said, quickly, \u201cI shall eat my dinner here\u2014right on the rick.\u201d Sometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did this; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the rest descended, and sat under the straw-stack. The newcomer was, indeed, Alec d\u2019Urberville, the late Evangelist, despite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that the original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as nearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to the old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her admirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack\u2014now an oblong and level platform of sheaves.", " She accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and stood at the door of the front room\u2014a drawing-room, connected with the room immediately behind it (which was a bedroom) by folding-doors in the common manner. This first floor, containing Mrs Brooks\u2019s best apartments, had been taken by the week by the d\u2019Urbervilles. The back room was now in silence; but from the drawing-room there came sounds. All that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable, continually repeated in a low note of moaning, as if it came from a soul bound to some Ixionian wheel\u2014 \u201cO\u2014O\u2014O!\u201d Then a silence, then a heavy sigh, and again\u2014 \u201cO\u2014O\u2014O!\u201d The landlady looked through the keyhole. Only a small space of the room inside was visible, but within that space came a corner of the breakfast table, which was already spread for the meal, and also a chair beside. Over the seat of the chair Tess\u2019s face was bowed, her posture being a kneeling one in front of it; her hands were clasped over her head, the skirts of her dressing-gown and the embroidery of her night-gown flowed upon the floor behind her, and her stockingless feet, from which the slippers had fallen, protruded upon the carpet."], "Where is Tess when she is finally arrested?": [" \u201cOh\u2014that\u2019s all!\u201d said Tess. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t expect her to throw her arms round \u2019ee, an\u2019 to kiss and to coll \u2019ee all at once.\u201d Tess looked out of the window. \u201cI would rather stay here with father and you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather not tell you why, mother; indeed, I don\u2019t quite know why.\u201d A week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood. Her idea had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to purchase another horse. Hardly had she crossed the threshold before one of the children danced across the room, saying, \u201cThe gentleman\u2019s been here!\u201d Her mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of her person. Mrs d\u2019Urberville\u2019s son had called on horseback, having been riding by chance in the direction of Marlott. He had wished to know, finally, in the name of his mother, if Tess could really come to manage the old lady\u2019s fowl-farm or not; the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy.", " Let me see.\u201d He pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn, and put it round her tenderly. \u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014now you\u2019ll feel warmer,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, my pretty, rest there; I shall soon be back again.\u201d Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees. She could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining slope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird, and finally died away. With the setting of the moon the pale light lessened, and Tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had left her. In the meantime Alec d\u2019Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in. He had, in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any turning that came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her, and giving far more attention to Tess\u2019s moonlit person than to any wayside object.", " Angel\u2019s original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a northern or eastern farm in his own country. He had come to this place in a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape from his past existence. During this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years. What arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its pathos. Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism, he now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality. He thought they wanted readjusting. Who was the moral man? Still more pertinently, who was the moral woman? The beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only in its achievements, but in its aims and impulses; its true history lay, not among things done, but among things willed. How, then, about Tess? Viewing her in these lights, a regret for his hasty judgement began to oppress him.", " In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice. They said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would not object to see her. Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now. He felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents were, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as middle-class people, which it would require some tact to overcome. For though legally at liberty to do as he chose, and though their daughter-in-law\u2019s qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives, in the probability of her living far away from them, he wished for affection\u2019s sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important decision of his life."], "Who does Tess hope that Angel will marry?": [" See how I\u2019ve got to teave and slave, and your poor weak father with his heart clogged like a dripping-pan. I did hope for something to come out o\u2019 this! To see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove away together four months ago! See what he has given us\u2014all, as we thought, because we were his kin. But if he\u2019s not, it must have been done because of his love for \u2019ee. And yet you\u2019ve not got him to marry!\u201d Get Alec d\u2019Urberville in the mind to marry her! He marry _her_! On matrimony he had never once said a word. And what if he had? How a convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to answer him she could not say. But her poor foolish mother little knew her present feeling towards this man. Perhaps it was unusual in the circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and this, as she had said, was what made her detest herself. She had never wholly cared for him; she did not at all care for him now.", " She turned quite careworn. She had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon. With pain that was like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman. \u201cO Mr Clare\u2014I cannot be your wife\u2014I cannot be!\u201d The sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess\u2019s very heart, and she bowed her face in her grief. \u201cBut, Tess!\u201d he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more greedily close. \u201cDo you say no? Surely you love me?\u201d \u201cO yes, yes! And I would rather be yours than anybody\u2019s in the world,\u201d returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl. \u201cBut I _cannot_ marry you!\u201d \u201cTess,\u201d he said, holding her at arm\u2019s length, \u201cyou are engaged to marry some one else!\u201d \u201cNo, no!\u201d \u201cThen why do you refuse me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry!", " \u201cIt is so solemn and lonely\u2014after my great happiness\u2014with nothing but the sky above my face. It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two; and I wish there were not\u2014except \u2019Liza-Lu.\u201d Clare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little lighter, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and sat down by her side. \u201cAngel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over \u2019Liza-Lu for my sake?\u201d she asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind among the pillars. \u201cI will.\u201d \u201cShe is so good and simple and pure. O, Angel\u2014I wish you would marry her if you lose me, as you will do shortly. O, if you would!\u201d \u201cIf I lose you I lose all! And she is my sister-in-law.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, dearest. People marry sister-laws continually about Marlott; and \u2019Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she is growing so beautiful. O, I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits! If you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her up for your own self!...", " What an awakening for them! What a prospect! Can you honestly say \u2018Remain\u2019 after contemplating this contingency? Don\u2019t you think we had better endure the ills we have than fly to others?\u201d Her eyelids, weighted with trouble, continued drooping as before. \u201cI cannot say \u2018Remain,\u2019\u201d she answered, \u201cI cannot; I had not thought so far.\u201d Tess\u2019s feminine hope\u2014shall we confess it?\u2014had been so obstinately recuperative as to revive in her surreptitious visions of a domiciliary intimacy continued long enough to break down his coldness even against his judgement. Though unsophisticated in the usual sense, she was not incomplete; and it would have denoted deficiency of womanhood if she had not instinctively known what an argument lies in propinquity. Nothing else would serve her, she knew, if this failed. It was wrong to hope in what was of the nature of strategy, she said to herself: yet that sort of hope she could not extinguish."], "What tells Angel and Tess\u2019s sister that Tess has been executed?": [" \u201cIt is so solemn and lonely\u2014after my great happiness\u2014with nothing but the sky above my face.

I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever she may be. It is a queer business, apparently. Whether she has joined him yet or not I don\u2019t know; but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from him.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say. He never tells me anything nowadays. His ill-considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions.\u201d Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but she could not outwalk them without exciting notice. At last they outsped her altogether, and passed her by. The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned. Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands, and the three went on together. They soon reached the summit of the hill, and, evidently intending this point to be the limit of their promenade, slackened pace and turned all three aside to the gate whereat Tess had paused an hour before that time to reconnoitre the town before descending into it.", " Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges\u2014one sitting on each arm. \u201cAh, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?\u201d said Mrs d\u2019Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. \u201cI hope you will be kind to them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person. Well, where are they? Ah, this is Strut! But he is hardly so lively to-day, is he? He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger, I suppose. And Phena too\u2014yes, they are a little frightened\u2014aren\u2019t you, dears? But they will soon get used to you.\u201d While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in obedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap, and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks, their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws. Her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and to discover if a single feather were crippled or draggled.", " \u201cThat our great relation will help \u2019ee to marry a gentleman.\u201d \u201cI? Our great relation? We have no such relation. What has put that into your head?\u201d \u201cI heard \u2019em talking about it up at Rolliver\u2019s when I went to find father. There\u2019s a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge, and mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady, she\u2019d put \u2019ee in the way of marrying a gentleman.\u201d His sister became abruptly still, and lapsed into a pondering silence. Abraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance than for audition, so that his sister\u2019s abstraction was of no account. He leant back against the hives, and with upturned face made observations on the stars, whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above, in serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life. He asked how far away those twinklers were, and whether God was on the other side of them. But ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation."]}
