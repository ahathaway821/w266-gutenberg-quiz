{"Why does Tess take the job at the d\u2019Urberville estate?": [" Round about were deparked hills and slopes\u2014now cut up into little paddocks\u2014and the green foundations that showed where the d\u2019Urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate. Hard by, the aisle of the church called the d\u2019Urberville Aisle looked on imperturbably. \u201cIsn\u2019t your family vault your own freehold?\u201d said Tess\u2019s mother, as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. \u201cWhy, of course \u2019tis, and that\u2019s where we will camp, girls, till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof! Now, Tess and \u2019Liza and Abraham, you help me. We\u2019ll make a nest for these children, and then we\u2019ll have another look round.\u201d Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building known as the d\u2019Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay. Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of many lights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called the d\u2019Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield\u2019s old seal and spoon. Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it, and put the smaller children inside. \u201cIf it comes to the worst we can sleep there too, for one night,\u201d she said.", " She had come from the manor-house. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville wants the fowls as usual,\u201d she said; but perceiving that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, \u201cMis\u2019ess is a old lady, and blind.\u201d \u201cBlind!\u201d said Tess. Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took, under her companion\u2019s direction, two of the most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures\u2014feathers floating within view of the front, and hen-coops standing on the grass. In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a white-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a large cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges\u2014one sitting on each arm. \u201cAh, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?\u201d said Mrs d\u2019Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. \u201cI hope you will be kind to them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person.", " Against the twilight rises the trapezoidal top of the stack, which has stood forlornly here through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather. When Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a rustling denoted that others had preceded them; to which, as the light increased, there were presently added the silhouettes of two men on the summit. They were busily \u201cunhaling\u201d the rick, that is, stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the sheaves; and while this was in progress Izz and Tess, with the other women-workers, in their whitey-brown pinners, stood waiting and shivering, Farmer Groby having insisted upon their being on the spot thus early to get the job over if possible by the end of the day. Close under the eaves of the stack, and as yet barely visible, was the red tyrant that the women had come to serve\u2014a timber-framed construction, with straps and wheels appertaining\u2014the threshing-machine which, whilst it was going, kept up a despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves. A little way off there was another indistinct figure; this one black, with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve. The long chimney running up beside an ash-tree, and the warmth which radiated from the spot, explained without the necessity of much daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the _primum mobile_ of this little world.", " They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and here they shared their first common meal alone. Such was their childishness, or rather his, that he found it interesting to use the same bread-and-butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her lips with his own. He wondered a little that she did not enter into these frivolities with his own zest. Looking at her silently for a long time; \u201cShe is a dear dear Tess,\u201d he thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of a difficult passage. \u201cDo I realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune? I think not. I think I could not, unless I were a woman myself. What I am in worldly estate, she is. What I become, she must become. What I cannot be, she cannot be. And shall I ever neglect her, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her? God forbid such a crime!\u201d They sat on over the tea-table waiting for their luggage, which the dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark. But evening began to close in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought nothing more than they stood in. With the departure of the sun the calm mood of the winter day changed. Out of doors there began noises as of silk smartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection, and whirled about unwillingly, and tapped against the shutters."], "What does Tess name her son?": [" Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o\u2019clock he entered and went to bed. Before putting out his light he re-read Tess\u2019s impassioned letter. Sleep, however, he could not\u2014so near her, yet so far from her\u2014and he continually lifted the window-blind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses, and wondered behind which of the sashes she reposed at that moment. He might almost as well have sat up all night. In the morning he arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of the chief post-office. At the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with letters for the morning delivery. \u201cDo you know the address of a Mrs Clare?\u201d asked Angel. The postman shook his head. Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name, Clare said\u2014 \u201cOf a Miss Durbeyfield?\u201d \u201cDurbeyfield?\u201d This also was strange to the postman addressed. \u201cThere\u2019s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cand without the name of the house \u2019tis impossible to find \u2019em.\u201d One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated to him. \u201cI know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d\u2019Urberville at The Herons,\u201d said the second. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation. \u201cWhat place is The Herons?\u201d \u201cA stylish lodging-house. \u2019Tis all lodging-houses here, bless \u2019ee.\u201d Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither, arriving with the milkman.", " The kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealed\u2014the stubble scratches upon her wrists, and the weariness of her eyes\u2014her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing, showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity which was almost regal. The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy eyes blinking and red, awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active. The most impressed of them said: \u201cBe you really going to christen him, Tess?\u201d The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name going to be?\u201d She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service, and now she pronounced it: \u201cSORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d She sprinkled the water, and there was silence. \u201cSay \u2018Amen,\u2019 children.\u201d The tiny voices piped in obedient response, \u201cAmen!\u201d Tess went on: \u201cWe receive this child\u201d\u2014and so forth\u2014\u201cand do sign him with the sign of the Cross.\u201d Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life\u2019s end.", " The Herons, though an ordinary villa, stood in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place in which one would have expected to find lodgings, so private was its appearance. If poor Tess was a servant here, as he feared, she would go to the back-door to that milkman, and he was inclined to go thither also. However, in his doubts he turned to the front, and rang. The hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door. Clare inquired for Teresa d\u2019Urberville or Durbeyfield. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though she had not adopted his name. \u201cWill you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?\u201d \u201cIt is rather early. What name shall I give, sir?\u201d \u201cAngel.\u201d \u201cMr Angel?\u201d \u201cNo; Angel. It is my Christian name. She\u2019ll understand.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see if she is awake.\u201d He was shown into the front room\u2014the dining-room\u2014and looked out through the spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons and other shrubs upon it. Obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had feared, and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it. He did not blame her for one moment. Soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the stairs, at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly stand firm. \u201cDear me! what will she think of me, so altered as I am!\u201d he said to himself; and the door opened.", " I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of your name to d\u2019Urberville, and trace the manifest corruption. And this was the carking secret!\u201d She had not told. At the last moment her courage had failed her; she feared his blame for not telling him sooner; and her instinct of self-preservation was stronger than her candour. \u201cOf course,\u201d continued the unwitting Clare, \u201cI should have been glad to know you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering, dumb, unrecorded rank and file of the English nation, and not from the self-seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the rest. But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you, Tess (he laughed as he spoke), and made selfish likewise. For your own sake I rejoice in your descent. Society is hopelessly snobbish, and this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its acceptance of you as my wife, after I have made you the well-read woman that I mean to make you. My mother too, poor soul, will think so much better of you on account of it. Tess, you must spell your name correctly\u2014d\u2019Urberville\u2014from this very day.\u201d \u201cI like the other way rather best.\u201d \u201cBut you _must_, dearest! Good heavens, why dozens of mushroom millionaires would jump at such a possession! By the bye, there\u2019s one of that kidney who has taken the name\u2014where have I heard of him?\u2014Up in the neighbourhood of The Chase, I think."], "Who is giving the barn sermon that Tess stops in to hear?": [" The cottage by the church, in which she again sat down, was almost the first at that end of the village, and while the woman fetched her some milk from the pantry, Tess, looking down the street, perceived that the place seemed quite deserted. \u201cThe people are gone to afternoon service, I suppose?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, my dear,\u201d said the old woman. \u201c\u2019Tis too soon for that; the bells hain\u2019t strook out yet. They be all gone to hear the preaching in yonder barn. A ranter preaches there between the services\u2014an excellent, fiery, Christian man, they say. But, Lord, I don\u2019t go to hear\u2019n! What comes in the regular way over the pulpit is hot enough for I.\u201d Tess soon went onward into the village, her footsteps echoing against the houses as though it were a place of the dead. Nearing the central part, her echoes were intruded on by other sounds; and seeing the barn not far off the road, she guessed these to be the utterances of the preacher. His voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could soon catch his sentences, though she was on the closed side of the barn. The sermon, as might be expected, was of the extremest antinomian type; on justification by faith, as expounded in the theology of St Paul. This fixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered with animated enthusiasm, in a manner entirely declamatory, for he had plainly no skill as a dialectician. Although Tess had not heard the beginning of the address, she learnt what the text had been from its constant iteration\u2014 \u201cO foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?\u201d Tess was all the more interested, as she stood listening behind, in finding that the preacher\u2019s doctrine was a vehement form of the view of Angel\u2019s father, and her interest intensified when the speaker began to detail his own spiritual experiences of how he had come by those views.", " \u201cHe was a very splendid lover, no doubt,\u201d she said; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he is a too fond husband to go away from you so soon.\u201d \u201cHe had to go\u2014he was obliged to go, to see about the land over there!\u201d pleaded Tess. \u201cHe might have tided \u2019ee over the winter.\u201d \u201cAh\u2014that\u2019s owing to an accident\u2014a misunderstanding; and we won\u2019t argue it,\u201d Tess answered, with tearfulness in her words. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s a good deal to be said for him! He did not go away, like some husbands, without telling me; and I can always find out where he is.\u201d After this they continued for some long time in a reverie, as they went on seizing the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering it under their arms, and cutting off the ears with their bill-hooks, nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the hook. Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon the heap of wheat-ears at her feet. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it!\u201d cried Marian. \u201cIt wants harder flesh than yours for this work.\u201d Just then the farmer entered. \u201cOh, that\u2019s how you get on when I am away,\u201d he said to her. \u201cBut it is my own loss,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cNot yours.\u201d \u201cI want it finished,\u201d he said doggedly, as he crossed the barn and went out at the other door. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2019ee mind him, there\u2019s a dear,\u201d said Marian. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here before. Now you go and lie down there, and Izz and I will make up your number.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like to let you do that.", " As soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would allow her to stir, her impulse was to pass on out of his sight. He had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun. But the moment that she moved again he recognized her. The effect upon her old lover was electric, far stronger than the effect of his presence upon her. His fire, the tumultuous ring of his eloquence, seemed to go out of him. His lip struggled and trembled under the words that lay upon it; but deliver them it could not as long as she faced him. His eyes, after their first glance upon her face, hung confusedly in every other direction but hers, but came back in a desperate leap every few seconds. This paralysis lasted, however, but a short time; for Tess\u2019s energies returned with the atrophy of his, and she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward. As soon as she could reflect, it appalled her, this change in their relative platforms. He who had wrought her undoing was now on the side of the Spirit, while she remained unregenerate. And, as in the legend, it had resulted that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared upon his altar, whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished. She went on without turning her head. Her back seemed to be endowed with a sensitiveness to ocular beams\u2014even her clothing\u2014so alive was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the outside of that barn.", " \u201cWell, but\u2014surely you care for \u2019n! Do you?\u201d Instead of answering, Tess, with tears in her eyes, impulsively faced in the direction in which she imagined South America to lie, and, putting up her lips, blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind. \u201cWell, well, I know you do. But \u2019pon my body, it is a rum life for a married couple! There\u2014I won\u2019t say another word! Well, as for the weather, it won\u2019t hurt us in the wheat-barn; but reed-drawing is fearful hard work\u2014worse than swede-hacking. I can stand it because I\u2019m stout; but you be slimmer than I. I can\u2019t think why maister should have set \u2019ee at it.\u201d They reached the wheat-barn and entered it. One end of the long structure was full of corn; the middle was where the reed-drawing was carried on, and there had already been placed in the reed-press the evening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for the women to draw from during the day. \u201cWhy, here\u2019s Izz!\u201d said Marian. Izz it was, and she came forward. She had walked all the way from her mother\u2019s home on the previous afternoon, and, not deeming the distance so great, had been belated, arriving, however, just before the snow began, and sleeping at the alehouse. The farmer had agreed with her mother at market to take her on if she came to-day, and she had been afraid to disappoint him by delay. In addition to Tess, Marian, and Izz, there were two women from a neighbouring village; two Amazonian sisters, whom Tess with a start remembered as Dark Car, the Queen of Spades, and her junior, the Queen of Diamonds\u2014those who had tried to fight with her in the midnight quarrel at Trantridge."], "Who offers financial help after Tess\u2019s father dies?": [" Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it; and then her mother broached her scheme. \u201cWe must take the ups wi\u2019 the downs, Tess,\u201d said she; \u201cand never could your high blood have been found out at a more called-for moment. You must try your friends. Do ye know that there is a very rich Mrs d\u2019Urberville living on the outskirts o\u2019 The Chase, who must be our relation? You must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some help in our trouble.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care to do that,\u201d says Tess. \u201cIf there is such a lady, \u2019twould be enough for us if she were friendly\u2014not to expect her to give us help.\u201d \u201cYou could win her round to do anything, my dear. Besides, perhaps there\u2019s more in it than you know of. I\u2019ve heard what I\u2019ve heard, good-now.\u201d The oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish; but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful profit. Her mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered that this Mrs d\u2019Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity. But Tess\u2019s pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her. \u201cI\u2019d rather try to get work,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDurbeyfield, you can settle it,\u201d said his wife, turning to where he sat in the background.", " \u201cAbout the children\u2014your brothers and sisters,\u201d he resumed. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of them.\u201d Tess\u2019s heart quivered\u2014he was touching her in a weak place. He had divined her chief anxiety. Since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate. \u201cIf your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?\u201d \u201cHe can with my assistance. He must!\u201d \u201cAnd with mine.\u201d \u201cNo, sir!\u201d \u201cHow damned foolish this is!\u201d burst out d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhy, he thinks we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!\u201d \u201cHe don\u2019t. I\u2019ve undeceived him.\u201d \u201cThe more fool you!\u201d D\u2019Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away. Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; she wondered if he had gone back to her father\u2019s house; and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards. Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters. \u201cO, Tessy\u2014what do you think! \u2019Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there\u2019s a lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think father is dead!\u201d The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till, beholding the effect produced upon her, she said\u2014 \u201cWhat, Tess, shan\u2019t we talk to father never no more?\u201d \u201cBut father was only a little bit ill!\u201d exclaimed Tess distractedly.", " In Saint Charles\u2019s days we was made Knights o\u2019 the Royal Oak, our real name being d\u2019Urberville!... Don\u2019t that make your bosom plim? \u2019Twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee; not because he\u2019d been drinking, as people supposed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad of that. Will it do us any good, mother?\u201d \u201cO yes! \u2019Tis thoughted that great things may come o\u2019t. No doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as \u2019tis known. Your father learnt it on his way hwome from Shaston, and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter.\u201d \u201cWhere is father now?\u201d asked Tess suddenly. Her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: \u201cHe called to see the doctor to-day in Shaston. It is not consumption at all, it seems. It is fat round his heart, \u2019a says. There, it is like this.\u201d Joan Durbeyfield, as she spoke, curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter C, and used the other forefinger as a pointer. \u201c\u2018At the present moment,\u2019 he says to your father, \u2018your heart is enclosed all round there, and all round there; this space is still open,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018As soon as it do meet, so,\u2019\u201d\u2014Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete\u2014\u201c\u2018off you will go like a shadder, Mr Durbeyfield,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.\u2019\u201d Tess looked alarmed. Her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud so soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!", " It is true that my neighbour Chant\u2019s daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the Communion-table\u2014alter, as I was shocked to hear her call it one day\u2014with flowers and other stuff on festival occasions. But her father, who is quite as opposed to such flummery as I, says that can be cured. It is a mere girlish outbreak which, I am sure, will not be permanent.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; Mercy is good and devout, I know. But, father, don\u2019t you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant, but one who, in place of that lady\u2019s ecclesiastical accomplishments, understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself, would suit me infinitely better?\u201d His father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer\u2019s wife\u2019s duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father\u2019s feelings and to advance the cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious. He said that fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist, and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind. He would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low Church School of his father; but she would probably be open to conviction on that point; she was a regular church-goer of simple faith; honest-hearted, receptive, intelligent, graceful to a degree, chaste as a vestal, and, in personal appearance, exceptionally beautiful."], "When Angel returns, how does Tess ultimately leave Alec?": [" Tess had thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from Angel\u2019s bankers, and, the case being so deplorable, as soon as the sum was received she sent the twenty as requested. Part of the remainder she was obliged to expend in winter clothing, leaving only a nominal sum for the whole inclement season at hand. When the last pound had gone, a remark of Angel\u2019s that whenever she required further resources she was to apply to his father, remained to be considered. But the more Tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she to take it. The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be called, on Clare\u2019s account, which had led her to hide from her own parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her owning to his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her. They probably despised her already; how much more they would despise her in the character of a mendicant! The consequence was that by no effort could the parson\u2019s daughter-in-law bring herself to let him know her state. Her reluctance to communicate with her husband\u2019s parents might, she thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her own the reverse obtained. On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately going to join her husband; and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return in comfort, hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result in a short stay only, after which he would come to fetch her, or that he would write for her to join him; in any case that they would soon present a united front to their families and the world.", " A loud laugh from behind Tess\u2019s back, in the shade of the garden, united with the titter within the room. She looked round, and saw the red coal of a cigar: Alec d\u2019Urberville was standing there alone. He beckoned to her, and she reluctantly retreated towards him. \u201cWell, my Beauty, what are you doing here?\u201d She was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided her trouble to him\u2014that she had been waiting ever since he saw her to have their company home, because the road at night was strange to her. \u201cBut it seems they will never leave off, and I really think I will wait no longer.\u201d \u201cCertainly do not. I have only a saddle-horse here to-day; but come to The Flower-de-Luce, and I\u2019ll hire a trap, and drive you home with me.\u201d Tess, though flattered, had never quite got over her original mistrust of him, and, despite their tardiness, she preferred to walk home with the work-folk. So she answered that she was much obliged to him, but would not trouble him. \u201cI have said that I will wait for \u2019em, and they will expect me to now.\u201d \u201cVery well, Miss Independence. Please yourself... Then I shall not hurry... My good Lord, what a kick-up they are having there!\u201d He had not put himself forward into the light, but some of them had perceived him, and his presence led to a slight pause and a consideration of how the time was flying. As soon as he had re-lit a cigar and walked away the Trantridge people began to collect themselves from amid those who had come in from other farms, and prepared to leave in a body.", " \u201cIt is a long while before he returns past Trantridge Cross. Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?\u201d Tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young man was pressing, and she consented to accompany him. He conducted her about the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence to the fruit-garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked strawberries. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess, \u201cwhen they come.\u201d \u201cThey are already here.\u201d D\u2019Urberville began gathering specimens of the fruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and, presently, selecting a specially fine product of the \u201cBritish Queen\u201d variety, he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth. \u201cNo\u2014no!\u201d she said quickly, putting her fingers between his hand and her lips. \u201cI would rather take it in my own hand.\u201d \u201cNonsense!\u201d he insisted; and in a slight distress she parted her lips and took it in. They had spent some time wandering desultorily thus, Tess eating in a half-pleased, half-reluctant state whatever d\u2019Urberville offered her. When she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled her little basket with them; and then the two passed round to the rose-trees, whence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her bosom. She obeyed like one in a dream, and when she could affix no more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat, and heaped her basket with others in the prodigality of his bounty.", " \u201cO, will you go away\u2014for the sake of me and my husband\u2014go, in the name of your own Christianity!\u201d \u201cYes, yes; I will,\u201d he said abruptly, and thrusting the glove back to her he turned to leave. Facing round, however, he said, \u201cTess, as God is my judge, I meant no humbug in taking your hand!\u201d A pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field, which they had not noticed in their preoccupation, ceased close behind them; and a voice reached her ear: \u201cWhat the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o\u2019 day?\u201d Farmer Groby had espied the two figures from the distance, and had inquisitively ridden across, to learn what was their business in his field. \u201cDon\u2019t speak like that to her!\u201d said d\u2019Urberville, his face blackening with something that was not Christianity. \u201cIndeed, Mister! And what mid Methodist pa\u2019sons have to do with she?\u201d \u201cWho is the fellow?\u201d asked d\u2019Urberville, turning to Tess. She went close up to him. \u201cGo\u2014I do beg you!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat! And leave you to that tyrant? I can see in his face what a churl he is.\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt me. _He\u2019s_ not in love with me. I can leave at Lady-Day.\u201d \u201cWell, I have no right but to obey, I suppose. But\u2014well, goodbye!\u201d Her defender, whom she dreaded more than her assailant, having reluctantly disappeared, the farmer continued his reprimand, which Tess took with the greatest coolness, that sort of attack being independent of sex. To have as a master this man of stone, who would have cuffed her if he had dared, was almost a relief after her former experiences."], "When John Durbeyfield learns that he is descended from a noble line, what is he quick to attempt to do with the information?": [" The fly moved creepingly up a hill, and Clare watched it go with an unpremeditated hope that Tess would look out of the window for one moment. But that she never thought of doing, would not have ventured to do, lying in a half-dead faint inside. Thus he beheld her recede, and in the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet, with peculiar emendations of his own\u2014 God\u2019s _not_ in his heaven: All\u2019s _wrong_ with the world! When Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his own way, and hardly knew that he loved her still. XXXVIII As she drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and the landscape of her youth began to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor. Her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents? She reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the village. It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who had kept it for many years, and to whom she had been known; he had probably left on New Year\u2019s Day, the date when such changes were made. Having received no intelligence lately from her home, she asked the turnpike-keeper for news. \u201cOh\u2014nothing, miss,\u201d he answered. \u201cMarlott is Marlott still. Folks have died and that. John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter married this week to a gentleman-farmer; not from John\u2019s own house, you know; they was married elsewhere; the gentleman being of that high standing that John\u2019s own folk was not considered well-be-doing enough to have any part in it, the bridegroom seeming not to know how\u2019t have been discovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood, with family skillentons in their own vaults to this day, but done out of his property in the time o\u2019 the Romans.", " \u201cOh, \u2019tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield\u2014Lard\u2014how you frightened me!\u2014I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover\u2019ment.\u201d Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of the conclave, and turned to where her husband sat. He was humming absently to himself, in a low tone: \u201cI be as good as some folks here and there! I\u2019ve got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill, and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve something to tell \u2019ee that\u2019s come into my head about that\u2014a grand projick!\u201d whispered his cheerful wife. \u201cHere, John, don\u2019t \u2019ee see me?\u201d She nudged him, while he, looking through her as through a window-pane, went on with his recitative. \u201cHush! Don\u2019t \u2019ee sing so loud, my good man,\u201d said the landlady; \u201cin case any member of the Gover\u2019ment should be passing, and take away my licends.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s told \u2019ee what\u2019s happened to us, I suppose?\u201d asked Mrs Durbeyfield. \u201cYes\u2014in a way. D\u2019ye think there\u2019s any money hanging by it?\u201d \u201cAh, that\u2019s the secret,\u201d said Joan Durbeyfield sagely. \u201cHowever, \u2019tis well to be kin to a coach, even if you don\u2019t ride in \u2019en.\u201d She dropped her public voice, and continued in a low tone to her husband: \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking since you brought the news that there\u2019s a great rich lady out by Trantridge, on the edge o\u2019 The Chase, of the name of d\u2019Urberville.\u201d \u201cHey\u2014what\u2019s that?\u201d said Sir John. She repeated the information. \u201cThat lady must be our relation,\u201d she said.", " And in the bottom o\u2019 the carriage they be to put a noggin o\u2019 rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up to my account. And when you\u2019ve done that goo on to my house with the basket, and tell my wife to put away that washing, because she needn\u2019t finish it, and wait till I come hwome, as I\u2019ve news to tell her.\u201d As the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his hand in his pocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that he possessed. \u201cHere\u2019s for your labour, lad.\u201d This made a difference in the young man\u2019s estimate of the position. \u201cYes, Sir John. Thank \u2019ee. Anything else I can do for \u2019ee, Sir John?\u201d \u201cTell \u2019em at hwome that I should like for supper,\u2014well, lamb\u2019s fry if they can get it; and if they can\u2019t, black-pot; and if they can\u2019t get that, well chitterlings will do.\u201d \u201cYes, Sir John.\u201d The boy took up the basket, and as he set out the notes of a brass band were heard from the direction of the village. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Durbeyfield. \u201cNot on account o\u2019 I?\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis the women\u2019s club-walking, Sir John. Why, your da\u2019ter is one o\u2019 the members.\u201d \u201cTo be sure\u2014I\u2019d quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things! Well, vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and maybe I\u2019ll drive round and inspect the club.\u201d The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies in the evening sun. Not a soul passed that way for a long while, and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within the rim of blue hills.", " \u201cBoy, take up that basket! I want \u2019ee to go on an errand for me.\u201d The lath-like stripling frowned. \u201cWho be you, then, John Durbeyfield, to order me about and call me \u2018boy\u2019? You know my name as well as I know yours!\u201d \u201cDo you, do you? That\u2019s the secret\u2014that\u2019s the secret! Now obey my orders, and take the message I\u2019m going to charge \u2019ee wi\u2019... Well, Fred, I don\u2019t mind telling you that the secret is that I\u2019m one of a noble race\u2014it has been just found out by me this present afternoon, p.m.\u201d And as he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from his sitting position, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies. The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from crown to toe. \u201cSir John d\u2019Urberville\u2014that\u2019s who I am,\u201d continued the prostrate man. \u201cThat is if knights were baronets\u2014which they be. \u2019Tis recorded in history all about me. Dost know of such a place, lad, as Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill?\u201d \u201cEes. I\u2019ve been there to Greenhill Fair.\u201d \u201cWell, under the church of that city there lie\u2014\u201d \u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t a city, the place I mean; leastwise \u2019twaddn\u2019 when I was there\u2014\u2019twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o\u2019 place.\u201d \u201cNever you mind the place, boy, that\u2019s not the question before us. Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors\u2014hundreds of \u2019em\u2014in coats of mail and jewels, in gr\u2019t lead coffins weighing tons and tons. There\u2019s not a man in the county o\u2019 South-Wessex that\u2019s got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I.\u201d \u201cOh?\u201d \u201cNow take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you\u2019ve come to The Pure Drop Inn, tell \u2019em to send a horse and carriage to me immed\u2019ately, to carry me hwome."], "Mrs. d\u2019Urberville is ___ and frequently ill.": [" By this means they had found that she was living here again; her mother was scolded for \u201charbouring\u201d her; sharp retorts had ensued from Joan, who had independently offered to leave at once; she had been taken at her word; and here was the result. \u201cI ought never to have come home,\u201d said Tess to herself, bitterly. She was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the street. Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that he saw her so quickly, and directed his horse so close to the cottage-front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for plants growing under the wall. It was not till he touched the window with his riding-crop that she observed him. The rain had nearly ceased, and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me?\u201d asked d\u2019Urberville. \u201cI was not attending,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard you, I believe, though I fancied it was a carriage and horses. I was in a sort of dream.\u201d \u201cAh! you heard the d\u2019Urberville Coach, perhaps. You know the legend, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNo. My\u2014somebody was going to tell it me once, but didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIf you are a genuine d\u2019Urberville I ought not to tell you either, I suppose. As for me, I\u2019m a sham one, so it doesn\u2019t matter. It is rather dismal. It is that this sound of a non-existent coach can only be heard by one of d\u2019Urberville blood, and it is held to be of ill-omen to the one who hears it.", " \u201cWhat is the legend\u2014may I know it?\u201d \u201cWell\u2014I would rather not tell it in detail just now. A certain d\u2019Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a dreadful crime in his family coach; and since that time members of the family see or hear the old coach whenever\u2014\u2014 But I\u2019ll tell you another day\u2014it is rather gloomy. Evidently some dim knowledge of it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable caravan.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember hearing it before,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIs it when we are going to die, Angel, that members of my family see it, or is it when we have committed a crime?\u201d \u201cNow, Tess!\u201d He silenced her by a kiss. By the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless. She was Mrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name? Was she not more truly Mrs Alexander d\u2019Urberville? Could intensity of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable reticence? She knew not what was expected of women in such cases; and she had no counsellor. However, when she found herself alone in her room for a few minutes\u2014the last day this on which she was ever to enter it\u2014she knelt down and prayed. She tried to pray to God, but it was her husband who really had her supplication. Her idolatry of this man was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill-omened. She was conscious of the notion expressed by Friar Laurence: \u201cThese violent delights have violent ends.\u201d It might be too desperate for human conditions\u2014too rank, to wild, too deadly.", " \u201cI hope it is a chance for earning money. It is no other kind of chance. You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish.\u201d Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise. She was not quite sure that she did not feel proud enough, after the visitor\u2019s remarks, to say a good deal. Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required. She was duly informed that Mrs d\u2019Urberville was glad of her decision, and that a spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of the Vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself prepared to start. Mrs d\u2019Urberville\u2019s handwriting seemed rather masculine. \u201cA cart?\u201d murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. \u201cIt might have been a carriage for her own kin!\u201d Having at last taken her course Tess was less restless and abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous. She had hoped to be a teacher at the school, but the fates seemed to decide otherwise. Being mentally older than her mother she did not regard Mrs Durbeyfield\u2019s matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment. The light-minded woman had been discovering good matches for her daughter almost from the year of her birth. VII On the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before dawn\u2014at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute, save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear-voiced conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken.", " I have thought what joy it will be to do it, what an unworthy wife I shall be if I do not! That\u2019s what I have felt, Angel!\u201d \u201cI know that.\u201d \u201cI thought, Angel, that you loved me\u2014me, my very self! If it is I you do love, O how can it be that you look and speak so? It frightens me! Having begun to love you, I love you for ever\u2014in all changes, in all disgraces, because you are yourself. I ask no more. Then how can you, O my own husband, stop loving me?\u201d \u201cI repeat, the woman I have been loving is not you.\u201d \u201cBut who?\u201d \u201cAnother woman in your shape.\u201d She perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive foreboding in former times. He looked upon her as a species of imposter; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one. Terror was upon her white face as she saw it; her cheek was flaccid, and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole. The horrible sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered, and he stepped forward, thinking she was going to fall. \u201cSit down, sit down,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou are ill; and it is natural that you should be.\u201d She did sit down, without knowing where she was, that strained look still upon her face, and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep. \u201cI don\u2019t belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?\u201d she asked helplessly. \u201cIt is not me, but another woman like me that he loved, he says.\u201d The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was ill-used."], "What does Retty Priddle do when Angel Clare chooses to marry Tess?": [" \u201cThere he is again!\u201d They all three blew him a silent kiss. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Retty quickly. \u201cBecause he likes Tess Durbeyfield best,\u201d said Marian, lowering her voice. \u201cI have watched him every day, and have found it out.\u201d There was a reflective silence. \u201cBut she don\u2019t care anything for \u2019n?\u201d at length breathed Retty. \u201cWell\u2014I sometimes think that too.\u201d \u201cBut how silly all this is!\u201d said Izz Huett impatiently. \u201cOf course he won\u2019t marry any one of us, or Tess either\u2014a gentleman\u2019s son, who\u2019s going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! More likely to ask us to come wi\u2019en as farm-hands at so much a year!\u201d One sighed, and another sighed, and Marian\u2019s plump figure sighed biggest of all. Somebody in bed hard by sighed too. Tears came into the eyes of Retty Priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest\u2014the last bud of the Paridelles, so important in the county annals. They watched silently a little longer, their three faces still close together as before, and the triple hues of their hair mingling. But the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and they saw him no more; and, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds. In a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room. Marian was soon snoring, but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time. Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep. The deeper-passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then. This conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to swallow that day.", " \u201cHis thoughts be of other cheeks than thine!\u201d Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again. \u201cThere he is again!\u201d cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp hair and keenly cut lips. \u201cYou needn\u2019t say anything, Izz,\u201d answered Retty. \u201cFor I zid you kissing his shade.\u201d _\u201dWhat_ did you see her doing?\u201d asked Marian. \u201cWhy\u2014he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was standing there filling a vat. She put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cO Izz Huett!\u201d said Marian. A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett\u2019s cheek. \u201cWell, there was no harm in it,\u201d she declared, with attempted coolness. \u201cAnd if I be in love wi\u2019en, so is Retty, too; and so be you, Marian, come to that.\u201d Marian\u2019s full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness. \u201cI!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a tale! Ah, there he is again! Dear eyes\u2014dear face\u2014dear Mr Clare!\u201d \u201cThere\u2014you\u2019ve owned it!\u201d \u201cSo have you\u2014so have we all,\u201d said Marian, with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion. \u201cIt is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would just marry \u2019n to-morrow!\u201d \u201cSo would I\u2014and more,\u201d murmured Izz Huett. \u201cAnd I too,\u201d whispered the more timid Retty. The listener grew warm. \u201cWe can\u2019t all marry him,\u201d said Izz. \u201cWe shan\u2019t, either of us; which is worse still,\u201d said the eldest.", " Will you be that woman, Tessy?\u201d He put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove. She turned quite careworn. She had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon. With pain that was like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman. \u201cO Mr Clare\u2014I cannot be your wife\u2014I cannot be!\u201d The sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess\u2019s very heart, and she bowed her face in her grief. \u201cBut, Tess!\u201d he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more greedily close. \u201cDo you say no? Surely you love me?\u201d \u201cO yes, yes! And I would rather be yours than anybody\u2019s in the world,\u201d returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl. \u201cBut I _cannot_ marry you!\u201d \u201cTess,\u201d he said, holding her at arm\u2019s length, \u201cyou are engaged to marry some one else!\u201d \u201cNo, no!\u201d \u201cThen why do you refuse me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry! I have not thought of doing it. I cannot! I only want to love you.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d Driven to subterfuge, she stammered\u2014 \u201cYour father is a parson, and your mother wouldn\u2019 like you to marry such as me. She will want you to marry a lady.\u201d \u201cNonsense\u2014I have spoken to them both. That was partly why I went home.\u201d \u201cI feel I cannot\u2014never, never!\u201d she echoed.", " A light was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed, awaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts. But she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood. They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to have. Their condition was objective, contemplative. \u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her!\u201d murmured Retty, never taking eyes off Tess. \u201cHow her face do show it!\u201d \u201cYou _be_ going to marry him?\u201d asked Marian. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess. \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cSome day.\u201d They thought that this was evasiveness only. \u201c_Yes_\u2014going to _marry_ him\u2014a gentleman!\u201d repeated Izz Huett. And by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another, crept out of their beds, and came and stood barefooted round Tess. Retty put her hands upon Tess\u2019s shoulders, as if to realize her friend\u2019s corporeality after such a miracle, and the other two laid their arms round her waist, all looking into her face. \u201cHow it do seem! Almost more than I can think of!\u201d said Izz Huett. Marian kissed Tess. \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured as she withdrew her lips. \u201cWas that because of love for her, or because other lips have touched there by now?\u201d continued Izz drily to Marian. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking o\u2019 that,\u201d said Marian simply. \u201cI was on\u2019y feeling all the strangeness o\u2019t\u2014that she is to be his wife, and nobody else. I don\u2019t say nay to it, nor either of us, because we did not think of it\u2014only loved him. Still, nobody else is to marry\u2019n in the world\u2014no fine lady, nobody in silks and satins; but she who do live like we.\u201d \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t dislike me for it?\u201d said Tess in a low voice."], "How does Mrs. Clare feel about social class?": [" He held that education had as yet but little affected the beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends. It was probable that, in the lapse of ages, improved systems of moral and intellectual training would appreciably, perhaps considerably, elevate the involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human nature; but up to the present day, culture, as far as he could see, might be said to have affected only the mental epiderm of those lives which had been brought under its influence. This belief was confirmed by his experience of women, which, having latterly been extended from the cultivated middle-class into the rural community, had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference between the good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and wise woman of another social stratum, than between the good and bad, the wise and the foolish, of the same stratum or class. It was the morning of his departure. His brothers had already left the Vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one was to return to his college, and the other to his curacy. Angel might have accompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays. He would have been an awkward member of the party; for, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal religionist, even the best-versed Christologist of the three, there was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him.", " In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice. They said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would not object to see her. Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now. He felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents were, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as middle-class people, which it would require some tact to overcome. For though legally at liberty to do as he chose, and though their daughter-in-law\u2019s qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives, in the probability of her living far away from them, he wished for affection\u2019s sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important decision of his life. He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in Tess\u2019s life as if they were vital features. It was for herself that he loved Tess; her soul, her heart, her substance\u2014not for her skill in the dairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for her simple formal faith-professions. Her unsophisticated open-air existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable to him.", " The labourers\u2014or \u201cwork-folk\u201d, as they used to call themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from without\u2014who wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to the new farms. These annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here. When Tess\u2019s mother was a child the majority of the field-folk about Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latterly the desire for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch. With the younger families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage. The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it from a distance, till by residence there it became in turn their Egypt also; and so they changed and changed. However, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. A depopulation was also going on. The village had formerly contained, side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and better-informed class, ranking distinctly above the former\u2014the class to which Tess\u2019s father and mother had belonged\u2014and including the carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with nondescript workers other than farm-labourers; a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess\u2019s father, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders.", " \u201cI hope it is a chance for earning money. It is no other kind of chance. You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish.\u201d Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise. She was not quite sure that she did not feel proud enough, after the visitor\u2019s remarks, to say a good deal. Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required. She was duly informed that Mrs d\u2019Urberville was glad of her decision, and that a spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of the Vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself prepared to start. Mrs d\u2019Urberville\u2019s handwriting seemed rather masculine. \u201cA cart?\u201d murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. \u201cIt might have been a carriage for her own kin!\u201d Having at last taken her course Tess was less restless and abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous. She had hoped to be a teacher at the school, but the fates seemed to decide otherwise. Being mentally older than her mother she did not regard Mrs Durbeyfield\u2019s matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment. The light-minded woman had been discovering good matches for her daughter almost from the year of her birth. VII On the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before dawn\u2014at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute, save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear-voiced conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken."], "What job do Angel\u2019s father and two brothers hold?": [" \u201cBut what shall I tell the dairyman\u2019s wife?\u201d said Angel. \u201cThe truth, of course,\u201d said his father. \u201cI rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black-puddings very much. She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me directly I return.\u201d \u201cYou cannot, if we did not,\u201d Mr Clare answered lucidly. \u201cAh\u2014no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple.\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d said Cuthbert and Felix both. \u201cOh\u2014\u2019tis an expression they use down at Talbothays,\u201d replied Angel, blushing. He felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more. XXVI It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his heart. He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of their walking boots. When the service was over they went out of the room with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone. The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale\u2014either in England or in the Colonies. His father then told him that, as he had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel himself unduly slighted.", " Down, down, they sped, the wheels humming like a top, the dog-cart rocking right and left, its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set in relation to the line of progress; the figure of the horse rising and falling in undulations before them. Sometimes a wheel was off the ground, it seemed, for many yards; sometimes a stone was sent spinning over the hedge, and flinty sparks from the horse\u2019s hoofs outshone the daylight. The aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance, the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one rushing past at each shoulder. The wind blew through Tess\u2019s white muslin to her very skin, and her washed hair flew out behind. She was determined to show no open fear, but she clutched d\u2019Urberville\u2019s rein-arm. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my arm! We shall be thrown out if you do! Hold on round my waist!\u201d She grasped his waist, and so they reached the bottom. \u201cSafe, thank God, in spite of your fooling!\u201d said she, her face on fire. \u201cTess\u2014fie! that\u2019s temper!\u201d said d\u2019Urberville. \u201c\u2019Tis truth.\u201d \u201cWell, you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment you feel yourself out of danger.\u201d She had not considered what she had been doing; whether he were man or woman, stick or stone, in her involuntary hold on him. Recovering her reserve, she sat without replying, and thus they reached the summit of another declivity. \u201cNow then, again!\u201d said d\u2019Urberville. \u201cNo, no!\u201d said Tess.", " \u201cAbout the children\u2014your brothers and sisters,\u201d he resumed. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of them.\u201d Tess\u2019s heart quivered\u2014he was touching her in a weak place. He had divined her chief anxiety. Since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate. \u201cIf your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?\u201d \u201cHe can with my assistance. He must!\u201d \u201cAnd with mine.\u201d \u201cNo, sir!\u201d \u201cHow damned foolish this is!\u201d burst out d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhy, he thinks we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!\u201d \u201cHe don\u2019t. I\u2019ve undeceived him.\u201d \u201cThe more fool you!\u201d D\u2019Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away. Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; she wondered if he had gone back to her father\u2019s house; and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards. Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters. \u201cO, Tessy\u2014what do you think! \u2019Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there\u2019s a lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think father is dead!\u201d The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till, beholding the effect produced upon her, she said\u2014 \u201cWhat, Tess, shan\u2019t we talk to father never no more?\u201d \u201cBut father was only a little bit ill!\u201d exclaimed Tess distractedly.", " Tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her brothers-in-law brought them so nearly behind her back that she could hear every word of their conversation. They said nothing, however, which particularly interested her till, observing the young lady still further in front, one of them remarked, \u201cThere is Mercy Chant. Let us overtake her.\u201d Tess knew the name. It was the woman who had been destined for Angel\u2019s life-companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably would have married but for her intrusive self. She would have known as much without previous information if she had waited a moment, for one of the brothers proceeded to say: \u201cAh! poor Angel, poor Angel! I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever she may be. It is a queer business, apparently. Whether she has joined him yet or not I don\u2019t know; but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from him.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say. He never tells me anything nowadays. His ill-considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions.\u201d Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but she could not outwalk them without exciting notice. At last they outsped her altogether, and passed her by. The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned. Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands, and the three went on together."], "Who calls Tess Artemis, Demeter, and Daughter of Nature?": [" He called her Artemis, Demeter, and other fanciful names half teasingly, which she did not like because she did not understand them. \u201cCall me Tess,\u201d she would say askance; and he did. Then it would grow lighter, and her features would become simply feminine; they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer bliss to those of a being who craved it. At these non-human hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl. Herons came, with a great bold noise as of opening doors and shutters, out of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at the side of the mead; or, if already on the spot, hardily maintained their standing in the water as the pair walked by, watching them by moving their heads round in a slow, horizontal, passionless wheel, like the turn of puppets by clockwork. They could then see the faint summer fogs in layers, woolly, level, and apparently no thicker than counterpanes, spread about the meadows in detached remnants of small extent. On the gray moisture of the grass were marks where the cows had lain through the night\u2014dark-green islands of dry herbage the size of their carcasses, in the general sea of dew. From each island proceeded a serpentine trail, by which the cow had rambled away to feed after getting up, at the end of which trail they found her; the snoring puff from her nostrils, when she recognized them, making an intenser little fog of her own amid the prevailing one.", " The afternoon advanced, and still she remained among the willows. She heard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands; the \u201cwaow-waow!\u201d which accompanied the getting together of the cows. But she did not go to the milking. They would see her agitation; and the dairyman, thinking the cause to be love alone, would good-naturedly tease her; and that harassment could not be borne. Her lover must have guessed her overwrought state, and invented some excuse for her non-appearance, for no inquiries were made or calls given. At half-past six the sun settled down upon the levels with the aspect of a great forge in the heavens; and presently a monstrous pumpkin-like moon arose on the other hand. The pollard willows, tortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings, became spiny-haired monsters as they stood up against it. She went in and upstairs without a light. It was now Wednesday. Thursday came, and Angel looked thoughtfully at her from a distance, but intruded in no way upon her. The indoor milkmaids, Marian and the rest, seemed to guess that something definite was afoot, for they did not force any remarks upon her in the bedchamber. Friday passed; Saturday. To-morrow was the day. \u201cI shall give way\u2014I shall say yes\u2014I shall let myself marry him\u2014I cannot help it!\u201d she jealously panted, with her hot face to the pillow that night, on hearing one of the other girls sigh his name in her sleep.", " \u201cI\u2019ll rock the cradle for \u2019ee, mother,\u201d said the daughter gently. \u201cOr I\u2019ll take off my best frock and help you wring up? I thought you had finished long ago.\u201d Her mother bore Tess no ill-will for leaving the housework to her single-handed efforts for so long; indeed, Joan seldom upbraided her thereon at any time, feeling but slightly the lack of Tess\u2019s assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in postponing them. To-night, however, she was even in a blither mood than usual. There was a dreaminess, a pre-occupation, an exaltation, in the maternal look which the girl could not understand. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come,\u201d her mother said, as soon as the last note had passed out of her. \u201cI want to go and fetch your father; but what\u2019s more\u2019n that, I want to tell \u2019ee what have happened. Y\u2019ll be fess enough, my poppet, when th\u2019st know!\u201d (Mrs Durbeyfield habitually spoke the dialect; her daughter, who had passed the Sixth Standard in the National School under a London-trained mistress, spoke two languages: the dialect at home, more or less; ordinary English abroad and to persons of quality.) \u201cSince I\u2019ve been away?\u201d Tess asked. \u201cAy!\u201d \u201cHad it anything to do with father\u2019s making such a mommet of himself in thik carriage this afternoon? Why did \u2019er? I felt inclined to sink into the ground with shame!\u201d \u201cThat wer all a part of the larry! We\u2019ve been found to be the greatest gentlefolk in the whole county\u2014reaching all back long before Oliver Grumble\u2019s time\u2014to the days of the Pagan Turks\u2014with monuments, and vaults, and crests, and \u2019scutcheons, and the Lord knows what all.", " \u201cWhat\u2014really now? And is it so, maidy?\u201d he said. \u201cA very easy way to feel \u2019em go,\u201d continued Tess, \u201cis to lie on the grass at night and look straight up at some big bright star; and, by fixing your mind upon it, you will soon find that you are hundreds and hundreds o\u2019 miles away from your body, which you don\u2019t seem to want at all.\u201d The dairyman removed his hard gaze from Tess, and fixed it on his wife. \u201cNow that\u2019s a rum thing, Christianer\u2014hey? To think o\u2019 the miles I\u2019ve vamped o\u2019 starlight nights these last thirty year, courting, or trading, or for doctor, or for nurse, and yet never had the least notion o\u2019 that till now, or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch above my shirt-collar.\u201d The general attention being drawn to her, including that of the dairyman\u2019s pupil, Tess flushed, and remarking evasively that it was only a fancy, resumed her breakfast. Clare continued to observe her. She soon finished her eating, and having a consciousness that Clare was regarding her, began to trace imaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the constraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched. \u201cWhat a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is!\u201d he said to himself. And then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar, something which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past, before the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray."], "In a religious sense, what does Tess represent?": [" Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of his old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree, though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an academical training. Some two or three years before Angel\u2019s appearance at the Marlott dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller\u2019s, directed to the Reverend James Clare. The Vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm. \u201cWhy has this been sent to my house?\u201d he asked peremptorily, holding up the volume. \u201cIt was ordered, sir.\u201d \u201cNot by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.\u201d The shopkeeper looked into his order-book. \u201cOh, it has been misdirected, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was ordered by Mr Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.\u201d Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck. He went home pale and dejected, and called Angel into his study. \u201cLook into this book, my boy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d \u201cI ordered it,\u201d said Angel simply. \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cTo read.\u201d \u201cHow can you think of reading it?\u201d \u201cHow can I? Why\u2014it is a system of philosophy. There is no more moral, or even religious, work published.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014moral enough; I don\u2019t deny that. But religious!\u2014and for _you_, who intend to be a minister of the Gospel!\u201d \u201cSince you have alluded to the matter, father,\u201d said the son, with anxious thought upon his face, \u201cI should like to say, once for all, that I should prefer not to take Orders.", " I will walk with you as far as your home.\u201d \u201cO yes,\u201d she answered with a jaded gait. \u201cWalk wi\u2019 me if you will! I do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o\u2019 my state. Perhaps\u2014perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I have been thinking you were. Whatever is meant as kindness I am grateful for; whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at. I cannot sense your meaning sometimes.\u201d \u201cIf I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist you. And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than I formerly showed. My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over. But I retain a little good nature; I hope I do. Now, Tess, by all that\u2019s tender and strong between man and woman, trust me! I have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety, both for yourself and your parents and sisters. I can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me.\u201d \u201cHave you seen \u2019em lately?\u201d she quickly inquired. \u201cYes. They didn\u2019t know where you were. It was only by chance that I found you here.\u201d The cold moon looked aslant upon Tess\u2019s fagged face between the twigs of the garden-hedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her temporary home, d\u2019Urberville pausing beside her. \u201cDon\u2019t mention my little brothers and sisters\u2014don\u2019t make me break down quite!\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to help them\u2014God knows they need it\u2014do it without telling me.", " Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had engaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to all travellers through the Froom Valley; once portion of a fine manorial residence, and the property and seat of a d\u2019Urberville, but since its partial demolition a farmhouse. \u201cWelcome to one of your ancestral mansions!\u201d said Clare as he handed her down. But he regretted the pleasantry; it was too near a satire. On entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple of rooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence during the coming days to pay a New Year\u2019s visit to some friends, leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their few wants. The absoluteness of possession pleased them, and they realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own exclusive roof-tree. But he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his bride. When the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash their hands, the charwoman showing the way. On the landing Tess stopped and started. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said he. \u201cThose horrid women!\u201d she answered with a smile. \u201cHow they frightened me.\u201d He looked up, and perceived two life-size portraits on panels built into the masonry. As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten.", " Tess knew that she must break down. Neither a religious sense of a certain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish for candour could hold out against it much longer. She loved him so passionately, and he was so godlike in her eyes; and being, though untrained, instinctively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary guidance. And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, \u201cI can never be his wife,\u201d the words were vain. A proof of her weakness lay in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the trouble to formulate. Every sound of his voice beginning on the old subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and she coveted the recantation she feared. His manner was\u2014what man\u2019s is not?\u2014so much that of one who would love and cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes, charges, or revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it. The season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox, and though it was still fine, the days were much shorter. The dairy had again worked by morning candlelight for a long time; and a fresh renewal of Clare\u2019s pleading occurred one morning between three and four. She had run up in her bedgown to his door to call him as usual; then had gone back to dress and call the others; and in ten minutes was walking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her hand. At the same moment he came down his steps from above in his shirt-sleeves and put his arm across the stairway."], "How does Alec come to be part of the d\u2019Urberville lineage?": [" This renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment. \u201cI was determined to do summat in honour o\u2019t\u201d, said the dairyman. \u201cAnd as you wouldn\u2019t hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi\u2019 fiddles and bass-viols complete, as we should ha\u2019 done in old times, this was all I could think o\u2019 as a noiseless thing.\u201d Tess\u2019s friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been present at the ceremony, even had any been asked; but as a fact nobody was invited from Marlott. As for Angel\u2019s family, he had written and duly informed them of the time, and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come. His brothers had not replied at all, seeming to be indignant with him; while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter, deploring his precipitancy in rushing into marriage, but making the best of the matter by saying that, though a dairywoman was the last daughter-in-law they could have expected, their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the best judge. This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long. To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as a d\u2019Urberville and a lady, he had felt to be temerarious and risky; hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized with worldly ways by a few months\u2019 travel and reading with him, he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line.", " \u201cBut let us try further on, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess, what\u2019s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!\u201d Accompanied by \u2019Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. \u201cAh\u2014I\u2019m looking for you!\u201d he said, riding up to them. \u201cThis is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!\u201d It was Alec d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhere is Tess?\u201d he asked. Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the direction of the church, and went on, d\u2019Urberville saying that he would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone, d\u2019Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot. In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead, remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall. The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first time in her life. Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff.", " Round about were deparked hills and slopes\u2014now cut up into little paddocks\u2014and the green foundations that showed where the d\u2019Urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate. Hard by, the aisle of the church called the d\u2019Urberville Aisle looked on imperturbably. \u201cIsn\u2019t your family vault your own freehold?\u201d said Tess\u2019s mother, as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. \u201cWhy, of course \u2019tis, and that\u2019s where we will camp, girls, till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof! Now, Tess and \u2019Liza and Abraham, you help me. We\u2019ll make a nest for these children, and then we\u2019ll have another look round.\u201d Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building known as the d\u2019Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay. Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of many lights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called the d\u2019Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield\u2019s old seal and spoon. Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it, and put the smaller children inside. \u201cIf it comes to the worst we can sleep there too, for one night,\u201d she said.", " You are not so fickle\u2014I am come on purpose for you\u2014my mother and father will welcome you now!\u201d \u201cYes\u2014O, yes, yes! But I say, I say it is too late.\u201d She seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream, who tries to move away, but cannot. \u201cDon\u2019t you know all\u2014don\u2019t you know it? Yet how do you come here if you do not know?\u201d \u201cI inquired here and there, and I found the way.\u201d \u201cI waited and waited for you,\u201d she went on, her tones suddenly resuming their old fluty pathos. \u201cBut you did not come! And I wrote to you, and you did not come! He kept on saying you would never come any more, and that I was a foolish woman. He was very kind to me, and to mother, and to all of us after father\u2019s death. He\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cHe has won me back to him.\u201d Clare looked at her keenly, then, gathering her meaning, flagged like one plague-stricken, and his glance sank; it fell on her hands, which, once rosy, were now white and more delicate. She continued\u2014 \u201cHe is upstairs. I hate him now, because he told me a lie\u2014that you would not come again; and you _have_ come! These clothes are what he\u2019s put upon me: I didn\u2019t care what he did wi\u2019 me! But\u2014will you go away, Angel, please, and never come any more?\u201d They stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with a joylessness pitiful to see. Both seemed to implore something to shelter them from reality. \u201cAh\u2014it is my fault!\u201d said Clare. But he could not get on."], "In a religious sense, who does Alec represent?": [" Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of his old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree, though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an academical training. Some two or three years before Angel\u2019s appearance at the Marlott dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller\u2019s, directed to the Reverend James Clare. The Vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm. \u201cWhy has this been sent to my house?\u201d he asked peremptorily, holding up the volume. \u201cIt was ordered, sir.\u201d \u201cNot by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.\u201d The shopkeeper looked into his order-book. \u201cOh, it has been misdirected, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was ordered by Mr Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.\u201d Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck. He went home pale and dejected, and called Angel into his study. \u201cLook into this book, my boy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d \u201cI ordered it,\u201d said Angel simply. \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cTo read.\u201d \u201cHow can you think of reading it?\u201d \u201cHow can I? Why\u2014it is a system of philosophy. There is no more moral, or even religious, work published.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014moral enough; I don\u2019t deny that. But religious!\u2014and for _you_, who intend to be a minister of the Gospel!\u201d \u201cSince you have alluded to the matter, father,\u201d said the son, with anxious thought upon his face, \u201cI should like to say, once for all, that I should prefer not to take Orders.", " Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had engaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to all travellers through the Froom Valley; once portion of a fine manorial residence, and the property and seat of a d\u2019Urberville, but since its partial demolition a farmhouse. \u201cWelcome to one of your ancestral mansions!\u201d said Clare as he handed her down. But he regretted the pleasantry; it was too near a satire. On entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple of rooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence during the coming days to pay a New Year\u2019s visit to some friends, leaving a woman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their few wants. The absoluteness of possession pleased them, and they realized it as the first moment of their experience under their own exclusive roof-tree. But he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his bride. When the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash their hands, the charwoman showing the way. On the landing Tess stopped and started. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said he. \u201cThose horrid women!\u201d she answered with a smile. \u201cHow they frightened me.\u201d He looked up, and perceived two life-size portraits on panels built into the masonry. As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these paintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred years ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten.", " Having decided to remain where she was, Tess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began her meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and immediately after Alec appeared upon the stack\u2014now an oblong and level platform of sheaves. He strode across them, and sat down opposite of her without a word. Tess continued to eat her modest dinner, a slice of thick pancake which she had brought with her. The other workfolk were by this time all gathered under the rick, where the loose straw formed a comfortable retreat. \u201cI am here again, as you see,\u201d said d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhy do you trouble me so!\u201d she cried, reproach flashing from her very finger-ends. \u201c_I_ trouble _you_? I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?\u201d \u201cSure, I don\u2019t trouble you any-when!\u201d \u201cYou say you don\u2019t? But you do! You haunt me. Those very eyes that you turned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago, they come to me just as you showed them then, in the night and in the day! Tess, ever since you told me of that child of ours, it is just as if my feelings, which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream, had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you, and had all at once gushed through. The religious channel is left dry forthwith; and it is you who have done it!\u201d She gazed in silence. \u201cWhat\u2014you have given up your preaching entirely?\u201d she asked. She had gathered from Angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern thought to despise flash enthusiasm; but, as a woman, she was somewhat appalled.", " I will walk with you as far as your home.\u201d \u201cO yes,\u201d she answered with a jaded gait. \u201cWalk wi\u2019 me if you will! I do bear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o\u2019 my state. Perhaps\u2014perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I have been thinking you were. Whatever is meant as kindness I am grateful for; whatever is meant in any other way I am angered at. I cannot sense your meaning sometimes.\u201d \u201cIf I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist you. And I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than I formerly showed. My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over. But I retain a little good nature; I hope I do. Now, Tess, by all that\u2019s tender and strong between man and woman, trust me! I have enough and more than enough to put you out of anxiety, both for yourself and your parents and sisters. I can make them all comfortable if you will only show confidence in me.\u201d \u201cHave you seen \u2019em lately?\u201d she quickly inquired. \u201cYes. They didn\u2019t know where you were. It was only by chance that I found you here.\u201d The cold moon looked aslant upon Tess\u2019s fagged face between the twigs of the garden-hedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her temporary home, d\u2019Urberville pausing beside her. \u201cDon\u2019t mention my little brothers and sisters\u2014don\u2019t make me break down quite!\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to help them\u2014God knows they need it\u2014do it without telling me."], "Angel yearns to dedicate his life to the honor and glory of ___.": [" \u201cWhat is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting ourselves to give you a University education, if it is not to be used for the honour and glory of God?\u201d his father repeated. \u201cWhy, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father.\u201d Perhaps if Angel had persevered he might have gone to Cambridge like his brothers. But the Vicar\u2019s view of that seat of learning as a stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men. \u201cI will do without Cambridge,\u201d said Angel at last. \u201cI feel that I have no right to go there in the circumstances.\u201d The effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing themselves. He spent years and years in desultory studies, undertakings, and meditations; he began to evince considerable indifference to social forms and observances. The material distinctions of rank and wealth he increasingly despised. Even the \u201cgood old family\u201d (to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy) had no aroma for him unless there were good new resolutions in its representatives. As a balance to these austerities, when he went to live in London to see what the world was like, and with a view to practising a profession or business there, he was carried off his head, and nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself, though luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience.", " There was not a human soul near. Sad October and her sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that lane. As she walked, however, some footsteps approached behind her, the footsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his advance he was close at her heels and had said \u201cGood morning\u201d before she had been long aware of his propinquity. He appeared to be an artisan of some sort, and carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand. He asked in a business-like manner if he should take her basket, which she permitted him to do, walking beside him. \u201cIt is early to be astir this Sabbath morn!\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess. \u201cWhen most people are at rest from their week\u2019s work.\u201d She also assented to this. \u201cThough I do more real work to-day than all the week besides.\u201d \u201cDo you?\u201d \u201cAll the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the glory of God. That\u2019s more real than the other\u2014hey? I have a little to do here at this stile.\u201d The man turned, as he spoke, to an opening at the roadside leading into a pasture. \u201cIf you\u2019ll wait a moment,\u201d he added, \u201cI shall not be long.\u201d As he had her basket she could not well do otherwise; and she waited, observing him. He set down her basket and the tin pot, and stirring the paint with the brush that was in it began painting large square letters on the middle board of the three composing the stile, placing a comma after each word, as if to give pause while that word was driven well home to the reader\u2019s heart\u2014 THY, DAMNATION, SLUMBERETH, NOT.", " Thou art in a parlous state, Angel Clare.\u201d \u201c_I_ glory in my Protestantism!\u201d she said severely. Then Clare, thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods in which a man does despite to his true principles, called her close to him, and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas he could think of. His momentary laughter at the horror which appeared on her fair face ceased when it merged in pain and anxiety for his welfare. \u201cDear Mercy,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must forgive me. I think I am going crazy!\u201d She thought that he was; and thus the interview ended, and Clare re-entered the Vicarage. With the local banker he deposited the jewels till happier days should arise. He also paid into the bank thirty pounds\u2014to be sent to Tess in a few months, as she might require; and wrote to her at her parents\u2019 home in Blackmoor Vale to inform her of what he had done. This amount, with the sum he had already placed in her hands\u2014about fifty pounds\u2014he hoped would be amply sufficient for her wants just at present, particularly as in an emergency she had been directed to apply to his father. He deemed it best not to put his parents into communication with her by informing them of her address; and, being unaware of what had really happened to estrange the two, neither his father nor his mother suggested that he should do so. During the day he left the parsonage, for what he had to complete he wished to get done quickly.", " Surely it was as warmly as ever! He looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought. But he said not a word to her about her revelation, even when they were alone. Could he have had it? Unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing. So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself. Yet he was frank and affectionate as before. Could it be that her doubts were childish? that he forgave her; that he loved her for what she was, just as she was, and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare? Had he really received her note? She glanced into his room, and could see nothing of it. It might be that he forgave her. But even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her. Every morning and night he was the same, and thus New Year\u2019s Eve broke\u2014the wedding day. The lovers did not rise at milking-time, having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her own. When they arrived downstairs at breakfast-time they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it. At some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney-corner to be whitened, and the brick hearth reddened, and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there."], "As represented in the novel, the forces that control human life are ___.": [" Such shiftings often begin in sentiment, and such sentiment sometimes begins in a novel. _July_ 1892.

Sinister design lurked in the woman\u2019s features, a concentrated purpose of revenge on the other sex\u2014so it seemed to him then. The Caroline bodice of the portrait was low\u2014precisely as Tess\u2019s had been when he tucked it in to show the necklace; and again he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between them. The check was sufficient. He resumed his retreat and descended. His air remained calm and cold, his small compressed mouth indexing his powers of self-control; his face wearing still that terrible sterile expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure. It was the face of a man who was no longer passion\u2019s slave, yet who found no advantage in his enfranchisement. He was simply regarding the harrowing contingencies of human experience, the unexpectedness of things. Nothing so pure, so sweet, so virginal as Tess had seemed possible all the long while that he had adored her, up to an hour ago; but The little less, and what worlds away! He argued erroneously when he said to himself that her heart was not indexed in the honest freshness of her face; but Tess had no advocate to set him right.

In another place he was a gentleman who turned Christian for half-an-hour the better to express his grief that a disrespectful phrase about the Immortals should have been used; though the same innate gentility compelled him to excuse the author in words of pity that one cannot be too thankful for: \u201cHe does but give us of his best.\u201d I can assure this great critic that to exclaim illogically against the gods, singular or plural, is not such an original sin of mine as he seems to imagine.", " For this responsiveness I cannot refrain from expressing my thanks; and my regret is that, in a world where one so often hungers in vain for friendship, where even not to be wilfully misunderstood is felt as a kindness, I shall never meet in person these appreciative readers, male and female, and shake them by the hand.

Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name, Clare said\u2014 \u201cOf a Miss Durbeyfield?\u201d \u201cDurbeyfield?\u201d This also was strange to the postman addressed. \u201cThere\u2019s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cand without the name of the house \u2019tis impossible to find \u2019em.\u201d One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated to him. \u201cI know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d\u2019Urberville at The Herons,\u201d said the second. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation. \u201cWhat place is The Herons?\u201d \u201cA stylish lodging-house. \u2019Tis all lodging-houses here, bless \u2019ee.\u201d Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither, arriving with the milkman.", " The Herons, though an ordinary villa, stood in its own grounds, and was certainly the last place in which one would have expected to find lodgings, so private was its appearance. If poor Tess was a servant here, as he feared, she would go to the back-door to that milkman, and he was inclined to go thither also. However, in his doubts he turned to the front, and rang. The hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door. Clare inquired for Teresa d\u2019Urberville or Durbeyfield. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Tess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though she had not adopted his name. \u201cWill you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?\u201d \u201cIt is rather early. What name shall I give, sir?\u201d \u201cAngel.\u201d \u201cMr Angel?\u201d \u201cNo; Angel. It is my Christian name. She\u2019ll understand.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll see if she is awake.\u201d He was shown into the front room\u2014the dining-room\u2014and looked out through the spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons and other shrubs upon it. Obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had feared, and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and sold the jewels to attain it. He did not blame her for one moment. Soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the stairs, at which his heart thumped so painfully that he could hardly stand firm. \u201cDear me! what will she think of me, so altered as I am!\u201d he said to himself; and the door opened.", " I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of your name to d\u2019Urberville, and trace the manifest corruption. And this was the carking secret!\u201d She had not told. At the last moment her courage had failed her; she feared his blame for not telling him sooner; and her instinct of self-preservation was stronger than her candour. \u201cOf course,\u201d continued the unwitting Clare, \u201cI should have been glad to know you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering, dumb, unrecorded rank and file of the English nation, and not from the self-seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the rest. But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you, Tess (he laughed as he spoke), and made selfish likewise. For your own sake I rejoice in your descent. Society is hopelessly snobbish, and this fact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its acceptance of you as my wife, after I have made you the well-read woman that I mean to make you. My mother too, poor soul, will think so much better of you on account of it. Tess, you must spell your name correctly\u2014d\u2019Urberville\u2014from this very day.\u201d \u201cI like the other way rather best.\u201d \u201cBut you _must_, dearest!

By the bye, there\u2019s one of that kidney who has taken the name\u2014where have I heard of him?\u2014Up in the neighbourhood of The Chase, I think.", " How very lovable her face was to him. Yet there was nothing ethereal about it; all was real vitality, real warmth, real incarnation. And it was in her mouth that this culminated. Eyes almost as deep and speaking he had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair; brows as arched, a chin and throat almost as shapely; her mouth he had seen nothing to equal on the face of the earth. To a young man with the least fire in him that little upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting, infatuating, maddening. He had never before seen a woman\u2019s lips and teeth which forced upon his mind with such persistent iteration the old Elizabethan simile of roses filled with snow. Perfect, he, as a lover, might have called them off-hand. But no\u2014they were not perfect. And it was the touch of the imperfect upon the would-be perfect that gave the sweetness, because it was that which gave the humanity. Clare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could reproduce them mentally with ease: and now, as they again confronted him, clothed with colour and life, they sent an _aura_ over his flesh, a breeze through his nerves, which well nigh produced a qualm; and actually produced, by some mysterious physiological process, a prosaic sneeze. She then became conscious that he was observing her; but she would not show it by any change of position, though the curious dream-like fixity disappeared, and a close eye might easily have discerned that the rosiness of her face deepened, and then faded till only a tinge of it was left."], "What animals does Tess find in the woods, maimed by hunters and suffering?": [" When the chants came on, one of her favourites happened to be chosen among the rest\u2014the old double chant \u201cLangdon\u201d\u2014but she did not know what it was called, though she would much have liked to know. She thought, without exactly wording the thought, how strange and god-like was a composer\u2019s power, who from the grave could lead through sequences of emotion, which he alone had felt at first, a girl like her who had never heard of his name, and never would have a clue to his personality. The people who had turned their heads turned them again as the service proceeded; and at last observing her, they whispered to each other. She knew what their whispers were about, grew sick at heart, and felt that she could come to church no more. The bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her retreat more continually than ever. Here, under her few square yards of thatch, she watched winds, and snows, and rains, gorgeous sunsets, and successive moons at their full. So close kept she that at length almost everybody thought she had gone away. The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary. She knew how to hit to a hair\u2019s-breadth that moment of evening when the light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of day and the suspense of night neutralize each other, leaving absolute mental liberty.", " I hope that will not be the case; so that it may happen that I write first to you.\u201d \u201cI agree to the conditions, Angel; because you know best what my punishment ought to be; only\u2014only\u2014don\u2019t make it more than I can bear!\u201d That was all she said on the matter. If Tess had been artful, had she made a scene, fainted, wept hysterically, in that lonely lane, notwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was possessed, he would probably not have withstood her. But her mood of long-suffering made his way easy for him, and she herself was his best advocate. Pride, too, entered into her submission\u2014which perhaps was a symptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too apparent in the whole d\u2019Urberville family\u2014and the many effective chords which she could have stirred by an appeal were left untouched. The remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only. He now handed her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which he had obtained from his bankers for the purpose. The brilliants, the interest in which seemed to be Tess\u2019s for her life only (if he understood the wording of the will), he advised her to let him send to a bank for safety; and to this she readily agreed. These things arranged, he walked with Tess back to the carriage, and handed her in. The coachman was paid and told where to drive her. Taking next his own bag and umbrella\u2014the sole articles he had brought with him hitherwards\u2014he bade her goodbye; and they parted there and then.", " I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of your name to d\u2019Urberville, and trace the manifest corruption.

Her succumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the re-opening the subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work. She lay in a state of percipience without volition, and the rustle of the straw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of bodily touches. She could hear from her corner, in addition to these noises, the murmur of their voices. She felt certain that they were continuing the subject already broached, but their voices were so low that she could not catch the words. At last Tess grew more and more anxious to know what they were saying, and, persuading herself that she felt better, she got up and resumed work. Then Izz Huett broke down. She had walked more than a dozen miles the previous evening, had gone to bed at midnight, and had risen again at five o\u2019clock. Marian alone, thanks to her bottle of liquor and her stoutness of build, stood the strain upon back and arms without suffering. Tess urged Izz to leave off, agreeing, as she felt better, to finish the day without her, and make equal division of the number of sheaves. Izz accepted the offer gratefully, and disappeared through the great door into the snowy track to her lodging."], "What symbol is used to convey both the majestic grandeur and the lifeless hollowness of an aristocratic name?": [" Conning for an hour in the British Museum the pages of works devoted to extinct, half-extinct, obscured, and ruined families appertaining to the quarter of England in which he proposed to settle, he considered that _d\u2019Urberville_ looked and sounded as well as any of them: and d\u2019Urberville accordingly was annexed to his own name for himself and his heirs eternally. Yet he was not an extravagant-minded man in this, and in constructing his family tree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his inter-marriages and aristocratic links, never inserting a single title above a rank of strict moderation. Of this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally in ignorance\u2014much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very possibility of such annexations was unknown to them; who supposed that, though to be well-favoured might be the gift of fortune, a family name came by nature. Tess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge, hardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere, when a figure came forth from the dark triangular door of the tent. It was that of a tall young man, smoking. He had an almost swarthy complexion, with full lips, badly moulded, though red and smooth, above which was a well-groomed black moustache with curled points, though his age could not be more than three- or four-and-twenty. Despite the touches of barbarism in his contours, there was a singular force in the gentleman\u2019s face, and in his bold rolling eye.", " Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o\u2019clock he entered and went to bed. Before putting out his light he re-read Tess\u2019s impassioned letter. Sleep, however, he could not\u2014so near her, yet so far from her\u2014and he continually lifted the window-blind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses, and wondered behind which of the sashes she reposed at that moment. He might almost as well have sat up all night. In the morning he arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of the chief post-office.

He had divined her chief anxiety. Since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate. \u201cIf your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?\u201d \u201cHe can with my assistance.

I\u2019ve undeceived him.\u201d \u201cThe more fool you!\u201d D\u2019Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away. Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; she wondered if he had gone back to her father\u2019s house; and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards. Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters. \u201cO, Tessy\u2014what do you think! \u2019Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there\u2019s a lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think father is dead!\u201d The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till, beholding the effect produced upon her, she said\u2014 \u201cWhat, Tess, shan\u2019t we talk to father never no more?\u201d \u201cBut father was only a little bit ill!\u201d exclaimed Tess distractedly.", " But, before venturing to make the revelation, dubious Tess indirectly sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon Mr Clare, by asking the former if Mr Clare had any great respect for old county families when they had lost all their money and land. \u201cMr Clare,\u201d said the dairyman emphatically, \u201cis one of the most rebellest rozums you ever knowed\u2014not a bit like the rest of his family; and if there\u2019s one thing that he do hate more than another \u2019tis the notion of what\u2019s called a\u2019 old family. He says that it stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in past days, and can\u2019t have anything left in \u2019em now. There\u2019s the Billets and the Drenkhards and the Greys and the St Quintins and the Hardys and the Goulds, who used to own the lands for miles down this valley; you could buy \u2019em all up now for an old song a\u2019most.

Well, Mr Clare found this out, and spoke quite scornful to the poor girl for days. \u2018Ah!\u2019 he says to her, \u2018you\u2019ll never make a good dairymaid! All your skill was used up ages ago in Palestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength for more deeds!\u2019 A boy came here t\u2019other day asking for a job, and said his name was Matt, and when we asked him his surname he said he\u2019d never heard that \u2019a had any surname, and when we asked why, he said he supposed his folks hadn\u2019t been \u2019stablished long enough."], "Who surprises John Durbeyfield by calling him \u201cSir John\u201d?": [" And in the bottom o\u2019 the carriage they be to put a noggin o\u2019 rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up to my account.

When Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his own way, and hardly knew that he loved her still. XXXVIII As she drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and the landscape of her youth began to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor. Her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents? She reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the village.

He occasionally gave a smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything in particular. An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off. Presently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering tune. \u201cGood night t\u2019ee,\u201d said the man with the basket. \u201cGood night, Sir John,\u201d said the parson.

Why, your da\u2019ter is one o\u2019 the members.\u201d \u201cTo be sure\u2014I\u2019d quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things! Well, vamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and maybe I\u2019ll drive round and inspect the club.\u201d The lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies in the evening sun. Not a soul passed that way for a long while, and the faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within the rim of blue hills.", " Then there was the hissing of a train, which drew up almost silently upon the wet rails, and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into the truck. The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess Durbeyfield\u2019s figure, motionless under the great holly tree. No object could have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and wheels than this unsophisticated girl, with the round bare arms, the rainy face and hair, the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at pause, the print gown of no date or fashion, and the cotton bonnet drooping on her brow. She mounted again beside her lover, with a mute obedience characteristic of impassioned natures at times, and when they had wrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again, they plunged back into the now thick night. Tess was so receptive that the few minutes of contact with the whirl of material progress lingered in her thought. \u201cLondoners will drink it at their breakfasts to-morrow, won\u2019t they?\u201d she asked. \u201cStrange people that we have never seen.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014I suppose they will. Though not as we send it.

I want \u2019ee to go on an errand for me.\u201d The lath-like stripling frowned. \u201cWho be you, then, John Durbeyfield, to order me about and call me \u2018boy\u2019?

The lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from crown to toe. \u201cSir John d\u2019Urberville\u2014that\u2019s who I am,\u201d continued the prostrate man. \u201cThat is if knights were baronets\u2014which they be. \u2019Tis recorded in history all about me.

Under the church of that there parish lie my ancestors\u2014hundreds of \u2019em\u2014in coats of mail and jewels, in gr\u2019t lead coffins weighing tons and tons. There\u2019s not a man in the county o\u2019 South-Wessex that\u2019s got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I.\u201d \u201cOh?\u201d \u201cNow take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you\u2019ve come to The Pure Drop Inn, tell \u2019em to send a horse and carriage to me immed\u2019ately, to carry me hwome."], "When Tess and the other girls are at the festival, who do they encounter?": [" It is true that my neighbour Chant\u2019s daughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the Communion-table\u2014alter, as I was shocked to hear her call it one day\u2014with flowers and other stuff on festival occasions. But her father, who is quite as opposed to such flummery as I, says that can be cured. It is a mere girlish outbreak which, I am sure, will not be permanent.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; Mercy is good and devout, I know. But, father, don\u2019t you think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant, but one who, in place of that lady\u2019s ecclesiastical accomplishments, understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself, would suit me infinitely better?\u201d His father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer\u2019s wife\u2019s duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father\u2019s feelings and to advance the cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious. He said that fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist, and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind. He would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low Church School of his father; but she would probably be open to conviction on that point; she was a regular church-goer of simple faith; honest-hearted, receptive, intelligent, graceful to a degree, chaste as a vestal, and, in personal appearance, exceptionally beautiful.", " Despite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with a conscience. Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss; but a woman living her precious life\u2014a life which, to herself who endured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension as the life of the mightiest to himself. Upon her sensations the whole world depended to Tess; through her existence all her fellow-creatures existed, to her. The universe itself only came into being for Tess on the particular day in the particular year in which she was born. This consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single opportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic First Cause\u2014her all; her every and only chance. How then should he look upon her as of less consequence than himself; as a pretty trifle to caress and grow weary of; and not deal in the greatest seriousness with the affection which he knew that he had awakened in her\u2014so fervid and so impressionable as she was under her reserve\u2014in order that it might not agonize and wreck her? To encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop what had begun. Living in such close relations, to meet meant to fall into endearment; flesh and blood could not resist it; and, having arrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency, he decided to hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be mutually engaged.", " \u201cI think I have finished her, however, though she made my fingers ache.\u201d Tess could then see him at full length. He wore the ordinary white pinner and leather leggings of a dairy-farmer when milking, and his boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but this was all his local livery. Beneath it was something educated, reserved, subtle, sad, differing. But the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by the discovery that he was one whom she had seen before. Such vicissitudes had Tess passed through since that time that for a moment she could not remember where she had met him; and then it flashed upon her that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the club-dance at Marlott\u2014the passing stranger who had come she knew not whence, had danced with others but not with her, and slightingly left her, and gone on his way with his friends. The flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest, recognizing her also, he should by some means discover her story. But it passed away when she found no sign of remembrance in him. She saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man\u2019s shapely moustache and beard\u2014the latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root.", " All the way along to this point her heart had been heavy with an inactive sorrow; now there was a change in the quality of its trouble. That hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still engirdled her. It intensified her consciousness of error to a practical despair; the break of continuity between her earlier and present existence, which she had hoped for, had not, after all, taken place. Bygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself. Thus absorbed, she recrossed the northern part of Long-Ash Lane at right angles, and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay. Its dry pale surface stretched severely onward, unbroken by a single figure, vehicle, or mark, save some occasional brown horse-droppings which dotted its cold aridity here and there. While slowly breasting this ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her, and turning she saw approaching that well-known form\u2014so strangely accoutred as the Methodist\u2014the one personage in all the world she wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave. There was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and she yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake her. She saw that he was excited, less by the speed of his walk than by the feelings within him."], "Where does Mrs. Durbeyfield hide her copy of the Compleat Fortune-Teller?": [" \u201cBut where _is_ father?\u201d she asked again. Her mother put on a deprecating look. \u201cNow don\u2019t you be bursting out angry! The poor man\u2014he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the pa\u2019son\u2019s news\u2014that he went up to Rolliver\u2019s half an hour ago. He do want to get up his strength for his journey to-morrow with that load of beehives, which must be delivered, family or no. He\u2019ll have to start shortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long.\u201d \u201cGet up his strength!\u201d said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to her eyes. \u201cO my God! Go to a public-house to get up his strength! And you as well agreed as he, mother!\u201d Her rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room, and to impart a cowed look to the furniture, and candle, and children playing about, and to her mother\u2019s face. \u201cNo,\u201d said the latter touchily, \u201cI be not agreed. I have been waiting for \u2019ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d \u201cO no, Tess. You see, it would be no use.\u201d Tess did not expostulate. She knew what her mother\u2019s objection meant. Mrs Durbeyfield\u2019s jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a chair by her side, in readiness for this contemplated jaunt, the reason for which the matron deplored more than its necessity. \u201cAnd take the _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ to the outhouse,\u201d Joan continued, rapidly wiping her hands, and donning the garments. The _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ was an old thick volume, which lay on a table at her elbow, so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached the edge of the type.", " \u201cOh, \u2019tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield\u2014Lard\u2014how you frightened me!\u2014I thought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover\u2019ment.\u201d Mrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of the conclave, and turned to where her husband sat. He was humming absently to himself, in a low tone: \u201cI be as good as some folks here and there! I\u2019ve got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill, and finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve something to tell \u2019ee that\u2019s come into my head about that\u2014a grand projick!\u201d whispered his cheerful wife. \u201cHere, John, don\u2019t \u2019ee see me?\u201d She nudged him, while he, looking through her as through a window-pane, went on with his recitative. \u201cHush! Don\u2019t \u2019ee sing so loud, my good man,\u201d said the landlady; \u201cin case any member of the Gover\u2019ment should be passing, and take away my licends.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s told \u2019ee what\u2019s happened to us, I suppose?\u201d asked Mrs Durbeyfield. \u201cYes\u2014in a way. D\u2019ye think there\u2019s any money hanging by it?\u201d \u201cAh, that\u2019s the secret,\u201d said Joan Durbeyfield sagely. \u201cHowever, \u2019tis well to be kin to a coach, even if you don\u2019t ride in \u2019en.\u201d She dropped her public voice, and continued in a low tone to her husband: \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking since you brought the news that there\u2019s a great rich lady out by Trantridge, on the edge o\u2019 The Chase, of the name of d\u2019Urberville.\u201d \u201cHey\u2014what\u2019s that?\u201d said Sir John. She repeated the information. \u201cThat lady must be our relation,\u201d she said.", " \u201cI hope it is a chance for earning money. It is no other kind of chance. You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish.\u201d Mrs Durbeyfield did not promise. She was not quite sure that she did not feel proud enough, after the visitor\u2019s remarks, to say a good deal. Thus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready to set out on any day on which she might be required. She was duly informed that Mrs d\u2019Urberville was glad of her decision, and that a spring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of the Vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself prepared to start. Mrs d\u2019Urberville\u2019s handwriting seemed rather masculine. \u201cA cart?\u201d murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. \u201cIt might have been a carriage for her own kin!\u201d Having at last taken her course Tess was less restless and abstracted, going about her business with some self-assurance in the thought of acquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not be onerous. She had hoped to be a teacher at the school, but the fates seemed to decide otherwise. Being mentally older than her mother she did not regard Mrs Durbeyfield\u2019s matrimonial hopes for her in a serious aspect for a moment. The light-minded woman had been discovering good matches for her daughter almost from the year of her birth. VII On the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before dawn\u2014at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute, save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear-voiced conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken.", " Out of that tub had come the day before\u2014Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse\u2014the very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass\u2014which had been wrung up and ironed by her mother\u2019s own hands. As usual, Mrs Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub, the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest child. The cradle-rockers had done hard duty for so many years, under the weight of so many children, on that flagstone floor, that they were worn nearly flat, in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each swing of the cot, flinging the baby from side to side like a weaver\u2019s shuttle, as Mrs Durbeyfield, excited by her song, trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after a long day\u2019s seething in the suds. Nick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched itself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from the matron\u2019s elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the verse, Mrs Durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while. Even now, when burdened with a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune. No ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer world but Tess\u2019s mother caught up its notation in a week. There still faintly beamed from the woman\u2019s features something of the freshness, and even the prettiness, of her youth; rendering it probable that the personal charms which Tess could boast of were in main part her mother\u2019s gift, and therefore unknightly, unhistorical."], "Where does John go to celebrate his newly-discovered noble lineage?": [" The fly moved creepingly up a hill, and Clare watched it go with an unpremeditated hope that Tess would look out of the window for one moment. But that she never thought of doing, would not have ventured to do, lying in a half-dead faint inside. Thus he beheld her recede, and in the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet, with peculiar emendations of his own\u2014 God\u2019s _not_ in his heaven: All\u2019s _wrong_ with the world! When Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his own way, and hardly knew that he loved her still. XXXVIII As she drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and the landscape of her youth began to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor. Her first thought was how would she be able to face her parents? She reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the village. It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who had kept it for many years, and to whom she had been known; he had probably left on New Year\u2019s Day, the date when such changes were made. Having received no intelligence lately from her home, she asked the turnpike-keeper for news. \u201cOh\u2014nothing, miss,\u201d he answered. \u201cMarlott is Marlott still. Folks have died and that.

I don\u2019t see why two branches o\u2019 one family should not be on visiting terms.\u201d \u201cYes; and we\u2019ll all claim kin!\u201d said Abraham brightly from under the bedstead. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with her; and we\u2019ll ride in her coach and wear black clothes!\u201d \u201cHow do you come here, child? What nonsense be ye talking! Go away, and play on the stairs till father and mother be ready!... Well, Tess ought to go to this other member of our family. She\u2019d be sure to win the lady\u2014Tess would; and likely enough \u2019twould lead to some noble gentleman marrying her. In short, I know it.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cI tried her fate in the _Fortune-Teller_, and it brought out that very thing!... You should ha\u2019 seen how pretty she looked to-day; her skin is as sumple as a duchess\u2019.\u201d \u201cWhat says the maid herself to going?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve not asked her.", " She was gathering the buds called \u201clords and ladies\u201d from the bank while he spoke. \u201cWhy do you look so woebegone all of a sudden?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, \u2019tis only\u2014about my own self,\u201d she said, with a frail laugh of sadness, fitfully beginning to peel \u201ca lady\u201d meanwhile. \u201cJust a sense of what might have been with me! My life looks as if it had been wasted for want of chances! When I see what you know, what you have read, and seen, and thought, I feel what a nothing I am! I\u2019m like the poor Queen of Sheba who lived in the Bible. There is no more spirit in me.\u201d \u201cBless my soul, don\u2019t go troubling about that! Why,\u201d he said with some enthusiasm, \u201cI should be only too glad, my dear Tess, to help you to anything in the way of history, or any line of reading you would like to take up\u2014\u201d \u201cIt is a lady again,\u201d interrupted she, holding out the bud she had peeled. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come to peel them.\u201d \u201cNever mind about the lords and ladies. Would you like to take up any course of study\u2014history, for example?\u201d \u201cSometimes I feel I don\u2019t want to know anything more about it than I know already.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cBecause what\u2019s the use of learning that I am one of a long row only\u2014finding out that there is set down in some old book somebody just like me, and to know that I shall only act her part; making me sad, that\u2019s all. The best is not to remember that your nature and your past doings have been just like thousands\u2019 and thousands\u2019, and that your coming life and doings \u2019ll be like thousands\u2019 and thousands\u2019.\u201d \u201cWhat, really, then, you don\u2019t want to learn anything?\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t mind learning why\u2014why the sun do shine on the just and the unjust alike,\u201d she answered, with a slight quaver in her voice.", " Thank God, I was never of no family, and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you be so sure o\u2019 that. From your nater \u2019tis my belief you\u2019ve disgraced yourselves more than any o\u2019 us, and was kings and queens outright at one time.\u201d Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry\u2014\u201cI am afraid father won\u2019t be able to take the journey with the beehives to-morrow so early.\u201d \u201cI? I shall be all right in an hour or two,\u201d said Durbeyfield. It was eleven o\u2019clock before the family were all in bed, and two o\u2019clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives if they were to be delivered to the retailers in Casterbridge before the Saturday market began, the way thither lying by bad roads over a distance of between twenty and thirty miles, and the horse and waggon being of the slowest. At half-past one Mrs Durbeyfield came into the large bedroom where Tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept. \u201cThe poor man can\u2019t go,\u201d she said to her eldest daughter, whose great eyes had opened the moment her mother\u2019s hand touched the door. Tess sat up in bed, lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this information. \u201cBut somebody must go,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt is late for the hives already. Swarming will soon be over for the year; and it we put off taking \u2019em till next week\u2019s market the call for \u2019em will be past, and they\u2019ll be thrown on our hands.\u201d Mrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency.", " They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather older than herself. By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell asleep immediately. But one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful than Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered. The girl\u2019s whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess\u2019s drowsy mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they floated. \u201cMr Angel Clare\u2014he that is learning milking, and that plays the harp\u2014never says much to us. He is a pa\u2019son\u2019s son, and is too much taken up wi\u2019 his own thoughts to notice girls. He is the dairyman\u2019s pupil\u2014learning farming in all its branches. He has learnt sheep-farming at another place, and he\u2019s now mastering dairy-work.... Yes, he is quite the gentleman-born. His father is the Reverend Mr Clare at Emminster\u2014a good many miles from here.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014I have heard of him,\u201d said her companion, now awake. \u201cA very earnest clergyman, is he not?\u201d \u201cYes\u2014that he is\u2014the earnestest man in all Wessex, they say\u2014the last of the old Low Church sort, they tell me\u2014for all about here be what they call High. All his sons, except our Mr Clare, be made pa\u2019sons too.\u201d Tess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present Mr Clare was not made a parson like his brethren, and gradually fell asleep again, the words of her informant coming to her along with the smell of the cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft, and the measured dripping of the whey from the wrings downstairs."], "Tess suggests to Abraham that of the many stars that have planets, their star must be a ___ one.": [" Abraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance than for audition, so that his sister\u2019s abstraction was of no account. He leant back against the hives, and with upturned face made observations on the stars, whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above, in serene dissociation from these two wisps of human life. He asked how far away those twinklers were, and whether God was on the other side of them. But ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed his imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation. If Tess were made rich by marrying a gentleman, would she have money enough to buy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as Nettlecombe-Tout? The renewed subject, which seemed to have impregnated the whole family, filled Tess with impatience. \u201cNever mind that now!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cDid you say the stars were worlds, Tess?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAll like ours?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; but I think so. They sometimes seem to be like the apples on our stubbard-tree. Most of them splendid and sound\u2014a few blighted.\u201d \u201cWhich do we live on\u2014a splendid one or a blighted one?\u201d \u201cA blighted one.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis very unlucky that we didn\u2019t pitch on a sound one, when there were so many more of \u2019em!\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cIs it like that _really_, Tess?\u201d said Abraham, turning to her much impressed, on reconsideration of this rare information. \u201cHow would it have been if we had pitched on a sound one?\u201d \u201cWell, father wouldn\u2019t have coughed and creeped about as he does, and wouldn\u2019t have got too tipsy to go on this journey; and mother wouldn\u2019t have been always washing, and never getting finished.\u201d \u201cAnd you would have been a rich lady ready-made, and not have had to be made rich by marrying a gentleman?\u201d \u201cO Aby, don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t talk of that any more!\u201d Left to his reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy.", " The atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges, arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and Tess showed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood in front of her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay alongside, still and stark; his eyes half open, the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him. \u201c\u2019Tis all my doing\u2014all mine!\u201d the girl cried, gazing at the spectacle. \u201cNo excuse for me\u2014none. What will mother and father live on now? Aby, Aby!\u201d She shook the child, who had slept soundly through the whole disaster. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on with our load\u2014Prince is killed!\u201d When Abraham realized all, the furrows of fifty years were extemporized on his young face. \u201cWhy, I danced and laughed only yesterday!\u201d she went on to herself. \u201cTo think that I was such a fool!\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn\u2019t it, Tess?\u201d murmured Abraham through his tears. In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless. At length a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the driver of the mail-car had been as good as his word. A farmer\u2019s man from near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob. He was harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the load taken on towards Casterbridge.", " Some people would like to know whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure, gets his authority for speaking of \u201cNature\u2019s holy plan.\u201d It grew later, and neither father nor mother reappeared. Tess looked out of the door, and took a mental journey through Marlott. The village was shutting its eyes. Candles and lamps were being put out everywhere: she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand. Her mother\u2019s fetching simply meant one more to fetch. Tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood. \u201cAbraham,\u201d she said to her little brother, \u201cdo you put on your hat\u2014you bain\u2019t afraid?\u2014and go up to Rolliver\u2019s, and see what has gone wi\u2019 father and mother.\u201d The boy jumped promptly from his seat, and opened the door, and the night swallowed him up. Half an hour passed yet again; neither man, woman, nor child returned. Abraham, like his parents, seemed to have been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn. \u201cI must go myself,\u201d she said. \u2019Liza-Lu then went to bed, and Tess, locking them all in, started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when one-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day.", " Abraham, as he more fully awoke (for he had moved in a sort of trance so far), began to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects against the sky; of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing from a lair; of that which resembled a giant\u2019s head. When they had passed the little town of Stourcastle, dumbly somnolent under its thick brown thatch, they reached higher ground. Still higher, on their left, the elevation called Bulbarrow, or Bealbarrow, well-nigh the highest in South Wessex, swelled into the sky, engirdled by its earthen trenches. From hereabout the long road was fairly level for some distance onward. They mounted in front of the waggon, and Abraham grew reflective. \u201cTess!\u201d he said in a preparatory tone, after a silence. \u201cYes, Abraham.\u201d \u201cBain\u2019t you glad that we\u2019ve become gentlefolk?\u201d \u201cNot particular glad.\u201d \u201cBut you be glad that you \u2019m going to marry a gentleman?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Tess, lifting her face. \u201cThat our great relation will help \u2019ee to marry a gentleman.\u201d \u201cI? Our great relation? We have no such relation. What has put that into your head?\u201d \u201cI heard \u2019em talking about it up at Rolliver\u2019s when I went to find father. There\u2019s a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge, and mother said that if you claimed kin with the lady, she\u2019d put \u2019ee in the way of marrying a gentleman.\u201d His sister became abruptly still, and lapsed into a pondering silence."], "What is the name of the horse that dies in the crash during the return from market?": [" Thank God, I was never of no family, and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you be so sure o\u2019 that. From your nater \u2019tis my belief you\u2019ve disgraced yourselves more than any o\u2019 us, and was kings and queens outright at one time.\u201d Tess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her own mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry\u2014\u201cI am afraid father won\u2019t be able to take the journey with the beehives to-morrow so early.\u201d \u201cI?

Supposing that her love had indeed turned to dislike during the last weeks of separation, a sudden meeting might lead to bitter words. Clare therefore thought it would be best to prepare Tess and her family by sending a line to Marlott announcing his return, and his hope that she was still living with them there, as he had arranged for her to do when he left England. He despatched the inquiry that very day, and before the week was out there came a short reply from Mrs Durbeyfield which did not remove his embarrassment, for it bore no address, though to his surprise it was not written from Marlott. Sir, J write these few lines to say that my Daughter is away from me at present, and J am not sure when she will return, but J will let you know as Soon as she do. J do not feel at liberty to tell you Where she is temperly biding. J should say that me and my Family have left Marlott for some Time.\u2014 Yours, J. Durbeyfield It was such a relief to Clare to learn that Tess was at least apparently well that her mother\u2019s stiff reticence as to her whereabouts did not long distress him. They were all angry with him, evidently. He would wait till Mrs Durbeyfield could inform him of Tess\u2019s return, which her letter implied to be soon.", " Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o\u2019clock he entered and went to bed. Before putting out his light he re-read Tess\u2019s impassioned letter. Sleep, however, he could not\u2014so near her, yet so far from her\u2014and he continually lifted the window-blind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses, and wondered behind which of the sashes she reposed at that moment. He might almost as well have sat up all night. In the morning he arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of the chief post-office. At the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with letters for the morning delivery. \u201cDo you know the address of a Mrs Clare?\u201d asked Angel. The postman shook his head. Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name, Clare said\u2014 \u201cOf a Miss Durbeyfield?\u201d \u201cDurbeyfield?\u201d This also was strange to the postman addressed. \u201cThere\u2019s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cand without the name of the house \u2019tis impossible to find \u2019em.\u201d One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated to him. \u201cI know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d\u2019Urberville at The Herons,\u201d said the second. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation. \u201cWhat place is The Herons?\u201d \u201cA stylish lodging-house. \u2019Tis all lodging-houses here, bless \u2019ee.\u201d Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither, arriving with the milkman.", " Now, if you will promise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the bushes till I come to some road or house, and ascertain exactly our whereabouts, I\u2019ll deposit you here willingly. When I come back I\u2019ll give you full directions, and if you insist upon walking you may; or you may ride\u2014at your pleasure.\u201d She accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not till he had stolen a cursory kiss. He sprang down on the other side. \u201cI suppose I must hold the horse?\u201d said she. \u201cOh no; it\u2019s not necessary,\u201d replied Alec, patting the panting creature. \u201cHe\u2019s had enough of it for to-night.\u201d He turned the horse\u2019s head into the bushes, hitched him on to a bough, and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves. \u201cNow, you sit there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe leaves have not got damp as yet. Just give an eye to the horse\u2014it will be quite sufficient.\u201d He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, \u201cBy the bye, Tess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him.\u201d \u201cSomebody? You!\u201d D\u2019Urberville nodded. \u201cO how very good of you that is!\u201d she exclaimed, with a painful sense of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then. \u201cAnd the children have some toys.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2014you ever sent them anything!\u201d she murmured, much moved. \u201cI almost wish you had not\u2014yes, I almost wish it!\u201d \u201cWhy, dear?\u201d \u201cIt\u2014hampers me so.\u201d \u201cTessy\u2014don\u2019t you love me ever so little now?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m grateful,\u201d she reluctantly admitted."], "When Tess goes to the d\u2019Urberville estate, how does it look?": [" Round about were deparked hills and slopes\u2014now cut up into little paddocks\u2014and the green foundations that showed where the d\u2019Urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate. Hard by, the aisle of the church called the d\u2019Urberville Aisle looked on imperturbably. \u201cIsn\u2019t your family vault your own freehold?\u201d said Tess\u2019s mother, as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. \u201cWhy, of course \u2019tis, and that\u2019s where we will camp, girls, till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof! Now, Tess and \u2019Liza and Abraham, you help me. We\u2019ll make a nest for these children, and then we\u2019ll have another look round.\u201d Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building known as the d\u2019Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay. Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of many lights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called the d\u2019Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield\u2019s old seal and spoon. Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it, and put the smaller children inside. \u201cIf it comes to the worst we can sleep there too, for one night,\u201d she said.", " She had come from the manor-house. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville wants the fowls as usual,\u201d she said; but perceiving that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, \u201cMis\u2019ess is a old lady, and blind.\u201d \u201cBlind!\u201d said Tess. Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took, under her companion\u2019s direction, two of the most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures\u2014feathers floating within view of the front, and hen-coops standing on the grass. In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a white-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a large cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges\u2014one sitting on each arm. \u201cAh, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?\u201d said Mrs d\u2019Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. \u201cI hope you will be kind to them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person.", " The incline was the same down which d\u2019Urberville had driven her so wildly on that day in June. Tess went up the remainder of its length without stopping, and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed over the familiar green world beyond, now half-veiled in mist. It was always beautiful from here; it was terribly beautiful to Tess to-day, for since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing, and her views of life had been totally changed for her by the lesson. Verily another girl than the simple one she had been at home was she who, bowed by thought, stood still here, and turned to look behind her. She could not bear to look forward into the Vale. Ascending by the long white road that Tess herself had just laboured up, she saw a two-wheeled vehicle, beside which walked a man, who held up his hand to attract her attention. She obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose, and in a few minutes man and horse stopped beside her. \u201cWhy did you slip away by stealth like this?\u201d said d\u2019Urberville, with upbraiding breathlessness; \u201con a Sunday morning, too, when people were all in bed! I only discovered it by accident, and I have been driving like the deuce to overtake you. Just look at the mare. Why go off like this? You know that nobody wished to hinder your going. And how unnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot, and encumber yourself with this heavy load!", " Tess did not speak to her fellow-worker, nor did he speak to her. Nor did she think of him further than to recollect that he had not been there when it was broad daylight, and that she did not know him as any one of the Marlott labourers, which was no wonder, her absences having been so long and frequent of late years. By-and-by he dug so close to her that the fire-beams were reflected as distinctly from the steel prongs of his fork as from her own. On going up to the fire to throw a pitch of dead weeds upon it, she found that he did the same on the other side. The fire flared up, and she beheld the face of d\u2019Urberville. The unexpectedness of his presence, the grotesqueness of his appearance in a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the most old-fashioned of the labourers, had a ghastly comicality that chilled her as to its bearing. D\u2019Urberville emitted a low, long laugh. \u201cIf I were inclined to joke, I should say, How much this seems like Paradise!\u201d he remarked whimsically, looking at her with an inclined head. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d she weakly asked. \u201cA jester might say this is just like Paradise. You are Eve, and I am the old Other One come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior animal. I used to be quite up in that scene of Milton\u2019s when I was theological. Some of it goes\u2014 \u2018Empress, the way is ready, and not long, Beyond a row of myrtles.... ... If thou accept My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.\u2019 \u2018Lead then,\u2019 said Eve."], "What job does Tess take at the d\u2019Urberville estate?": [" Round about were deparked hills and slopes\u2014now cut up into little paddocks\u2014and the green foundations that showed where the d\u2019Urberville mansion once had stood; also an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the estate. Hard by, the aisle of the church called the d\u2019Urberville Aisle looked on imperturbably. \u201cIsn\u2019t your family vault your own freehold?\u201d said Tess\u2019s mother, as she returned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. \u201cWhy, of course \u2019tis, and that\u2019s where we will camp, girls, till the place of your ancestors finds us a roof! Now, Tess and \u2019Liza and Abraham, you help me. We\u2019ll make a nest for these children, and then we\u2019ll have another look round.\u201d Tess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old four-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and erected under the south wall of the church, the part of the building known as the d\u2019Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay. Over the tester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of many lights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called the d\u2019Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic emblems like those on Durbeyfield\u2019s old seal and spoon. Joan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of it, and put the smaller children inside. \u201cIf it comes to the worst we can sleep there too, for one night,\u201d she said.", " She had come from the manor-house. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville wants the fowls as usual,\u201d she said; but perceiving that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, \u201cMis\u2019ess is a old lady, and blind.\u201d \u201cBlind!\u201d said Tess. Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took, under her companion\u2019s direction, two of the most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures\u2014feathers floating within view of the front, and hen-coops standing on the grass. In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a white-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a large cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges\u2014one sitting on each arm. \u201cAh, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?\u201d said Mrs d\u2019Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. \u201cI hope you will be kind to them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person.", " Against the twilight rises the trapezoidal top of the stack, which has stood forlornly here through the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather. When Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a rustling denoted that others had preceded them; to which, as the light increased, there were presently added the silhouettes of two men on the summit. They were busily \u201cunhaling\u201d the rick, that is, stripping off the thatch before beginning to throw down the sheaves; and while this was in progress Izz and Tess, with the other women-workers, in their whitey-brown pinners, stood waiting and shivering, Farmer Groby having insisted upon their being on the spot thus early to get the job over if possible by the end of the day. Close under the eaves of the stack, and as yet barely visible, was the red tyrant that the women had come to serve\u2014a timber-framed construction, with straps and wheels appertaining\u2014the threshing-machine which, whilst it was going, kept up a despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves. A little way off there was another indistinct figure; this one black, with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve. The long chimney running up beside an ash-tree, and the warmth which radiated from the spot, explained without the necessity of much daylight that here was the engine which was to act as the _primum mobile_ of this little world.", " They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and here they shared their first common meal alone. Such was their childishness, or rather his, that he found it interesting to use the same bread-and-butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her lips with his own. He wondered a little that she did not enter into these frivolities with his own zest. Looking at her silently for a long time; \u201cShe is a dear dear Tess,\u201d he thought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of a difficult passage. \u201cDo I realize solemnly enough how utterly and irretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or bad faith and fortune? I think not. I think I could not, unless I were a woman myself. What I am in worldly estate, she is. What I become, she must become. What I cannot be, she cannot be. And shall I ever neglect her, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her? God forbid such a crime!\u201d They sat on over the tea-table waiting for their luggage, which the dairyman had promised to send before it grew dark. But evening began to close in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought nothing more than they stood in. With the departure of the sun the calm mood of the winter day changed. Out of doors there began noises as of silk smartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding autumn were stirred to irritated resurrection, and whirled about unwillingly, and tapped against the shutters."], "When Alec is driving recklessly, he agrees to slow down if Tess will ___.": [" Ever since the accident with her father\u2019s horse Tess Durbeyfield, courageous as she naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on wheels; the least irregularity of motion startled her. She began to get uneasy at a certain recklessness in her conductor\u2019s driving. \u201cYou will go down slow, sir, I suppose?\u201d she said with attempted unconcern. D\u2019Urberville looked round upon her, nipped his cigar with the tips of his large white centre-teeth, and allowed his lips to smile slowly of themselves. \u201cWhy, Tess,\u201d he answered, after another whiff or two, \u201cit isn\u2019t a brave bouncing girl like you who asks that? Why, I always go down at full gallop. There\u2019s nothing like it for raising your spirits.\u201d \u201cBut perhaps you need not now?\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d he said, shaking his head, \u201cthere are two to be reckoned with. It is not me alone. Tib has to be considered, and she has a very queer temper.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cWhy, this mare. I fancy she looked round at me in a very grim way just then. Didn\u2019t you notice it?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t try to frighten me, sir,\u201d said Tess stiffly. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t. If any living man can manage this horse I can: I won\u2019t say any living man can do it\u2014but if such has the power, I am he.\u201d \u201cWhy do you have such a horse?\u201d \u201cAh, well may you ask it! It was my fate, I suppose. Tib has killed one chap; and just after I bought her she nearly killed me. And then, take my word for it, I nearly killed her. But she\u2019s touchy still, very touchy; and one\u2019s life is hardly safe behind her sometimes.\u201d They were just beginning to descend; and it was evident that the horse, whether of her own will or of his (the latter being the more likely), knew so well the reckless performance expected of her that she hardly required a hint from behind.", " They were all cheerful, and many of them merry. They came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the high road to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of the women said\u2014 \u201cThe Load-a-Lord! Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn\u2019t thy father riding hwome in a carriage!\u201d A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation. She was a fine and handsome girl\u2014not handsomer than some others, possibly\u2014but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape. She wore a red ribbon in her hair, and was the only one of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced adornment. As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzle-headed brawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above her elbows. This was the cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times. Durbeyfield, leaning back, and with his eyes closed luxuriously, was waving his hand above his head, and singing in a slow recitative\u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve-got-a-gr\u2019t-family-vault-at-Kingsbere\u2014and knighted-forefathers-in-lead-coffins-there!\u201d The clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess\u2014in whom a slow heat seemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish in their eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s tired, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said hastily, \u201cand he has got a lift home, because our own horse has to rest to-day.\u201d \u201cBless thy simplicity, Tess,\u201d said her companions.", " The old men on the rising straw-rick talked of the past days when they had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken barn-floor; when everything, even to winnowing, was effected by hand-labour, which, to their thinking, though slow, produced better results. Those, too, on the corn-rick talked a little; but the perspiring ones at the machine, including Tess, could not lighten their duties by the exchange of many words. It was the ceaselessness of the work which tried her so severely, and began to make her wish that she had never some to Flintcomb-Ash. The women on the corn-rick\u2014Marian, who was one of them, in particular\u2014could stop to drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then, or to exchange a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the fragments of straw and husk from their clothing; but for Tess there was no respite; for, as the drum never stopped, the man who fed it could not stop, and she, who had to supply the man with untied sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places with her, which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby\u2019s objections that she was too slow-handed for a feeder. For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was chosen for this particular duty, and Groby gave as his motive in selecting Tess that she was one of those who best combined strength with quickness in untying, and both with staying power, and this may have been true.", " But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere.\u201d The man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash-pale at his intelligence. Her mother looked hopelessly at fault. \u201cWhat shall we do now, Tess?\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cHere\u2019s a welcome to your ancestors\u2019 lands! However, let\u2019s try further.\u201d They moved on into the town, and tried with all their might, Tess remaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her mother and \u2019Liza-Lu made inquiries. At the last return of Joan to the vehicle, an hour later, when her search for accommodation had still been fruitless, the driver of the waggon said the goods must be unloaded, as the horses were half-dead, and he was bound to return part of the way at least that night. \u201cVery well\u2014unload it here,\u201d said Joan recklessly. \u201cI\u2019ll get shelter somewhere.\u201d The waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall, in a spot screened from view, and the driver, nothing loth, soon hauled down the poor heap of household goods. This done, she paid him, reducing herself to almost her last shilling thereby, and he moved off and left them, only too glad to get out of further dealings with such a family. It was a dry night, and he guessed that they would come to no harm. Tess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture. The cold sunlight of this spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and kettles, upon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze, upon the brass handles of the dresser, upon the wicker-cradle they had all been rocked in, and upon the well-rubbed clock-case, all of which gave out the reproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to the vicissitudes of a roofless exposure for which they were never made."], "Who agrees to help Tess learn how to blow whistles?": [" But she was such a sheaf of susceptibilities that her pulse was accelerated by the touch, her blood driven to her finger-ends, and the cool arms flushed hot. Then, as though her heart had said, \u201cIs coyness longer necessary? Truth is truth between man and woman, as between man and man,\u201d she lifted her eyes and they beamed devotedly into his, as her lip rose in a tender half-smile. \u201cDo you know why I did that, Tess?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you love me very much!\u201d \u201cYes, and as a preliminary to a new entreaty.\u201d \u201cNot _again_!\u201d She looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under her own desire. \u201cO, Tessy!\u201d he went on, \u201cI _cannot_ think why you are so tantalizing. Why do you disappoint me so? You seem almost like a coquette, upon my life you do\u2014a coquette of the first urban water! They blow hot and blow cold, just as you do, and it is the very last sort of thing to expect to find in a retreat like Talbothays.... And yet, dearest,\u201d he quickly added, observing how the remark had cut her, \u201cI know you to be the most honest, spotless creature that ever lived. So how can I suppose you a flirt? Tess, why don\u2019t you like the idea of being my wife, if you love me as you seem to do?\u201d \u201cI have never said I don\u2019t like the idea, and I never could say it; because\u2014it isn\u2019t true!\u201d The stress now getting beyond endurance, her lip quivered, and she was obliged to go away. Clare was so pained and perplexed that he ran after and caught her in the passage.", " Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it; and then her mother broached her scheme. \u201cWe must take the ups wi\u2019 the downs, Tess,\u201d said she; \u201cand never could your high blood have been found out at a more called-for moment.

You must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some help in our trouble.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t care to do that,\u201d says Tess. \u201cIf there is such a lady, \u2019twould be enough for us if she were friendly\u2014not to expect her to give us help.\u201d \u201cYou could win her round to do anything, my dear. Besides, perhaps there\u2019s more in it than you know of. I\u2019ve heard what I\u2019ve heard, good-now.\u201d The oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish; but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful profit. Her mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered that this Mrs d\u2019Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity. But Tess\u2019s pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her. \u201cI\u2019d rather try to get work,\u201d she murmured. \u201cDurbeyfield, you can settle it,\u201d said his wife, turning to where he sat in the background.", " I, at any rate, try to help you out of trouble, but he does not, bless his invisible face! The words of the stern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me. Don\u2019t you know them, Tess?\u2014\u2018And she shall follow after her lover, but she shall not overtake him; and she shall seek him, but shall not find him; then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now!\u2019 ... Tess, my trap is waiting just under the hill, and\u2014darling mine, not his!\u2014you know the rest.\u201d Her face had been rising to a dull crimson fire while he spoke; but she did not answer. \u201cYou have been the cause of my backsliding,\u201d he continued, stretching his arm towards her waist; \u201cyou should be willing to share it, and leave that mule you call husband for ever.\u201d One of her leather gloves, which she had taken off to eat her skimmer-cake, lay in her lap, and without the slightest warning she passionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face. It was heavy and thick as a warrior\u2019s, and it struck him flat on the mouth. Fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of a trick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised. Alec fiercely started up from his reclining position. A scarlet oozing appeared where her blow had alighted, and in a moment the blood began dropping from his mouth upon the straw. But he soon controlled himself, calmly drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and mopped his bleeding lips.", " D\u2019Urberville pulled up, and said he would get it for her, but Tess was down on the other side. She turned back and picked up the article. \u201cYou look prettier with it off, upon my soul, if that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, contemplating her over the back of the vehicle. \u201cNow then, up again! What\u2019s the matter?\u201d The hat was in place and tied, but Tess had not stepped forward. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d she said, revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her eye lit in defiant triumph; \u201cnot again, if I know it!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2014you won\u2019t get up beside me?\u201d \u201cNo; I shall walk.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care if \u2019tis dozens.

I\u2019ll swear you did!\u201d Her strategic silence confirmed his suspicion. Then d\u2019Urberville cursed and swore at her, and called her everything he could think of for the trick. Turning the horse suddenly he tried to drive back upon her, and so hem her in between the gig and the hedge. But he could not do this short of injuring her. \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words!\u201d cried Tess with spirit, from the top of the hedge into which she had scrambled. \u201cI don\u2019t like \u2019ee at all! I hate and detest you! I\u2019ll go back to mother, I will!\u201d D\u2019Urberville\u2019s bad temper cleared up at sight of hers; and he laughed heartily. \u201cWell, I like you all the better,\u201d he said."], "When Tess\u2019s friends get drunk, why are they irritated with Tess?": [" Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it; and then her mother broached her scheme. \u201cWe must take the ups wi\u2019 the downs, Tess,\u201d said she; \u201cand never could your high blood have been found out at a more called-for moment.

The charms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated, and she only received them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled. She remained mute, not knowing that he was smothering his affection for her. She hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek, a tear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it rolled, like the object lens of a microscope. Meanwhile reillumination as to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in his life, in his universe, returned to him, and he tried desperately to advance among the new conditions in which he stood. Some consequent action was necessary; yet what? \u201cTess,\u201d he said, as gently as he could speak, \u201cI cannot stay\u2014in this room\u2014just now.

This was what their _Agape_ had come to. At tea, two or three hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of affection, drunk from one cup. The closing of the door behind him, gently as it had been pulled to, roused Tess from her stupor. He was gone; she could not stay. Hastily flinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed, putting out the candles as if she were never coming back.", " She don\u2019t know there is any such lady-relation yet.

Leave her to me.\u201d Though this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import reached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the Durbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks had, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine prospects in store. \u201cTess is a fine figure o\u2019 fun, as I said to myself to-day when I zeed her vamping round parish with the rest,\u201d observed one of the elderly boozers in an undertone. \u201cBut Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she don\u2019t get green malt in floor.\u201d It was a local phrase which had a peculiar meaning, and there was no reply.

Her father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality. \u201cI will go,\u201d said Tess at last. Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision conjured up by the girl\u2019s consent. \u201cThat\u2019s right! For such a pretty maid as \u2019tis, this is a fine chance!\u201d Tess smiled crossly.", " But to know that things were in train was an immense relief to Tess notwithstanding, who had well-nigh feared that somebody would stand up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history. How events were favouring her! \u201cI don\u2019t quite feel easy,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cAll this good fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill. That\u2019s how Heaven mostly does. I wish I could have had common banns!\u201d But everything went smoothly. She wondered whether he would like her to be married in her present best white frock, or if she ought to buy a new one. The question was set at rest by his forethought, disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her. Inside them she found a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to shoes, including a perfect morning costume, such as would well suit the simple wedding they planned. He entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages, and heard her upstairs undoing them. A minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her eyes. \u201cHow thoughtful you\u2019ve been!\u201d she murmured, her cheek upon his shoulder. \u201cEven to the gloves and handkerchief! My own love\u2014how good, how kind!\u201d \u201cNo, no, Tess; just an order to a tradeswoman in London\u2014nothing more.\u201d And to divert her from thinking too highly of him, he told her to go upstairs, and take her time, and see if it all fitted; and, if not, to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations.", " They heard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out to her full pace. Even Izz hoped she would win, and, though without any particular respect for her own virtue, felt glad that she had been prevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by Clare. It was a year ago, all but a day, that Clare had married Tess, and only a few days less than a year that he had been absent from her. Still, to start on a brisk walk, and on such an errand as hers, on a dry clear wintry morning, through the rarefied air of these chalky hogs\u2019-backs, was not depressing; and there is no doubt that her dream at starting was to win the heart of her mother-in-law, tell her whole history to that lady, enlist her on her side, and so gain back the truant. In time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which stretched the loamy Vale of Blackmoor, now lying misty and still in the dawn. Instead of the colourless air of the uplands, the atmosphere down there was a deep blue. Instead of the great enclosures of a hundred acres in which she was now accustomed to toil, there were little fields below her of less than half-a-dozen acres, so numerous that they looked from this height like the meshes of a net. Here the landscape was whitey-brown; down there, as in Froom Valley, it was always green. Yet it was in that vale that her sorrow had taken shape, and she did not love it as formerly.", " \u201cAbout the children\u2014your brothers and sisters,\u201d he resumed. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of them.\u201d Tess\u2019s heart quivered\u2014he was touching her in a weak place. He had divined her chief anxiety. Since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate. \u201cIf your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?\u201d \u201cHe can with my assistance. He must!\u201d \u201cAnd with mine.\u201d \u201cNo, sir!\u201d \u201cHow damned foolish this is!\u201d burst out d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhy, he thinks we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!\u201d \u201cHe don\u2019t. I\u2019ve undeceived him.\u201d \u201cThe more fool you!\u201d D\u2019Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away. Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; she wondered if he had gone back to her father\u2019s house; and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards. Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters. \u201cO, Tessy\u2014what do you think! \u2019Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there\u2019s a lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think father is dead!\u201d The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till, beholding the effect produced upon her, she said\u2014 \u201cWhat, Tess, shan\u2019t we talk to father never no more?\u201d \u201cBut father was only a little bit ill!\u201d exclaimed Tess distractedly."], "What is Tess doing when Alec first takes advantage of her sexually?": [" The brim-fulness of her nature breathed from her. It was a moment when a woman\u2019s soul is more incarnate than at any other time; when the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself flesh; and sex takes the outside place in the presentation. Then those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness, before the remainder of her face was well awake. With an oddly compounded look of gladness, shyness, and surprise, she exclaimed\u2014\u201cO Mr Clare! How you frightened me\u2014I\u2014\u201d There had not at first been time for her to think of the changed relations which his declaration had introduced; but the full sense of the matter rose up in her face when she encountered Clare\u2019s tender look as he stepped forward to the bottom stair. \u201cDear, darling Tessy!\u201d he whispered, putting his arm round her, and his face to her flushed cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t, for Heaven\u2019s sake, Mister me any more. I have hastened back so soon because of you!\u201d Tess\u2019s excitable heart beat against his by way of reply; and there they stood upon the red-brick floor of the entry, the sun slanting in by the window upon his back, as he held her tightly to his breast; upon her inclining face, upon the blue veins of her temple, upon her naked arm, and her neck, and into the depths of her hair. Having been lying down in her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat. At first she would not look straight up at him, but her eyes soon lifted, and his plumbed the deepness of the ever-varying pupils, with their radiating fibrils of blue, and black, and gray, and violet, while she regarded him as Eve at her second waking might have regarded Adam.", " \u201cBut let us try further on, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess, what\u2019s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!\u201d Accompanied by \u2019Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. \u201cAh\u2014I\u2019m looking for you!\u201d he said, riding up to them. \u201cThis is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!\u201d It was Alec d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhere is Tess?\u201d he asked. Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the direction of the church, and went on, d\u2019Urberville saying that he would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone, d\u2019Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot. In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead, remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall. The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first time in her life. Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff.", " As the last duty before leaving this part of England it was necessary for him to call at the Wellbridge farmhouse, in which he had spent with Tess the first three days of their marriage, the trifle of rent having to be paid, the key given up of the rooms they had occupied, and two or three small articles fetched away that they had left behind. It was under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown upon his life had stretched its gloom over him. Yet when he had unlocked the door of the sitting-room and looked into it, the memory which returned first upon him was that of their happy arrival on a similar afternoon, the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation conjointly, the first meal together, the chatting by the fire with joined hands. The farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit, and Clare was in the rooms alone for some time. Inwardly swollen with a renewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with, he went upstairs to her chamber, which had never been his. The bed was smooth as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of leaving. The mistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed it. Having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour, and the leaves and berries were wrinkled. Angel took it down and crushed it into the grate. Standing there, he for the first time doubted whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise, much less a generous, one.", " When she came in her mother pursued her advantage. \u201cWell, what be you going to do?\u201d she asked. \u201cI wish I had seen Mrs d\u2019Urberville,\u201d said Tess. \u201cI think you mid as well settle it. Then you\u2019ll see her soon enough.\u201d Her father coughed in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say!\u201d answered the girl restlessly. \u201cIt is for you to decide. I killed the old horse, and I suppose I ought to do something to get ye a new one. But\u2014but\u2014I don\u2019t quite like Mr d\u2019Urberville being there!\u201d The children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by their wealthy kinsfolk (which they imagined the other family to be) as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry at Tess\u2019s reluctance, and teased and reproached her for hesitating. \u201cTess won\u2019t go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy of!\u2014no, she says she wo-o-on\u2019t!\u201d they wailed, with square mouths. \u201cAnd we shan\u2019t have a nice new horse, and lots o\u2019 golden money to buy fairlings! And Tess won\u2019t look pretty in her best cloze no mo-o-ore!\u201d Her mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them indefinitely, also weighed in the argument. Her father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality. \u201cI will go,\u201d said Tess at last. Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision conjured up by the girl\u2019s consent. \u201cThat\u2019s right! For such a pretty maid as \u2019tis, this is a fine chance!\u201d Tess smiled crossly."], "What does the sign painter stop to paint when he\u2019s talking with Tess?": [" The old men on the rising straw-rick talked of the past days when they had been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken barn-floor; when everything, even to winnowing, was effected by hand-labour, which, to their thinking, though slow, produced better results. Those, too, on the corn-rick talked a little; but the perspiring ones at the machine, including Tess, could not lighten their duties by the exchange of many words. It was the ceaselessness of the work which tried her so severely, and began to make her wish that she had never some to Flintcomb-Ash. The women on the corn-rick\u2014Marian, who was one of them, in particular\u2014could stop to drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now and then, or to exchange a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their faces or cleared the fragments of straw and husk from their clothing; but for Tess there was no respite; for, as the drum never stopped, the man who fed it could not stop, and she, who had to supply the man with untied sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places with her, which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby\u2019s objections that she was too slow-handed for a feeder. For some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was chosen for this particular duty, and Groby gave as his motive in selecting Tess that she was one of those who best combined strength with quickness in untying, and both with staying power, and this may have been true.", " The kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealed\u2014the stubble scratches upon her wrists, and the weariness of her eyes\u2014her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing, showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity which was almost regal. The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy eyes blinking and red, awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active. The most impressed of them said: \u201cBe you really going to christen him, Tess?\u201d The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name going to be?\u201d She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service, and now she pronounced it: \u201cSORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d She sprinkled the water, and there was silence. \u201cSay \u2018Amen,\u2019 children.\u201d The tiny voices piped in obedient response, \u201cAmen!\u201d Tess went on: \u201cWe receive this child\u201d\u2014and so forth\u2014\u201cand do sign him with the sign of the Cross.\u201d Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life\u2019s end.", " There was not a human soul near. Sad October and her sadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that lane. As she walked, however, some footsteps approached behind her, the footsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his advance he was close at her heels and had said \u201cGood morning\u201d before she had been long aware of his propinquity. He appeared to be an artisan of some sort, and carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand. He asked in a business-like manner if he should take her basket, which she permitted him to do, walking beside him. \u201cIt is early to be astir this Sabbath morn!\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess. \u201cWhen most people are at rest from their week\u2019s work.\u201d She also assented to this. \u201cThough I do more real work to-day than all the week besides.\u201d \u201cDo you?\u201d \u201cAll the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the glory of God. That\u2019s more real than the other\u2014hey?

He set down her basket and the tin pot, and stirring the paint with the brush that was in it began painting large square letters on the middle board of the three composing the stile, placing a comma after each word, as if to give pause while that word was driven well home to the reader\u2019s heart\u2014 THY, DAMNATION, SLUMBERETH, NOT.", " It was from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair.

She soon rose from table, and, with an impression that Clare would soon follow her, went along a little wriggling path, now stepping to one side of the irrigating channels, and now to the other, till she stood by the main stream of the Var. Men had been cutting the water-weeds higher up the river, and masses of them were floating past her\u2014moving islands of green crow-foot, whereon she might almost have ridden; long locks of which weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows from crossing. Yes, there was the pain of it. This question of a woman telling her story\u2014the heaviest of crosses to herself\u2014seemed but amusement to others.

Tess could eventually join him there, and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem impracticable to him here. In brief he was strongly inclined to try Brazil, especially as the season for going thither was just at hand. With this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan to his parents, and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated them. As he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face, just as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks; but his face was thinner now. Clare had given his parents no warning of his visit, and his arrival stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher stirs a quiet pool. His father and mother were both in the drawing-room, but neither of his brothers was now at home. Angel entered, and closed the door quietly behind him. \u201cBut\u2014where\u2019s your wife, dear Angel?\u201d cried his mother. \u201cHow you surprise us!\u201d \u201cShe is at her mother\u2019s\u2014temporarily.

Some man, apparently the sexton, had observed Clare standing there, and drew nigh. \u201cAh, sir, now that\u2019s a man who didn\u2019t want to lie here, but wished to be carried to Kingsbere, where his ancestors be.\u201d \u201cAnd why didn\u2019t they respect his wish?\u201d \u201cOh\u2014no money. Bless your soul, sir, why\u2014there, I wouldn\u2019t wish to say it everywhere, but\u2014even this headstone, for all the flourish wrote upon en, is not paid for.\u201d \u201cAh, who put it up?\u201d The man told the name of a mason in the village, and, on leaving the churchyard, Clare called at the mason\u2019s house. He found that the statement was true, and paid the bill. This done, he turned in the direction of the migrants. The distance was too long for a walk, but Clare felt such a strong desire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance nor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually reach the place. At Shaston, however, he found he must hire; but the way was such that he did not enter Joan\u2019s place till about seven o\u2019clock in the evening, having traversed a distance of over twenty miles since leaving Marlott. The village being small he had little difficulty in finding Mrs Durbeyfield\u2019s tenement, which was a house in a walled garden, remote from the main road, where she had stowed away her clumsy old furniture as best she could. It was plain that for some reason or other she had not wished him to visit her, and he felt his call to be somewhat of an intrusion.", " \u201cYou must zee yourself!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt is much better than you was t\u2019other day.\u201d As the looking-glass was only large enough to reflect a very small portion of Tess\u2019s person at one time, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black cloak outside the casement, and so made a large reflector of the panes, as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do. After this she went downstairs to her husband, who was sitting in the lower room. \u201cI\u2019ll tell \u2019ee what \u2019tis, Durbeyfield,\u201d said she exultingly; \u201che\u2019ll never have the heart not to love her. But whatever you do, don\u2019t zay too much to Tess of his fancy for her, and this chance she has got. She is such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him, or against going there, even now. If all goes well, I shall certainly be for making some return to pa\u2019son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us\u2014dear, good man!\u201d However, as the moment for the girl\u2019s setting out drew nigh, when the first excitement of the dressing had passed off, a slight misgiving found place in Joan Durbeyfield\u2019s mind. It prompted the matron to say that she would walk a little way\u2014as far as to the point where the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to the outer world. At the top Tess was going to be met with the spring-cart sent by the Stoke-d\u2019Urbervilles, and her box had already been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in readiness. Seeing their mother put on her bonnet, the younger children clamoured to go with her.", " She will remain at her mother\u2019s till I come back.\u201d \u201cAnd I shall not see her before you start?\u201d He was afraid they would not. His original plan had been, as he had said, to refrain from bringing her there for some little while\u2014not to wound their prejudices\u2014feelings\u2014in any way; and for other reasons he had adhered to it. He would have to visit home in the course of a year, if he went out at once; and it would be possible for them to see her before he started a second time\u2014with her. A hastily prepared supper was brought in, and Clare made further exposition of his plans. His mother\u2019s disappointment at not seeing the bride still remained with her. Clare\u2019s late enthusiasm for Tess had infected her through her maternal sympathies, till she had almost fancied that a good thing could come out of Nazareth\u2014a charming woman out of Talbothays Dairy. She watched her son as he ate. \u201cCannot you describe her? I am sure she is very pretty, Angel.\u201d \u201cOf that there can be no question!\u201d he said, with a zest which covered its bitterness. \u201cAnd that she is pure and virtuous goes without question?\u201d \u201cPure and virtuous, of course, she is.\u201d \u201cI can see her quite distinctly. You said the other day that she was fine in figure; roundly built; had deep red lips like Cupid\u2019s bow; dark eyelashes and brows, an immense rope of hair like a ship\u2019s cable; and large eyes violety-bluey-blackish.\u201d \u201cI did, mother.\u201d \u201cI quite see her."], "Where does Tess lay her dead baby to rest?": [" \u201cDead, dead, dead!\u201d he murmured. After fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of unmeasurable woe, he bent lower, enclosed her in his arms, and rolled her in the sheet as in a shroud. Then lifting her from the bed with as much respect as one would show to a dead body, he carried her across the room, murmuring\u2014 \u201cMy poor, poor Tess\u2014my dearest, darling Tess! So sweet, so good, so true!\u201d The words of endearment, withheld so severely in his waking hours, were inexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart. If it had been to save her weary life she would not, by moving or struggling, have put an end to the position she found herself in. Thus she lay in absolute stillness, scarcely venturing to breathe, and, wondering what he was going to do with her, suffered herself to be borne out upon the landing. \u201cMy wife\u2014dead, dead!\u201d he said. He paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the banister. Was he going to throw her down? Self-solicitude was near extinction in her, and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart on the morrow, possibly for always, she lay in his arms in this precarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror. If they could only fall together, and both be dashed to pieces, how fit, how desirable. However, he did not let her fall, but took advantage of the support of the handrail to imprint a kiss upon her lips\u2014lips in the day-time scorned.", " When she reached home it was to learn to her grief that the baby had been suddenly taken ill since the afternoon. Some such collapse had been probable, so tender and puny was its frame; but the event came as a shock nevertheless. The baby\u2019s offence against society in coming into the world was forgotten by the girl-mother; her soul\u2019s desire was to continue that offence by preserving the life of the child. However, it soon grew clear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the flesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured. And when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which transcended that of the child\u2019s simple loss. Her baby had not been baptized. Tess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the consideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done, burn she must, and there was an end of it. Like all village girls, she was well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully studied the histories of Aholah and Aholibah, and knew the inferences to be drawn therefrom. But when the same question arose with regard to the baby, it had a very different colour. Her darling was about to die, and no salvation. It was nearly bedtime, but she rushed downstairs and asked if she might send for the parson. The moment happened to be one at which her father\u2019s sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest, and his sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that nobility most pronounced, for he had just returned from his weekly booze at Rolliver\u2019s Inn.", " XXXVII Midnight came and passed silently, for there was nothing to announce it in the Valley of the Froom. Not long after one o\u2019clock there was a slight creak in the darkened farmhouse once the mansion of the d\u2019Urbervilles. Tess, who used the upper chamber, heard it and awoke. It had come from the corner step of the staircase, which, as usual, was loosely nailed. She saw the door of her bedroom open, and the figure of her husband crossed the stream of moonlight with a curiously careful tread. He was in his shirt and trousers only, and her first flush of joy died when she perceived that his eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy. When he reached the middle of the room he stood still and murmured in tones of indescribable sadness\u2014 \u201cDead! dead! dead!\u201d Under the influence of any strongly-disturbing force, Clare would occasionally walk in his sleep, and even perform strange feats, such as he had done on the night of their return from market just before their marriage, when he re-enacted in his bedroom his combat with the man who had insulted her. Tess saw that continued mental distress had wrought him into that somnambulistic state now. Her loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart, that, awake or asleep, he inspired her with no sort of personal fear. If he had entered with a pistol in his hand he would scarcely have disturbed her trust in his protectiveness. Clare came close, and bent over her.", " \u201cO merciful God, have pity; have pity upon my poor baby!\u201d she cried. \u201cHeap as much anger as you want to upon me, and welcome; but pity the child!\u201d She leant against the chest of drawers, and murmured incoherent supplications for a long while, till she suddenly started up. \u201cAh! perhaps baby can be saved! Perhaps it will be just the same!\u201d She spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have shone in the gloom surrounding her. She lit a candle, and went to a second and a third bed under the wall, where she awoke her young sisters and brothers, all of whom occupied the same room. Pulling out the washing-stand so that she could get behind it, she poured some water from a jug, and made them kneel around, putting their hands together with fingers exactly vertical. While the children, scarcely awake, awe-stricken at her manner, their eyes growing larger and larger, remained in this position, she took the baby from her bed\u2014a child\u2019s child\u2014so immature as scarce to seem a sufficient personality to endow its producer with the maternal title. Tess then stood erect with the infant on her arm beside the basin; the next sister held the Prayer-Book open before her, as the clerk at church held it before the parson; and thus the girl set about baptizing her child. Her figure looked singularly tall and imposing as she stood in her long white nightgown, a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging straight down her back to her waist."], "When Tess realizes that she can never be happy at Marlott, what job does she take at Talbothays Dairy?": [" Why, he is the very man who had that rumpus with my father I told you of. What an odd coincidence!\u201d \u201cAngel, I think I would rather not take the name! It is unlucky, perhaps!\u201d She was agitated. \u201cNow then, Mistress Teresa d\u2019Urberville, I have you. Take my name, and so you will escape yours! The secret is out, so why should you any longer refuse me?\u201d \u201cIf it is _sure_ to make you happy to have me as your wife, and you feel that you do wish to marry me, _very, very_ much\u2014\u201d \u201cI do, dearest, of course!\u201d \u201cI mean, that it is only your wanting me very much, and being hardly able to keep alive without me, whatever my offences, that would make me feel I ought to say I will.\u201d \u201cYou will\u2014you do say it, I know! You will be mine for ever and ever.\u201d He clasped her close and kissed her. \u201cYes!\u201d She had no sooner said it than she burst into a dry hard sobbing, so violent that it seemed to rend her. Tess was not a hysterical girl by any means, and he was surprised. \u201cWhy do you cry, dearest?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell\u2014quite!\u2014I am so glad to think\u2014of being yours, and making you happy!\u201d \u201cBut this does not seem very much like gladness, my Tessy!\u201d \u201cI mean\u2014I cry because I have broken down in my vow! I said I would die unmarried!\u201d \u201cBut, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes! But O, I sometimes wish I had never been born!\u201d \u201cNow, my dear Tess, if I did not know that you are very much excited, and very inexperienced, I should say that remark was not very complimentary.", " We discover the latter in changed conditions; instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore, we see her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage, as at an earlier time when she was no bride; instead of the ample means that were projected by her husband for her comfort through this probationary period, she can produce only a flattened purse. After again leaving Marlott, her home, she had got through the spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers, the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairy-work near Port-Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley, equally remote from her native place and from Talbothays. She preferred this to living on his allowance. Mentally she remained in utter stagnation, a condition which the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked. Her consciousness was at that other dairy, at that other season, in the presence of the tender lover who had confronted her there\u2014he who, the moment she had grasped him to keep for her own, had disappeared like a shape in a vision. The dairy-work lasted only till the milk began to lessen, for she had not met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays, but had done duty as a supernumerary only. However, as harvest was now beginning, she had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty of further occupation, and this continued till harvest was done.", " His name she had obviously never used during their separation, and her dignified sense of their total severance was shown not much less by this abstention than by the hardships she had chosen to undergo (of which he now learnt for the first time) rather than apply to his father for more funds. From this place they told him Tess Durbeyfield had gone, without due notice, to the home of her parents on the other side of Blackmoor, and it therefore became necessary to find Mrs Durbeyfield. She had told him she was not now at Marlott, but had been curiously reticent as to her actual address, and the only course was to go to Marlott and inquire for it. The farmer who had been so churlish with Tess was quite smooth-tongued to Clare, and lent him a horse and man to drive him towards Marlott, the gig he had arrived in being sent back to Emminster; for the limit of a day\u2019s journey with that horse was reached. Clare would not accept the loan of the farmer\u2019s vehicle for a further distance than to the outskirts of the Vale, and, sending it back with the man who had driven him, he put up at an inn, and next day entered on foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear Tess\u2019s birth. It was as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the gardens and foliage; the so-called spring was but winter overlaid with a thin coat of greenness, and it was of a parcel with his expectations. The house in which Tess had passed the years of her childhood was now inhabited by another family who had never known her.", " Even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist in a dream. In the afternoon the rain came on again, and Marian said that they need not work any more. But if they did not work they would not be paid; so they worked on. It was so high a situation, this field, that the rain had no occasion to fall, but raced along horizontally upon the yelling wind, sticking into them like glass splinters till they were wet through. Tess had not known till now what was really meant by that. There are degrees of dampness, and a very little is called being wet through in common talk. But to stand working slowly in a field, and feel the creep of rain-water, first in legs and shoulders, then on hips and head, then at back, front, and sides, and yet to work on till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down, demands a distinct modicum of stoicism, even of valour. Yet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed. They were both young, and they were talking of the time when they lived and loved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts; in substance to all, emotionally to these. Tess would fain not have conversed with Marian of the man who was legally, if not actually, her husband; but the irresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating Marian\u2019s remarks. And thus, as has been said, though the damp curtains of their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces, and their wrappers clung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all this afternoon in memories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays."], "Who is the master dairyman at Talbothays?": [" She too had sprung up, but she sank down again. \u201cNow, punish me!\u201d she said, turning up her eyes to him with the hopeless defiance of the sparrow\u2019s gaze before its captor twists its neck. \u201cWhip me, crush me; you need not mind those people under the rick! I shall not cry out. Once victim, always victim\u2014that\u2019s the law!\u201d \u201cO no, no, Tess,\u201d he said blandly. \u201cI can make full allowance for this. Yet you most unjustly forget one thing, that I would have married you if you had not put it out of my power to do so. Did I not ask you flatly to be my wife\u2014hey? Answer me.\u201d \u201cYou did.\u201d \u201cAnd you cannot be. But remember one thing!\u201d His voice hardened as his temper got the better of him with the recollection of his sincerity in asking her and her present ingratitude, and he stepped across to her side and held her by the shoulders, so that she shook under his grasp. \u201cRemember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man\u2019s wife you are mine!\u201d The threshers now began to stir below. \u201cSo much for our quarrel,\u201d he said, letting her go. \u201cNow I shall leave you, and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon. You don\u2019t know me yet! But I know you.\u201d She had not spoken again, remaining as if stunned. D\u2019Urberville retreated over the sheaves, and descended the ladder, while the workers below rose and stretched their arms, and shook down the beer they had drunk. Then the threshing-machine started afresh; and amid the renewed rustle of the straw Tess resumed her position by the buzzing drum as one in a dream, untying sheaf after sheaf in endless succession.", " The male milkers, with hat-brims turned down, resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not observe her. One of these was a sturdy middle-aged man\u2014whose long white \u201cpinner\u201d was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect\u2014the master-dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as a working milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the seventh as a man in shining broad-cloth in his family pew at church, being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme: Dairyman Dick All the week: On Sundays Mister Richard Crick. Seeing Tess standing at gaze he went across to her. The majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time, but it happened that Mr Crick was glad to get a new hand\u2014for the days were busy ones now\u2014and he received her warmly; inquiring for her mother and the rest of the family\u2014(though this as a matter of form merely, for in reality he had not been aware of Mrs Durbeyfield\u2019s existence till apprised of the fact by a brief business-letter about Tess). \u201cOh\u2014ay, as a lad I knowed your part o\u2019 the country very well,\u201d he said terminatively. \u201cThough I\u2019ve never been there since. And a aged woman of ninety that use to live nigh here, but is dead and gone long ago, told me that a family of some such name as yours in Blackmoor Vale came originally from these parts, and that \u2019twere a old ancient race that had all but perished off the earth\u2014though the new generations didn\u2019t know it.", " Dairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house. He had received a letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter had a twang. \u201cAnd begad, so \u2019t have!\u201d said the dairyman, who held in his left hand a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. \u201cYes\u2014taste for yourself!\u201d Several of them gathered round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted, also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table. There certainly was a twang. The dairyman, who had thrown himself into abstraction to better realize the taste, and so divine the particular species of noxious weed to which it appertained, suddenly exclaimed\u2014 \u201c\u2019Tis garlic! and I thought there wasn\u2019t a blade left in that mead!\u201d Then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead, into which a few of the cows had been admitted of late, had, in years gone by, spoilt the butter in the same way. The dairyman had not recognized the taste at that time, and thought the butter bewitched. \u201cWe must overhaul that mead,\u201d he resumed; \u201cthis mustn\u2019t continny!\u201d All having armed themselves with old pointed knives, they went out together. As the inimical plant could only be present in very microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before them. However, they formed themselves into line, all assisting, owing to the importance of the search; the dairyman at the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and the married dairywomen\u2014Beck Knibbs, with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps of the water-meads\u2014who lived in their respective cottages.", " As yet the harm done was small. But it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her. He was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse. He thought he would go and see his friends. It might be possible to sound them upon this. In less than five months his term here would have ended, and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he would be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in a position to start on his own account. Would not a farmer want a wife, and should a farmer\u2019s wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a woman who understood farming? Notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the silence, he resolved to go his journey. One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some maid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day. \u201cO no,\u201d said Dairyman Crick. \u201cMr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to spend a few days wi\u2019 his kinsfolk.\u201d For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song. But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on towards the end of his time wi\u2019 me,\u201d added the dairyman, with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal; \u201cand so I suppose he is beginning to see about his plans elsewhere.\u201d \u201cHow much longer is he to bide here?\u201d asked Izz Huett, the only one of the gloom-stricken bevy who could trust her voice with the question."], "Who was Angel involved with before coming to Talbothays?": [" \u201cI wanted to ask you something, and just then you ran away.\u201d \u201cYes, perhaps I am capricious,\u201d she murmured. She suddenly approached him, and put a hand upon each of his arms. \u201cNo, Angel, I am not really so\u2014by nature, I mean!\u201d The more particularly to assure him that she was not, she placed herself close to him in the settle, and allowed her head to find a resting-place against Clare\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat did you want to ask me\u2014I am sure I will answer it,\u201d she continued humbly. \u201cWell, you love me, and have agreed to marry me, and hence there follows a thirdly, \u2018When shall the day be?\u2019\u201d \u201cI like living like this.\u201d \u201cBut I must think of starting in business on my own hook with the new year, or a little later. And before I get involved in the multifarious details of my new position, I should like to have secured my partner.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d she timidly answered, \u201cto talk quite practically, wouldn\u2019t it be best not to marry till after all that?\u2014Though I can\u2019t bear the thought o\u2019 your going away and leaving me here!\u201d \u201cOf course you cannot\u2014and it is not best in this case. I want you to help me in many ways in making my start. When shall it be? Why not a fortnight from now?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said, becoming grave: \u201cI have so many things to think of first.\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201d He drew her gently nearer to him. The reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near. Before discussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the corner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment Mr Dairyman Crick, Mrs Crick, and two of the milkmaids.", " Perhaps he revered his father\u2019s practice even more now than ever, seeing that, in the question of making Tessy his wife, his father had not once thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless. The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel\u2019s getting a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel admired it none the less. Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren. XXVII An up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd miles through a garish mid-day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a mile or two west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or Froom. Immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals, the very bees and butterflies drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads. It was with a sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his student-days; and, much as he loved his parents, he could not help being aware that to come here, as now, after an experience of home-life, affected him like throwing off splints and bandages; even the one customary curb on the humours of English rural societies being absent in this place, Talbothays having no resident landlord.", " \u201cBut what shall I tell the dairyman\u2019s wife?\u201d said Angel. \u201cThe truth, of course,\u201d said his father. \u201cI rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black-puddings very much. She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me directly I return.\u201d \u201cYou cannot, if we did not,\u201d Mr Clare answered lucidly. \u201cAh\u2014no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple.\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d said Cuthbert and Felix both. \u201cOh\u2014\u2019tis an expression they use down at Talbothays,\u201d replied Angel, blushing. He felt that his parents were right in their practice if wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more. XXVI It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his heart. He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of their walking boots. When the service was over they went out of the room with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone. The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale\u2014either in England or in the Colonies. His father then told him that, as he had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel himself unduly slighted.", " \u201cNow, Miss Flirt, before you go down,\u201d he said peremptorily. \u201cIt is a fortnight since I spoke, and this won\u2019t do any longer. You _must_ tell me what you mean, or I shall have to leave this house. My door was ajar just now, and I saw you. For your own safety I must go. You don\u2019t know. Well? Is it to be yes at last?\u201d \u201cI am only just up, Mr Clare, and it is too early to take me to task!\u201d she pouted. \u201cYou need not call me Flirt. \u2019Tis cruel and untrue. Wait till by and by. Please wait till by and by! I will really think seriously about it between now and then. Let me go downstairs!\u201d She looked a little like what he said she was as, holding the candle sideways, she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words. \u201cCall me Angel, then, and not Mr Clare.\u201d \u201cAngel.\u201d \u201cAngel dearest\u2014why not?\u201d \u201c\u2019Twould mean that I agree, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt would only mean that you love me, even if you cannot marry me; and you were so good as to own that long ago.\u201d \u201cVery well, then, \u2018Angel dearest\u2019, if I _must_,\u201d she murmured, looking at her candle, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding her suspense. Clare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise; but somehow, as Tess stood there in her prettily tucked-up milking gown, her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done, he broke his resolve, and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment."], "Why does Tess initially try to stay away from Angel?": [" They rested here a while, and entering the Vale were next driven onward towards her home by a stranger who did not know their relations. At a midway point, when Nuttlebury had been passed, and where there were cross-roads, Clare stopped the conveyance and said to Tess that if she meant to return to her mother\u2019s house it was here that he would leave her. As they could not talk with freedom in the driver\u2019s presence he asked her to accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads; she assented, and directing the man to wait a few minutes they strolled away. \u201cNow, let us understand each other,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThere is no anger between us, though there is that which I cannot endure at present. I will try to bring myself to endure it. I will let you know where I go to as soon as I know myself. And if I can bring myself to bear it\u2014if it is desirable, possible\u2014I will come to you. But until I come to you it will be better that you should not try to come to me.\u201d The severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess; she saw his view of her clearly enough; he could regard her in no other light than that of one who had practised gross deceit upon him. Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this? But she could contest the point with him no further. She simply repeated after him his own words. \u201cUntil you come to me I must not try to come to you?\u201d \u201cJust so.\u201d \u201cMay I write to you?\u201d \u201cO yes\u2014if you are ill, or want anything at all.", " \u201cThe rest, too, have done better than you.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve all practised it before, and I have not. And I thought it made no difference to you as it is task work, and we are only paid for what we do.\u201d \u201cOh, but it does. I want the barn cleared.\u201d \u201cI am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as the others will do.\u201d He looked sullenly at her and went away. Tess felt that she could not have come to a much worse place; but anything was better than gallantry. When two o\u2019clock arrived the professional reed-drawers tossed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks, tied their last sheaves, and went away. Marian and Izz would have done likewise, but on hearing that Tess meant to stay, to make up by longer hours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her. Looking out at the snow, which still fell, Marian exclaimed, \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got it all to ourselves.\u201d And so at last the conversation turned to their old experiences at the dairy; and, of course, the incidents of their affection for Angel Clare. \u201cIzz and Marian,\u201d said Mrs Angel Clare, with a dignity which was extremely touching, seeing how very little of a wife she was: \u201cI can\u2019t join in talk with you now, as I used to do, about Mr Clare; you will see that I cannot; because, although he is gone away from me for the present, he is my husband.\u201d Izz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls who had loved Clare.", " \u201cIt is quite true, all of it; it must be. You must go away from me.\u201d \u201cBut what can you do?\u201d \u201cI can go home.\u201d Clare had not thought of that. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he inquired. \u201cQuite sure. We ought to part, and we may as well get it past and done. You once said that I was apt to win men against their better judgement; and if I am constantly before your eyes I may cause you to change your plans in opposition to your reason and wish; and afterwards your repentance and my sorrow will be terrible.\u201d \u201cAnd you would like to go home?\u201d he asked. \u201cI want to leave you, and go home.\u201d \u201cThen it shall be so.\u201d Though she did not look up at him, she started. There was a difference between the proposition and the covenant, which she had felt only too quickly. \u201cI feared it would come to this,\u201d she murmured, her countenance meekly fixed. \u201cI don\u2019t complain, Angel, I\u2014I think it best. What you said has quite convinced me. Yes, though nobody else should reproach me if we should stay together, yet somewhen, years hence, you might get angry with me for any ordinary matter, and knowing what you do of my bygones, you yourself might be tempted to say words, and they might be overheard, perhaps by my own children. O, what only hurts me now would torture and kill me then! I will go\u2014to-morrow.\u201d \u201cAnd I shall not stay here. Though I didn\u2019t like to initiate it, I have seen that it was advisable we should part\u2014at least for a while, till I can better see the shape that things have taken, and can write to you.\u201d Tess stole a glance at her husband.", " I would flatly refuse, if I were you.\u201d \u201cBut she wants me particularly to do it, and to be ready by to-morrow morning.\u201d \u201cDoes she? Well then\u2014I\u2019ll give you a lesson or two.\u201d \u201cOh no, you won\u2019t!\u201d said Tess, withdrawing towards the door. \u201cNonsense; I don\u2019t want to touch you. See\u2014I\u2019ll stand on this side of the wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so you may feel quite safe. Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly. There \u2019tis\u2014so.\u201d He suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of \u201cTake, O take those lips away.\u201d But the allusion was lost upon Tess. \u201cNow try,\u201d said d\u2019Urberville. She attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural severity. But he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of him, she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note; laughing distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that she had laughed. He encouraged her with \u201cTry again!\u201d Tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she tried\u2014ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound. The momentary pleasure of success got the better of her; her eyes enlarged, and she involuntarily smiled in his face. \u201cThat\u2019s it! Now I have started you\u2014you\u2019ll go on beautifully. There\u2014I said I would not come near you; and, in spite of such temptation as never before fell to mortal man, I\u2019ll keep my word.... Tess, do you think my mother a queer old soul?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know much of her yet, sir.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll find her so; she must be, to make you learn to whistle to her bullfinches."], "Angel breaks the rules by arranging for Tess to have her favorite ___ to work with.": [" I fear I could not conscientiously do so. I love the Church as one loves a parent. I shall always have the warmest affection for her. There is no institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration; but I cannot honestly be ordained her minister, as my brothers are, while she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry.\u201d It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this! He was stultified, shocked, paralysed. And if Angel were not going to enter the Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge? The University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume. He was a man not merely religious, but devout; a firm believer\u2014not as the phrase is now elusively construed by theological thimble-riggers in the Church and out of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school: one who could Indeed opine That the Eternal and Divine Did, eighteen centuries ago In very truth... Angel\u2019s father tried argument, persuasion, entreaty. \u201cNo, father; I cannot underwrite Article Four (leave alone the rest), taking it \u2018in the literal and grammatical sense\u2019 as required by the Declaration; and, therefore, I can\u2019t be a parson in the present state of affairs,\u201d said Angel. \u201cMy whole instinct in matters of religion is towards reconstruction; to quote your favorite Epistle to the Hebrews, \u2018the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.\u2019\u201d His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him.", " Under his linen milking-pinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white shirt. Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what he was. He might with equal probability have been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. That he was but a novice at dairy work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent upon the milking of one cow. Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the newcomer, \u201cHow pretty she is!\u201d with something of real generosity and admiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify the assertion\u2014which, strictly speaking, they might have done, prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in Tess. When the milking was finished for the evening they straggled indoors, where Mrs Crick, the dairyman\u2019s wife\u2014who was too respectable to go out milking herself, and wore a hot stuff gown in warm weather because the dairymaids wore prints\u2014was giving an eye to the leads and things. Only two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house besides herself, most of the helpers going to their homes. She saw nothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on the story, and asked no questions about him, the remainder of the evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bed-chamber. It was a large room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the sleeping-cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same apartment.", " The peeling of the former, and the selection of the latter, had been an operation of personal care. There were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train, their silver-wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and trouble, having almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance in such a jaunty situation. In a true view, perhaps, there was more to be gathered and told of each anxious and experienced one, to whom the years were drawing nigh when she should say, \u201cI have no pleasure in them,\u201d than of her juvenile comrades. But let the elder be passed over here for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm. The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold, and black, and brown. Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful nose, others a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. A difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate self-consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and showed that they were genuine country girls, unaccustomed to many eyes. And as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each had a private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some affection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which, though perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will.", " \u201cThe rest, too, have done better than you.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve all practised it before, and I have not. And I thought it made no difference to you as it is task work, and we are only paid for what we do.\u201d \u201cOh, but it does. I want the barn cleared.\u201d \u201cI am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as the others will do.\u201d He looked sullenly at her and went away. Tess felt that she could not have come to a much worse place; but anything was better than gallantry. When two o\u2019clock arrived the professional reed-drawers tossed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks, tied their last sheaves, and went away. Marian and Izz would have done likewise, but on hearing that Tess meant to stay, to make up by longer hours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her.

The bull softened down, and stood still, looking hard at William Dewy, who fiddled on and on; till a sort of a smile stole over the bull\u2019s face. But no sooner did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of William\u2019s breeches. Well, William had to turn about and play on, willy-nilly; and \u2019twas only three o\u2019clock in the world, and \u2019a knowed that nobody would come that way for hours, and he so leery and tired that \u2019a didn\u2019t know what to do. When he had scraped till about four o\u2019clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon, and he said to himself, \u2018There\u2019s only this last tune between me and eternal welfare! Heaven save me, or I\u2019m a done man.\u2019 Well, then he called to mind how he\u2019d seen the cattle kneel o\u2019 Christmas Eves in the dead o\u2019 night. It was not Christmas Eve then, but it came into his head to play a trick upon the bull. So he broke into the \u2019Tivity Hymm, just as at Christmas carol-singing; when, lo and behold, down went the bull on his bended knees, in his ignorance, just as if \u2019twere the true \u2019Tivity night and hour. As soon as his horned friend were down, William turned, clinked off like a long-dog, and jumped safe over hedge, before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him.", " To neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to mention Tess. His mother made him sandwiches, and his father accompanied him, on his own mare, a little way along the road. Having fairly well advanced his own affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence, as they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his father\u2019s account of his parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved, because of his strict interpretations of the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious Calvinistic doctrine. \u201cPernicious!\u201d said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea. He told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and well-to-do; and he also candidly admitted many failures. As an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young upstart squire named d\u2019Urberville, living some forty miles off, in the neighbourhood of Trantridge. \u201cNot one of the ancient d\u2019Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places?\u201d asked his son. \u201cThat curiously historic worn-out family with its ghostly legend of the coach-and-four?\u201d \u201cO no. The original d\u2019Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty or eighty years ago\u2014at least, I believe so. This seems to be a new family which had taken the name; for the credit of the former knightly line I hope they are spurious, I\u2019m sure.", " \u201cTess, why did you say \u2018no\u2019 in such a positive way?\u201d he asked her in the course of a few days. She started. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I told you why\u2014partly. I am not good enough\u2014not worthy enough.\u201d \u201cHow? Not fine lady enough?\u201d \u201cYes\u2014something like that,\u201d murmured she. \u201cYour friends would scorn me.\u201d \u201cIndeed, you mistake them\u2014my father and mother. As for my brothers, I don\u2019t care\u2014\u201d He clasped his fingers behind her back to keep her from slipping away. \u201cNow\u2014you did not mean it, sweet?\u2014I am sure you did not! You have made me so restless that I cannot read, or play, or do anything. I am in no hurry, Tess, but I want to know\u2014to hear from your own warm lips\u2014that you will some day be mine\u2014any time you may choose; but some day?\u201d She could only shake her head and look away from him. Clare regarded her attentively, conned the characters of her face as if they had been hieroglyphics. The denial seemed real. \u201cThen I ought not to hold you in this way\u2014ought I? I have no right to you\u2014no right to seek out where you are, or walk with you! Honestly, Tess, do you love any other man?\u201d \u201cHow can you ask?\u201d she said, with continued self-suppression. \u201cI almost know that you do not. But then, why do you repulse me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t repulse you. I like you to\u2014tell me you love me; and you may always tell me so as you go about with me\u2014and never offend me.\u201d \u201cBut you will not accept me as a husband?\u201d \u201cAh\u2014that\u2019s different\u2014it is for your good, indeed, my dearest!", " Her misgiving was such that at dusk, when the milking was over, she walked in the garden alone, to continue her regrets that she had disclosed to him her discovery of his considerateness. It was a typical summer evening in June, the atmosphere being in such delicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects seemed endowed with two or three senses, if not five. There was no distinction between the near and the far, and an auditor felt close to everything within the horizon. The soundlessness impressed her as a positive entity rather than as the mere negation of noise. It was broken by the strumming of strings. Tess had heard those notes in the attic above her head. Dim, flattened, constrained by their confinement, they had never appealed to her as now, when they wandered in the still air with a stark quality like that of nudity. To speak absolutely, both instrument and execution were poor; but the relative is all, and as she listened Tess, like a fascinated bird, could not leave the spot. Far from leaving she drew up towards the performer, keeping behind the hedge that he might not guess her presence. The outskirt of the garden in which Tess found herself had been left uncultivated for some years, and was now damp and rank with juicy grass which sent up mists of pollen at a touch; and with tall blooming weeds emitting offensive smells\u2014weeds whose red and yellow and purple hues formed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated flowers."], "What is interpreted as a sign that two people on the farm are in love?": [" The labourers\u2014or \u201cwork-folk\u201d, as they used to call themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from without\u2014who wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to the new farms. These annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here. When Tess\u2019s mother was a child the majority of the field-folk about Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latterly the desire for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch. With the younger families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage. The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it from a distance, till by residence there it became in turn their Egypt also; and so they changed and changed. However, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. A depopulation was also going on. The village had formerly contained, side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and better-informed class, ranking distinctly above the former\u2014the class to which Tess\u2019s father and mother had belonged\u2014and including the carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with nondescript workers other than farm-labourers; a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess\u2019s father, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders.", " Tess\u2019s eyes, fixed on distance, began to fill. \u201cWhy do you cry, my darling?\u201d he said. \u201cO\u2014I don\u2019t know!\u201d she murmured. As she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became agitated and tried to withdraw. \u201cWell, I have betrayed my feeling, Tess, at last,\u201d said he, with a curious sigh of desperation, signifying unconsciously that his heart had outrun his judgement. \u201cThat I\u2014love you dearly and truly I need not say. But I\u2014it shall go no further now\u2014it distresses you\u2014I am as surprised as you are. You will not think I have presumed upon your defencelessness\u2014been too quick and unreflecting, will you?\u201d \u201cN\u2019\u2014I can\u2019t tell.\u201d He had allowed her to free herself; and in a minute or two the milking of each was resumed. Nobody had beheld the gravitation of the two into one; and when the dairyman came round by that screened nook a few minutes later, there was not a sign to reveal that the markedly sundered pair were more to each other than mere acquaintance. Yet in the interval since Crick\u2019s last view of them something had occurred which changed the pivot of the universe for their two natures; something which, had he known its quality, the dairyman would have despised, as a practical man; yet which was based upon a more stubborn and resistless tendency than a whole heap of so-called practicalities. A veil had been whisked aside; the tract of each one\u2019s outlook was to have a new horizon thenceforward\u2014for a short time or for a long.", " The kindly dimness of the weak candle abstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which sunlight might have revealed\u2014the stubble scratches upon her wrists, and the weariness of her eyes\u2014her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring effect upon the face which had been her undoing, showing it as a thing of immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity which was almost regal. The little ones kneeling round, their sleepy eyes blinking and red, awaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their physical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active. The most impressed of them said: \u201cBe you really going to christen him, Tess?\u201d The girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name going to be?\u201d She had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the book of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal service, and now she pronounced it: \u201cSORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d She sprinkled the water, and there was silence. \u201cSay \u2018Amen,\u2019 children.\u201d The tiny voices piped in obedient response, \u201cAmen!\u201d Tess went on: \u201cWe receive this child\u201d\u2014and so forth\u2014\u201cand do sign him with the sign of the Cross.\u201d Here she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense cross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary sentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the devil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life\u2019s end.", " She also, by a felicitous thought, took a handkerchief from her bundle and tied it round her face under her bonnet, covering her chin and half her cheeks and temples, as if she were suffering from toothache. Then with her little scissors, by the aid of a pocket looking-glass, she mercilessly nipped her eyebrows off, and thus insured against aggressive admiration, she went on her uneven way. \u201cWhat a mommet of a maid!\u201d said the next man who met her to a companion. Tears came into her eyes for very pity of herself as she heard him. \u201cBut I don\u2019t care!\u201d she said. \u201cO no\u2014I don\u2019t care! I\u2019ll always be ugly now, because Angel is not here, and I have nobody to take care of me. My husband that was is gone away, and never will love me any more; but I love him just the same, and hate all other men, and like to make \u2019em think scornfully of me!\u201d Thus Tess walks on; a figure which is part of the landscape; a fieldwoman pure and simple, in winter guise; a gray serge cape, a red woollen cravat, a stuff skirt covered by a whitey-brown rough wrapper, and buff-leather gloves. Every thread of that old attire has become faded and thin under the stroke of raindrops, the burn of sunbeams, and the stress of winds. There is no sign of young passion in her now\u2014 The maiden\u2019s mouth is cold . . . . . Fold over simple fold Binding her head. Inside this exterior, over which the eye might have roved as over a thing scarcely percipient, almost inorganic, there was the record of a pulsing life which had learnt too well, for its years, of the dust and ashes of things, of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love."], "What plant causes the cow\u2019s milk to have an unpleasant \u201ctwang?\u2019": [" Dairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house. He had received a letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter had a twang. \u201cAnd begad, so \u2019t have!\u201d said the dairyman, who held in his left hand a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. \u201cYes\u2014taste for yourself!\u201d Several of them gathered round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted, also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table. There certainly was a twang. The dairyman, who had thrown himself into abstraction to better realize the taste, and so divine the particular species of noxious weed to which it appertained, suddenly exclaimed\u2014 \u201c\u2019Tis garlic! and I thought there wasn\u2019t a blade left in that mead!\u201d Then all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead, into which a few of the cows had been admitted of late, had, in years gone by, spoilt the butter in the same way. The dairyman had not recognized the taste at that time, and thought the butter bewitched. \u201cWe must overhaul that mead,\u201d he resumed; \u201cthis mustn\u2019t continny!\u201d All having armed themselves with old pointed knives, they went out together. As the inimical plant could only be present in very microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before them. However, they formed themselves into line, all assisting, owing to the importance of the search; the dairyman at the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and the married dairywomen\u2014Beck Knibbs, with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps of the water-meads\u2014who lived in their respective cottages.", " But, Lord, I took no notice of the old woman\u2019s ramblings, not I.\u201d \u201cOh no\u2014it is nothing,\u201d said Tess. Then the talk was of business only. \u201cYou can milk \u2019em clean, my maidy? I don\u2019t want my cows going azew at this time o\u2019 year.\u201d She reassured him on that point, and he surveyed her up and down. She had been staying indoors a good deal, and her complexion had grown delicate. \u201cQuite sure you can stand it? \u2019Tis comfortable enough here for rough folk; but we don\u2019t live in a cowcumber frame.\u201d She declared that she could stand it, and her zest and willingness seemed to win him over. \u201cWell, I suppose you\u2019ll want a dish o\u2019 tay, or victuals of some sort, hey? Not yet? Well, do as ye like about it. But faith, if \u2019twas I, I should be as dry as a kex wi\u2019 travelling so far.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll begin milking now, to get my hand in,\u201d said Tess. She drank a little milk as temporary refreshment\u2014to the surprise\u2014indeed, slight contempt\u2014of Dairyman Crick, to whose mind it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage. \u201cOh, if ye can swaller that, be it so,\u201d he said indifferently, while holding up the pail that she sipped from. \u201c\u2019Tis what I hain\u2019t touched for years\u2014not I. Rot the stuff; it would lie in my innerds like lead. You can try your hand upon she,\u201d he pursued, nodding to the nearest cow. \u201cNot but what she do milk rather hard. We\u2019ve hard ones and we\u2019ve easy ones, like other folks. However, you\u2019ll find out that soon enough.\u201d When Tess had changed her bonnet for a hood, and was really on her stool under the cow, and the milk was squirting from her fists into the pail, she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future.", " \u201cI\u2019ve got to go a-skimming,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cand I have on\u2019y old Deb to help me to-day. Mrs Crick is gone to market with Mr Crick, and Retty is not well, and the others are gone out somewhere, and won\u2019t be home till milking.\u201d As they retreated to the milk-house Deborah Fyander appeared on the stairs. \u201cI have come back, Deborah,\u201d said Mr Clare, upwards. \u201cSo I can help Tess with the skimming; and, as you are very tired, I am sure, you needn\u2019t come down till milking-time.\u201d Possibly the Talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that afternoon. Tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared as having light and shade and position, but no particular outline. Every time she held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the work her hand trembled, the ardour of his affection being so palpable that she seemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun. Then he pressed her again to his side, and when she had done running her forefinger round the leads to cut off the cream-edge, he cleaned it in nature\u2019s way; for the unconstrained manners of Talbothays dairy came convenient now. \u201cI may as well say it now as later, dearest,\u201d he resumed gently. \u201cI wish to ask you something of a very practical nature, which I have been thinking of ever since that day last week in the meads. I shall soon want to marry, and, being a farmer, you see I shall require for my wife a woman who knows all about the management of farms.", " When she rose from her stool under a finished cow, Angel Clare, who had been observing her for some time, asked her if she would take the aforesaid creatures next. She silently assented, and with her stool at arm\u2019s length, and the pail against her knee, went round to where they stood. Soon the sound of Old Pretty\u2019s milk fizzing into the pail came through the hedge, and then Angel felt inclined to go round the corner also, to finish off a hard-yielding milcher who had strayed there, he being now as capable of this as the dairyman himself. All the men, and some of the women, when milking, dug their foreheads into the cows and gazed into the pail. But a few\u2014mainly the younger ones\u2014rested their heads sideways. This was Tess Durbeyfield\u2019s habit, her temple pressing the milcher\u2019s flank, her eyes fixed on the far end of the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation. She was milking Old Pretty thus, and the sun chancing to be on the milking-side, it shone flat upon her pink-gowned form and her white curtain-bonnet, and upon her profile, rendering it keen as a cameo cut from the dun background of the cow. She did not know that Clare had followed her round, and that he sat under his cow watching her. The stillness of her head and features was remarkable: she might have been in a trance, her eyes open, yet unseeing. Nothing in the picture moved but Old Pretty\u2019s tail and Tess\u2019s pink hands, the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation only, as if they were obeying a reflex stimulus, like a beating heart."], "When Angel offers to carry the girls across the flooded road, what does he do to suggest that Tess is his favorite?": [" I fear I could not conscientiously do so. I love the Church as one loves a parent. I shall always have the warmest affection for her. There is no institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration; but I cannot honestly be ordained her minister, as my brothers are, while she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry.\u201d It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this! He was stultified, shocked, paralysed. And if Angel were not going to enter the Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge? The University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume. He was a man not merely religious, but devout; a firm believer\u2014not as the phrase is now elusively construed by theological thimble-riggers in the Church and out of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school: one who could Indeed opine That the Eternal and Divine Did, eighteen centuries ago In very truth... Angel\u2019s father tried argument, persuasion, entreaty. \u201cNo, father; I cannot underwrite Article Four (leave alone the rest), taking it \u2018in the literal and grammatical sense\u2019 as required by the Declaration; and, therefore, I can\u2019t be a parson in the present state of affairs,\u201d said Angel. \u201cMy whole instinct in matters of religion is towards reconstruction; to quote your favorite Epistle to the Hebrews, \u2018the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.\u2019\u201d His father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him.", " Beyond this there was nothing in the manner of their leaving to suggest a _fiasco_, or that they were not going together to visit friends. Their route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such solemn joy in each other a few days back, and as Clare wished to wind up his business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs Crick a call at the same time, unless she would excite suspicion of their unhappy state. To make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage by the wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy-house, and descended the track on foot, side by side. The withy-bed had been cut, and they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had followed her when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the enclosure in which she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away behind the cow-stalls the mead which had been the scene of their first embrace. The gold of the summer picture was now gray, the colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold. Over the barton-gate the dairyman saw them, and came forward, throwing into his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate in Talbothays and its vicinity on the re-appearance of the newly-married. Then Mrs Crick emerged from the house, and several others of their old acquaintance, though Marian and Retty did not seem to be there. Tess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours, which affected her far otherwise than they supposed.", " I\u2019d carry you all four together. Now, Marian, attend,\u201d he continued, \u201cand put your arms round my shoulders, so. Now! Hold on. That\u2019s well done.\u201d Marian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed, and Angel strode off with her, his slim figure, as viewed from behind, looking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers. They disappeared round the curve of the road, and only his sousing footsteps and the top ribbon of Marian\u2019s bonnet told where they were. In a few minutes he reappeared. Izz Huett was the next in order upon the bank. \u201cHere he comes,\u201d she murmured, and they could hear that her lips were dry with emotion. \u201cAnd I have to put my arms round his neck and look into his face as Marian did.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in that,\u201d said Tess quickly. \u201cThere\u2019s a time for everything,\u201d continued Izz, unheeding. \u201cA time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now going to be mine.\u201d \u201cFie\u2014it is Scripture, Izz!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Izz, \u201cI\u2019ve always a\u2019 ear at church for pretty verses.\u201d Angel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a commonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz. She quietly and dreamily lowered herself into his arms, and Angel methodically marched off with her. When he was heard returning for the third time Retty\u2019s throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her. He went up to the red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at Tess.", " The wall seemed to be the only friend she had. She had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night. Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage\u2014gathered together after their day\u2019s labour\u2014talking to each other within, and the rattle of their supper-plates was also audible. But in the village-street she had seen no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the approach of one feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold, wore the print gown and the tilt-bonnet of summer time. Tess instinctively thought it might be Marian, and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in the gloom, surely enough it was she. Marian was even stouter and redder in the face than formerly, and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any previous period of her existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive, and she responded readily to Marian\u2019s greeting. Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved by the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition than at first; though she had dimly heard of the separation. \u201cTess\u2014Mrs Clare\u2014the dear wife of dear he! And is it really so bad as this, my child? Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way? Anybody been beating \u2019ee? Not _he_?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no! I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled, Marian.\u201d She pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild thoughts."], "How do Marian, Izz, and Retty feel about Angel?": [" \u201cHis thoughts be of other cheeks than thine!\u201d Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again. \u201cThere he is again!\u201d cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp hair and keenly cut lips. \u201cYou needn\u2019t say anything, Izz,\u201d answered Retty. \u201cFor I zid you kissing his shade.\u201d _\u201dWhat_ did you see her doing?\u201d asked Marian. \u201cWhy\u2014he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was standing there filling a vat. She put her mouth against the wall and kissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cO Izz Huett!\u201d said Marian. A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett\u2019s cheek. \u201cWell, there was no harm in it,\u201d she declared, with attempted coolness. \u201cAnd if I be in love wi\u2019en, so is Retty, too; and so be you, Marian, come to that.\u201d Marian\u2019s full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness. \u201cI!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat a tale! Ah, there he is again! Dear eyes\u2014dear face\u2014dear Mr Clare!\u201d \u201cThere\u2014you\u2019ve owned it!\u201d \u201cSo have you\u2014so have we all,\u201d said Marian, with the dry frankness of complete indifference to opinion. \u201cIt is silly to pretend otherwise amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would just marry \u2019n to-morrow!\u201d \u201cSo would I\u2014and more,\u201d murmured Izz Huett. \u201cAnd I too,\u201d whispered the more timid Retty. The listener grew warm. \u201cWe can\u2019t all marry him,\u201d said Izz. \u201cWe shan\u2019t, either of us; which is worse still,\u201d said the eldest.", " I\u2019d carry you all four together.

When he was heard returning for the third time Retty\u2019s throbbing heart could be almost seen to shake her. He went up to the red-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at Tess.", " A light was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed, awaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts. But she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood. They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to have. Their condition was objective, contemplative. \u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her!\u201d murmured Retty, never taking eyes off Tess. \u201cHow her face do show it!\u201d \u201cYou _be_ going to marry him?\u201d asked Marian. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess. \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cSome day.\u201d They thought that this was evasiveness only. \u201c_Yes_\u2014going to _marry_ him\u2014a gentleman!\u201d repeated Izz Huett. And by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another, crept out of their beds, and came and stood barefooted round Tess. Retty put her hands upon Tess\u2019s shoulders, as if to realize her friend\u2019s corporeality after such a miracle, and the other two laid their arms round her waist, all looking into her face. \u201cHow it do seem! Almost more than I can think of!\u201d said Izz Huett. Marian kissed Tess. \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured as she withdrew her lips. \u201cWas that because of love for her, or because other lips have touched there by now?\u201d continued Izz drily to Marian. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking o\u2019 that,\u201d said Marian simply. \u201cI was on\u2019y feeling all the strangeness o\u2019t\u2014that she is to be his wife, and nobody else. I don\u2019t say nay to it, nor either of us, because we did not think of it\u2014only loved him. Still, nobody else is to marry\u2019n in the world\u2014no fine lady, nobody in silks and satins; but she who do live like we.\u201d \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t dislike me for it?\u201d said Tess in a low voice.", " \u201cThere he is again!\u201d They all three blew him a silent kiss. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Retty quickly. \u201cBecause he likes Tess Durbeyfield best,\u201d said Marian, lowering her voice. \u201cI have watched him every day, and have found it out.\u201d There was a reflective silence. \u201cBut she don\u2019t care anything for \u2019n?\u201d at length breathed Retty. \u201cWell\u2014I sometimes think that too.\u201d \u201cBut how silly all this is!\u201d said Izz Huett impatiently. \u201cOf course he won\u2019t marry any one of us, or Tess either\u2014a gentleman\u2019s son, who\u2019s going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! More likely to ask us to come wi\u2019en as farm-hands at so much a year!\u201d One sighed, and another sighed, and Marian\u2019s plump figure sighed biggest of all. Somebody in bed hard by sighed too. Tears came into the eyes of Retty Priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest\u2014the last bud of the Paridelles, so important in the county annals. They watched silently a little longer, their three faces still close together as before, and the triple hues of their hair mingling. But the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and they saw him no more; and, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into their beds. In a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own room. Marian was soon snoring, but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time. Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep. The deeper-passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then. This conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to swallow that day."], "What is Tess doing the first time Angel embraces her and tells her he loves her?": [" Tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her brothers-in-law brought them so nearly behind her back that she could hear every word of their conversation. They said nothing, however, which particularly interested her till, observing the young lady still further in front, one of them remarked, \u201cThere is Mercy Chant. Let us overtake her.\u201d Tess knew the name. It was the woman who had been destined for Angel\u2019s life-companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably would have married but for her intrusive self. She would have known as much without previous information if she had waited a moment, for one of the brothers proceeded to say: \u201cAh! poor Angel, poor Angel! I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever she may be. It is a queer business, apparently. Whether she has joined him yet or not I don\u2019t know; but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from him.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say. He never tells me anything nowadays. His ill-considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions.\u201d Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but she could not outwalk them without exciting notice. At last they outsped her altogether, and passed her by. The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned. Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands, and the three went on together.", " I fear I could not conscientiously do so. I love the Church as one loves a parent. I shall always have the warmest affection for her. There is no institution for whose history I have a deeper admiration; but I cannot honestly be ordained her minister, as my brothers are, while she refuses to liberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry.\u201d It had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar that one of his own flesh and blood could come to this! He was stultified, shocked, paralysed. And if Angel were not going to enter the Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge? The University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume. He was a man not merely religious, but devout; a firm believer\u2014not as the phrase is now elusively construed by theological thimble-riggers in the Church and out of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school: one who could Indeed opine That the Eternal and Divine Did, eighteen centuries ago In very truth...

It was under this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown upon his life had stretched its gloom over him. Yet when he had unlocked the door of the sitting-room and looked into it, the memory which returned first upon him was that of their happy arrival on a similar afternoon, the first fresh sense of sharing a habitation conjointly, the first meal together, the chatting by the fire with joined hands. The farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit, and Clare was in the rooms alone for some time. Inwardly swollen with a renewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with, he went upstairs to her chamber, which had never been his. The bed was smooth as she had made it with her own hands on the morning of leaving. The mistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed it. Having been there three or four weeks it was turning colour, and the leaves and berries were wrinkled. Angel took it down and crushed it into the grate. Standing there, he for the first time doubted whether his course in this conjecture had been a wise, much less a generous, one.", " They stood still, whereupon little furred and feathered heads popped up from the smooth surface of the water; but, finding that the disturbing presences had paused, and not passed by, they disappeared again. Upon this river-brink they lingered till the fog began to close round them\u2014which was very early in the evening at this time of the year\u2014settling on the lashes of her eyes, where it rested like crystals, and on his brows and hair. They walked later on Sundays, when it was quite dark. Some of the dairy-people, who were also out of doors on the first Sunday evening after their engagement, heard her impulsive speeches, ecstasized to fragments, though they were too far off to hear the words discoursed; noted the spasmodic catch in her remarks, broken into syllables by the leapings of her heart, as she walked leaning on his arm; her contented pauses, the occasional little laugh upon which her soul seemed to ride\u2014the laugh of a woman in company with the man she loves and has won from all other women\u2014unlike anything else in nature. They marked the buoyancy of her tread, like the skim of a bird which has not quite alighted. Her affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess\u2019s being; it enveloped her as a photosphere, irradiated her into forgetfulness of her past sorrows, keeping back the gloomy spectres that would persist in their attempts to touch her\u2014doubt, fear, moodiness, care, shame."], "What change do Angel\u2019s family notice after Angel spends time with common farm folk?": [" The labourers\u2014or \u201cwork-folk\u201d, as they used to call themselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from without\u2014who wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to the new farms. These annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here. When Tess\u2019s mother was a child the majority of the field-folk about Marlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the home also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latterly the desire for yearly removal had risen to a high pitch. With the younger families it was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage. The Egypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it from a distance, till by residence there it became in turn their Egypt also; and so they changed and changed. However, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life did not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. A depopulation was also going on. The village had formerly contained, side by side with the argicultural labourers, an interesting and better-informed class, ranking distinctly above the former\u2014the class to which Tess\u2019s father and mother had belonged\u2014and including the carpenter, the smith, the shoemaker, the huckster, together with nondescript workers other than farm-labourers; a set of people who owed a certain stability of aim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess\u2019s father, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders.", " \u201cIs she of a family such as you would care to marry into\u2014a lady, in short?\u201d asked his startled mother, who had come softly into the study during the conversation. \u201cShe is not what in common parlance is called a lady,\u201d said Angel, unflinchingly, \u201cfor she is a cottager\u2019s daughter, as I am proud to say. But she _is_ a lady, nevertheless\u2014in feeling and nature.\u201d \u201cMercy Chant is of a very good family.\u201d \u201cPooh!\u2014what\u2019s the advantage of that, mother?\u201d said Angel quickly. \u201cHow is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I have, and shall have to do?\u201d \u201cMercy is accomplished. And accomplishments have their charm,\u201d returned his mother, looking at him through her silver spectacles. \u201cAs to external accomplishments, what will be the use of them in the life I am going to lead?\u2014while as to her reading, I can take that in hand. She\u2019ll be apt pupil enough, as you would say if you knew her. She\u2019s brim full of poetry\u2014actualized poetry, if I may use the expression. She _lives_ what paper-poets only write... And she is an unimpeachable Christian, I am sure; perhaps of the very tribe, genus, and species you desire to propagate.\u201d \u201cO Angel, you are mocking!\u201d \u201cMother, I beg pardon. But as she really does attend Church almost every Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality, and feel that I may do worse than choose her.\u201d Angel waxed quite earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which (never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead) he had been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other milkmaids, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially naturalistic.", " At first he lived up above entirely, reading a good deal, and strumming upon an old harp which he had bought at a sale, saying when in a bitter humour that he might have to get his living by it in the streets some day. But he soon preferred to read human nature by taking his meals downstairs in the general dining-kitchen, with the dairyman and his wife, and the maids and men, who all together formed a lively assembly; for though but few milking hands slept in the house, several joined the family at meals. The longer Clare resided here the less objection had he to his company, and the more did he like to share quarters with them in common. Much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their companionship. The conventional farm-folk of his imagination\u2014personified in the newspaper-press by the pitiable dummy known as Hodge\u2014were obliterated after a few days\u2019 residence. At close quarters no Hodge was to be seen. At first, it is true, when Clare\u2019s intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society, these friends with whom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange. Sitting down as a level member of the dairyman\u2019s household seemed at the outset an undignified proceeding. The ideas, the modes, the surroundings, appeared retrogressive and unmeaning. But with living on there, day after day, the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect in the spectacle. Without any objective change whatever, variety had taken the place of monotonousness.", " But no, no!\u201d she cried. \u201cI will take nothing from you, either for them or for me!\u201d He did not accompany her further, since, as she lived with the household, all was public indoors. No sooner had she herself entered, laved herself in a washing-tub, and shared supper with the family than she fell into thought, and withdrawing to the table under the wall, by the light of her own little lamp wrote in a passionate mood\u2014 My own Husband, Let me call you so\u2014I must\u2014even if it makes you angry to think of such an unworthy wife as I. I must cry to you in my trouble\u2014I have no one else! I am so exposed to temptation, Angel. I fear to say who it is, and I do not like to write about it at all. But I cling to you in a way you cannot think! Can you not come to me now, at once, before anything terrible happens? O, I know you cannot, because you are so far away! I think I must die if you do not come soon, or tell me to come to you. The punishment you have measured out to me is deserved\u2014I do know that\u2014well deserved\u2014and you are right and just to be angry with me. But, Angel, please, please, not to be just\u2014only a little kind to me, even if I do not deserve it, and come to me! If you would come, I could die in your arms! I would be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me! Angel, I live entirely for you. I love you too much to blame you for going away, and I know it was necessary you should find a farm."], "Who do the Clares want Angel to marry?": [" Will you be that woman, Tessy?\u201d He put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove. She turned quite careworn. She had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon. With pain that was like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman. \u201cO Mr Clare\u2014I cannot be your wife\u2014I cannot be!\u201d The sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess\u2019s very heart, and she bowed her face in her grief. \u201cBut, Tess!\u201d he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more greedily close. \u201cDo you say no? Surely you love me?\u201d \u201cO yes, yes!

On matrimony he had never once said a word. And what if he had? How a convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to answer him she could not say. But her poor foolish mother little knew her present feeling towards this man. Perhaps it was unusual in the circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and this, as she had said, was what made her detest herself. She had never wholly cared for him; she did not at all care for him now. She had dreaded him, winced before him, succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her helplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent manners, had been stirred to confused surrender awhile: had suddenly despised and disliked him, and had run away.

I won\u2019t mention it again.\u201d She ceased, and he fell into thought. In the far north-east sky he could see between the pillars a level streak of light.

Come to me\u2014come to me, and save me from what threatens me!\u2014 Your faithful heartbroken Tess XLIX The appeal duly found its way to the breakfast-table of the quiet Vicarage to the westward, in that valley where the air is so soft and the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb-Ash, and where to Tess the human world seemed so different (though it was much the same). It was purely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her communications through his father, whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart. \u201cNow,\u201d said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope, \u201cif Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his plans; for I believe it to be from his wife.\u201d He breathed deeply at the thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to Angel. \u201cDear fellow, I hope he will get home safely,\u201d murmured Mrs Clare. \u201cTo my dying day I shall feel that he has been ill-used. You should have sent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given him the same chance as the other boys had. He would have grown out of it under proper influence, and perhaps would have taken Orders after all.", " II The village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape-painter, though within a four hours\u2019 journey from London. It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround it\u2014except perhaps during the droughts of summer. An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry ways. This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass.", " Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of his old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree, though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an academical training. Some two or three years before Angel\u2019s appearance at the Marlott dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller\u2019s, directed to the Reverend James Clare. The Vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm. \u201cWhy has this been sent to my house?\u201d he asked peremptorily, holding up the volume. \u201cIt was ordered, sir.\u201d \u201cNot by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.\u201d The shopkeeper looked into his order-book. \u201cOh, it has been misdirected, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was ordered by Mr Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.\u201d Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck. He went home pale and dejected, and called Angel into his study. \u201cLook into this book, my boy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d \u201cI ordered it,\u201d said Angel simply. \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cTo read.\u201d \u201cHow can you think of reading it?\u201d \u201cHow can I? Why\u2014it is a system of philosophy. There is no more moral, or even religious, work published.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014moral enough; I don\u2019t deny that. But religious!\u2014and for _you_, who intend to be a minister of the Gospel!\u201d \u201cSince you have alluded to the matter, father,\u201d said the son, with anxious thought upon his face, \u201cI should like to say, once for all, that I should prefer not to take Orders.", " \u201cNow, Miss Flirt, before you go down,\u201d he said peremptorily. \u201cIt is a fortnight since I spoke, and this won\u2019t do any longer. You _must_ tell me what you mean, or I shall have to leave this house. My door was ajar just now, and I saw you. For your own safety I must go. You don\u2019t know. Well? Is it to be yes at last?\u201d \u201cI am only just up, Mr Clare, and it is too early to take me to task!\u201d she pouted. \u201cYou need not call me Flirt. \u2019Tis cruel and untrue. Wait till by and by. Please wait till by and by! I will really think seriously about it between now and then.

Clare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise; but somehow, as Tess stood there in her prettily tucked-up milking gown, her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be leisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done, he broke his resolve, and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment."], "What does Angel think is Tess\u2019s reason for refusing to marry him?": [" Will you be that woman, Tessy?\u201d He put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove.

But she wrote anew to her mother, ostensibly to notify the wedding-day; really to again implore her advice.

Gnats, knowing nothing of their brief glorification, wandered across the shimmer of this pathway, irradiated as if they bore fire within them, then passed out of its line, and were quite extinct. In the presence of these things he would remind her that the date was still the question. Or he would ask her at night, when he accompanied her on some mission invented by Mrs Crick to give him the opportunity. This was mostly a journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale, to inquire how the advanced cows were getting on in the straw-barton to which they were relegated. For it was a time of the year that brought great changes to the world of kine. Batches of the animals were sent away daily to this lying-in hospital, where they lived on straw till their calves were born, after which event, and as soon as the calf could walk, mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy.", " Tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours, without the sense of a will. The word had been given; the number of the day written down. Her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to field-folk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellow-creatures; and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested, characteristic of the frame of mind. But she wrote anew to her mother, ostensibly to notify the wedding-day; really to again implore her advice. It was a gentleman who had chosen her, which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered. A post-nuptial explanation, which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man, might not be received with the same feeling by him. But this communication brought no reply from Mrs Durbeyfield. Despite Angel Clare\u2019s plausible representation to himself and to Tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a later date. He loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him. He had entertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes.", " However, Sir John, as we call \u2019n now, kept up the wedding-day as well as he could, and stood treat to everybody in the parish; and John\u2019s wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings. She asked the turnpike-keeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a while, and, on his offering no objection, she dismissed her carriage, and went on to the village alone by a back lane. At sight of her father\u2019s chimney she asked herself how she could possibly enter the house? Inside that cottage her relations were calmly supposing her far away on a wedding-tour with a comparatively rich man, who was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity; while here she was, friendless, creeping up to the old door quite by herself, with no better place to go to in the world. She did not reach the house unobserved. Just by the garden-hedge she was met by a girl who knew her\u2014one of the two or three with whom she had been intimate at school. After making a few inquiries as to how Tess came there, her friend, unheeding her tragic look, interrupted with\u2014 \u201cBut where\u2019s thy gentleman, Tess?\u201d Tess hastily explained that he had been called away on business, and, leaving her interlocutor, clambered over the garden-hedge, and thus made her way to the house.

You should get your harp, sir; not but what a fiddle is best.\u201d Tess, who had given ear to this, thought the words were addressed to the dairyman, but she was wrong. A reply, in the shape of \u201cWhy?\u201d came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls; it had been spoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she had not hitherto perceived. \u201cOh yes; there\u2019s nothing like a fiddle,\u201d said the dairyman. \u201cThough I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows\u2014at least that\u2019s my experience.

Well, this man was a coming home along from a wedding, where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight night, and for shortness\u2019 sake he took a cut across Forty-acres, a field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass. The bull seed William, and took after him, horns aground, begad; and though William runned his best, and hadn\u2019t _much_ drink in him (considering \u2019twas a wedding, and the folks well off), he found he\u2019d never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself."], "What does Angel do when a man from Alec d\u2019Urberville\u2019s village says that Tess is not a virgin?": [" \u2018The villain\u2014where is he?\u2019 says she. \u2018I\u2019ll claw his face for\u2019n, let me only catch him!\u2019 Well, she hunted about everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying a\u2019most stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid\u2014or young woman rather\u2014standing at the door crying her eyes out. I shall never forget it, never! \u2019Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn\u2019t find him nowhere at all.\u201d The dairyman paused, and one or two words of comment came from the listeners. Dairyman Crick\u2019s stories often seemed to be ended when they were not really so, and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of finality; though old friends knew better. The narrator went on\u2014 \u201cWell, how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could never tell, but she found out that he was inside that there churn. Without saying a word she took hold of the winch (it was turned by handpower then), and round she swung him, and Jack began to flop about inside. \u2018O Lard! stop the churn! let me out!\u2019 says he, popping out his head. \u2018I shall be churned into a pummy!\u2019 (He was a cowardly chap in his heart, as such men mostly be). \u2018Not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence!\u2019 says the old woman. \u2018Stop the churn you old witch!\u2019 screams he. \u2018You call me old witch, do ye, you deceiver!\u2019 says she, \u2018when ye ought to ha\u2019 been calling me mother-law these last five months!\u2019 And on went the churn, and Jack\u2019s bones rattled round again.", " Having signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do at present than to get a lodging, and she found one in the house at whose gable-wall she had warmed herself. It was a poor subsistence that she had ensured, but it would afford a shelter for the winter at any rate. That night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address, in case a letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband. But she did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation: it might have brought reproach upon him. XLIII There was no exaggeration in Marian\u2019s definition of Flintcomb-Ash farm as a starve-acre place. The single fat thing on the soil was Marian herself; and she was an importation. Of the three classes of village, the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other words, the village of a resident squire\u2019s tenantry, the village of free or copy-holders, and the absentee-owner\u2019s village, farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third. But Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel Clare; and it sustained her. The swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets\u2014the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes.", " In Saint Charles\u2019s days we was made Knights o\u2019 the Royal Oak, our real name being d\u2019Urberville!... Don\u2019t that make your bosom plim? \u2019Twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee; not because he\u2019d been drinking, as people supposed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad of that. Will it do us any good, mother?\u201d \u201cO yes! \u2019Tis thoughted that great things may come o\u2019t. No doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as \u2019tis known. Your father learnt it on his way hwome from Shaston, and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter.\u201d \u201cWhere is father now?\u201d asked Tess suddenly. Her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: \u201cHe called to see the doctor to-day in Shaston. It is not consumption at all, it seems. It is fat round his heart, \u2019a says. There, it is like this.\u201d Joan Durbeyfield, as she spoke, curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter C, and used the other forefinger as a pointer. \u201c\u2018At the present moment,\u2019 he says to your father, \u2018your heart is enclosed all round there, and all round there; this space is still open,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018As soon as it do meet, so,\u2019\u201d\u2014Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete\u2014\u201c\u2018off you will go like a shadder, Mr Durbeyfield,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.\u2019\u201d Tess looked alarmed.

O, Tess, what\u2019s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!\u201d Accompanied by \u2019Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. \u201cAh\u2014I\u2019m looking for you!\u201d he said, riding up to them. \u201cThis is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!\u201d It was Alec d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhere is Tess?\u201d he asked. Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the direction of the church, and went on, d\u2019Urberville saying that he would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone, d\u2019Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot. In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead, remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall. The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first time in her life. Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff."], "What ill omen occurs on the afternoon that Tess and Angel are leaving for the wedding ceremony?": [" One among her fellow-travellers addressed her more pointedly than any had spoken before: \u201cWhy, you be quite a posy! And such roses in early June!\u201d Then she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised vision: roses at her breasts; roses in her hat; roses and strawberries in her basket to the brim. She blushed, and said confusedly that the flowers had been given to her. When the passengers were not looking she stealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed them in the basket, where she covered them with her handkerchief. Then she fell to reflecting again, and in looking downwards a thorn of the rose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin. Like all the cottagers in Blackmoor Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and prefigurative superstitions; she thought this an ill omen\u2014the first she had noticed that day. The van travelled only so far as Shaston, and there were several miles of pedestrian descent from that mountain-town into the vale to Marlott. Her mother had advised her to stay here for the night, at the house of a cottage-woman they knew, if she should feel too tired to come on; and this Tess did, not descending to her home till the following afternoon. When she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her mother\u2019s triumphant manner that something had occurred in the interim. \u201cOh yes; I know all about it! I told \u2019ee it would be all right, and now \u2019tis proved!\u201d \u201cSince I\u2019ve been away?", " However, Sir John, as we call \u2019n now, kept up the wedding-day as well as he could, and stood treat to everybody in the parish; and John\u2019s wife sung songs at The Pure Drop till past eleven o\u2019clock.\u201d Hearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to go home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings.

She was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the street. Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that he saw her so quickly, and directed his horse so close to the cottage-front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for plants growing under the wall. It was not till he touched the window with his riding-crop that she observed him. The rain had nearly ceased, and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me?\u201d asked d\u2019Urberville. \u201cI was not attending,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard you, I believe, though I fancied it was a carriage and horses.

As for me, I\u2019m a sham one, so it doesn\u2019t matter. It is rather dismal. It is that this sound of a non-existent coach can only be heard by one of d\u2019Urberville blood, and it is held to be of ill-omen to the one who hears it.", " I have thought what joy it will be to do it, what an unworthy wife I shall be if I do not!

Terror was upon her white face as she saw it; her cheek was flaccid, and her mouth had almost the aspect of a round little hole. The horrible sense of his view of her so deadened her that she staggered, and he stepped forward, thinking she was going to fall. \u201cSit down, sit down,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou are ill; and it is natural that you should be.\u201d She did sit down, without knowing where she was, that strained look still upon her face, and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep. \u201cI don\u2019t belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?\u201d she asked helplessly. \u201cIt is not me, but another woman like me that he loved, he says.\u201d The image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was ill-used."], "Where do Tess and Angel go to stay after the wedding?": [" \u201cIt is quite true, all of it; it must be.

Please open it for me!\u201d He undid the parcel. Inside was a case of morocco leather, on the top of which lay a note and a key. The note was for Clare, in the following words: My dear son,\u2014 Possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your godmother, Mrs Pitney, when you were a lad, she\u2014vain, kind woman that she was\u2014left to me a portion of the contents of her jewel-case in trust for your wife, if you should ever have one, as a mark of her affection for you and whomsoever you should choose. This trust I have fulfilled, and the diamonds have been locked up at my banker\u2019s ever since. Though I feel it to be a somewhat incongruous act in the circumstances, I am, as you will see, bound to hand over the articles to the woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will now rightly belong, and they are therefore promptly sent.

It would have embarrassed you, and given us no pleasure. Your bothers felt that very strongly. Now it is done we do not complain, particularly if she suits you for the business you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the Gospel.... Yet I wish I could have seen her first, Angel, or have known a little more about her. We sent her no present of our own, not knowing what would best give her pleasure, but you must suppose it only delayed. Angel, there is no irritation in my mind or your father\u2019s against you for this marriage; but we have thought it much better to reserve our liking for your wife till we could see her.

Some two or three years before Angel\u2019s appearance at the Marlott dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home, a parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller\u2019s, directed to the Reverend James Clare. The Vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm. \u201cWhy has this been sent to my house?\u201d he asked peremptorily, holding up the volume. \u201cIt was ordered, sir.\u201d \u201cNot by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.\u201d The shopkeeper looked into his order-book. \u201cOh, it has been misdirected, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was ordered by Mr Angel Clare, and should have been sent to him.\u201d Mr Clare winced as if he had been struck.

At breakfast, and while they were packing the few remaining articles, he showed his weariness from the night\u2019s effort so unmistakeably that Tess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but the reflection that it would anger him, grieve him, stultify him, to know that he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his common-sense did not approve, that his inclination had compromised his dignity when reason slept, again deterred her. It was too much like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during intoxication. It just crossed her mind, too, that he might have a faint recollection of his tender vagary, and was disinclined to allude to it from a conviction that she would take amatory advantage of the opportunity it gave her of appealing to him anew not to go. He had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and soon after breakfast it arrived. She saw in it the beginning of the end\u2014the temporary end, at least, for the revelation of his tenderness by the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him. The luggage was put on the top, and the man drove them off, the miller and the old waiting-woman expressing some surprise at their precipitate departure, which Clare attributed to his discovery that the mill-work was not of the modern kind which he wished to investigate, a statement that was true so far as it went.", " Surely it was as warmly as ever! He looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought. But he said not a word to her about her revelation, even when they were alone. Could he have had it? Unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing. So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself. Yet he was frank and affectionate as before. Could it be that her doubts were childish? that he forgave her; that he loved her for what she was, just as she was, and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare? Had he really received her note? She glanced into his room, and could see nothing of it. It might be that he forgave her. But even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her. Every morning and night he was the same, and thus New Year\u2019s Eve broke\u2014the wedding day. The lovers did not rise at milking-time, having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her own. When they arrived downstairs at breakfast-time they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it. At some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney-corner to be whitened, and the brick hearth reddened, and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there.", " But, before venturing to make the revelation, dubious Tess indirectly sounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon Mr Clare, by asking the former if Mr Clare had any great respect for old county families when they had lost all their money and land. \u201cMr Clare,\u201d said the dairyman emphatically, \u201cis one of the most rebellest rozums you ever knowed\u2014not a bit like the rest of his family; and if there\u2019s one thing that he do hate more than another \u2019tis the notion of what\u2019s called a\u2019 old family. He says that it stands to reason that old families have done their spurt of work in past days, and can\u2019t have anything left in \u2019em now. There\u2019s the Billets and the Drenkhards and the Greys and the St Quintins and the Hardys and the Goulds, who used to own the lands for miles down this valley; you could buy \u2019em all up now for an old song a\u2019most. Why, our little Retty Priddle here, you know, is one of the Paridelles\u2014the old family that used to own lots o\u2019 the lands out by King\u2019s Hintock, now owned by the Earl o\u2019 Wessex, afore even he or his was heard of. Well, Mr Clare found this out, and spoke quite scornful to the poor girl for days. \u2018Ah!\u2019 he says to her, \u2018you\u2019ll never make a good dairymaid! All your skill was used up ages ago in Palestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength for more deeds!\u2019 A boy came here t\u2019other day asking for a job, and said his name was Matt, and when we asked him his surname he said he\u2019d never heard that \u2019a had any surname, and when we asked why, he said he supposed his folks hadn\u2019t been \u2019stablished long enough.", " Of these boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of his old age, was the only son who had not taken a University degree, though he was the single one of them whose early promise might have done full justice to an academical training.

It was purely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her communications through his father, whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart. \u201cNow,\u201d said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope, \u201cif Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his plans; for I believe it to be from his wife.\u201d He breathed deeply at the thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to Angel. \u201cDear fellow, I hope he will get home safely,\u201d murmured Mrs Clare. \u201cTo my dying day I shall feel that he has been ill-used. You should have sent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given him the same chance as the other boys had.

I didn\u2019t see you till you was in upon me!

Why didn\u2019t ye think of doing some good for your family instead o\u2019 thinking only of yourself? See how I\u2019ve got to teave and slave, and your poor weak father with his heart clogged like a dripping-pan. I did hope for something to come out o\u2019 this!

Part of the remainder she was obliged to expend in winter clothing, leaving only a nominal sum for the whole inclement season at hand. When the last pound had gone, a remark of Angel\u2019s that whenever she required further resources she was to apply to his father, remained to be considered. But the more Tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she to take it. The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be called, on Clare\u2019s account, which had led her to hide from her own parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her owning to his that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her. They probably despised her already; how much more they would despise her in the character of a mendicant! The consequence was that by no effort could the parson\u2019s daughter-in-law bring herself to let him know her state. Her reluctance to communicate with her husband\u2019s parents might, she thought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her own the reverse obtained. On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately going to join her husband; and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return in comfort, hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result in a short stay only, after which he would come to fetch her, or that he would write for her to join him; in any case that they would soon present a united front to their families and the world.", " Angel\u2019s original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a northern or eastern farm in his own country.

But there now followed an unfortunate interval of wet weather, during which she was obliged to fall back upon her sovereigns. She could not bear to let them go. Angel had put them into her hand, had obtained them bright and new from his bank for her; his touch had consecrated them to souvenirs of himself\u2014they appeared to have had as yet no other history than such as was created by his and her own experiences\u2014and to disperse them was like giving away relics. But she had to do it, and one by one they left her hands. She had been compelled to send her mother her address from time to time, but she concealed her circumstances. When her money had almost gone a letter from her mother reached her. Joan stated that they were in dreadful difficulty; the autumn rains had gone through the thatch of the house, which required entire renewal; but this could not be done because the previous thatching had never been paid for. New rafters and a new ceiling upstairs also were required, which, with the previous bill, would amount to a sum of twenty pounds. As her husband was a man of means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send them the money?", " Ah, if I could only make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine does every day and all day long, it might lead you to show pity to your poor lonely one.... I would be content, ay, glad, to live with you as your servant, if I may not as your wife; so that I could only be near you, and get glimpses of you, and think of you as mine.... I long for only one thing in heaven or earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own dear! Come to me\u2014come to me, and save me from what threatens me! Clare determined that he would no longer believe in her more recent and severer regard of him, but would go and find her immediately. He asked his father if she had applied for any money during his absence. His father returned a negative, and then for the first time it occurred to Angel that her pride had stood in her way, and that she had suffered privation. From his remarks his parents now gathered the real reason of the separation; and their Christianity was such that, reprobates being their especial care, the tenderness towards Tess which her blood, her simplicity, even her poverty, had not engendered, was instantly excited by her sin. Whilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey he glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to hand\u2014the one from Marian and Izz Huett, beginning\u2014 \u201cHonour\u2019d Sir, Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do love you,\u201d and signed, \u201cFrom Two Well-Wishers.\u201d LIV In a quarter of an hour Clare was leaving the house, whence his mother watched his thin figure as it disappeared into the street.", " Lord, that\u2019s the only comfort I\u2019ve got now!

There was not a tree within sight; there was not, at this season, a green pasture\u2014nothing but fallow and turnips everywhere, in large fields divided by hedges plashed to unrelieved levels. Tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of workfolk had received their wages, and then Marian introduced her. The farmer himself, it appeared, was not at home, but his wife, who represented him this evening, made no objection to hiring Tess, on her agreeing to remain till Old Lady-Day. Female field-labour was seldom offered now, and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks which women could perform as readily as men."], "How does Tess try to protect herself from lustful men?": [" They rested here a while, and entering the Vale were next driven onward towards her home by a stranger who did not know their relations. At a midway point, when Nuttlebury had been passed, and where there were cross-roads, Clare stopped the conveyance and said to Tess that if she meant to return to her mother\u2019s house it was here that he would leave her. As they could not talk with freedom in the driver\u2019s presence he asked her to accompany him for a few steps on foot along one of the branch roads; she assented, and directing the man to wait a few minutes they strolled away. \u201cNow, let us understand each other,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThere is no anger between us, though there is that which I cannot endure at present. I will try to bring myself to endure it. I will let you know where I go to as soon as I know myself. And if I can bring myself to bear it\u2014if it is desirable, possible\u2014I will come to you. But until I come to you it will be better that you should not try to come to me.\u201d The severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess; she saw his view of her clearly enough; he could regard her in no other light than that of one who had practised gross deceit upon him. Yet could a woman who had done even what she had done deserve all this? But she could contest the point with him no further. She simply repeated after him his own words. \u201cUntil you come to me I must not try to come to you?\u201d \u201cJust so.\u201d \u201cMay I write to you?\u201d \u201cO yes\u2014if you are ill, or want anything at all.", " Tess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it; and then her mother broached her scheme. \u201cWe must take the ups wi\u2019 the downs, Tess,\u201d said she; \u201cand never could your high blood have been found out at a more called-for moment.

She attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural severity. But he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of him, she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note; laughing distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that she had laughed. He encouraged her with \u201cTry again!\u201d Tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she tried\u2014ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound. The momentary pleasure of success got the better of her; her eyes enlarged, and she involuntarily smiled in his face. \u201cThat\u2019s it! Now I have started you\u2014you\u2019ll go on beautifully. There\u2014I said I would not come near you; and, in spite of such temptation as never before fell to mortal man, I\u2019ll keep my word.... Tess, do you think my mother a queer old soul?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know much of her yet, sir.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll find her so; she must be, to make you learn to whistle to her bullfinches."], "What do Tess and Marian work at digging up at the farm near Flintcomb-Ash?": [" Having signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do at present than to get a lodging, and she found one in the house at whose gable-wall she had warmed herself. It was a poor subsistence that she had ensured, but it would afford a shelter for the winter at any rate. That night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address, in case a letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband. But she did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation: it might have brought reproach upon him. XLIII There was no exaggeration in Marian\u2019s definition of Flintcomb-Ash farm as a starve-acre place. The single fat thing on the soil was Marian herself; and she was an importation. Of the three classes of village, the village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by itself, and the village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other words, the village of a resident squire\u2019s tenantry, the village of free or copy-holders, and the absentee-owner\u2019s village, farmed with the land) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third. But Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with physical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel Clare; and it sustained her. The swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a stretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of the farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets\u2014the outcrop of siliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose white flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes.", " Some of the households were lively, some mournful; some were stopping at the doors of wayside inns; where, in due time, the Durbeyfield menagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers. During the halt Tess\u2019s eyes fell upon a three-pint blue mug, which was ascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine section of a household, sitting on the summit of a load that had also drawn up at a little distance from the same inn. She followed one of the mug\u2019s journeys upward, and perceived it to be clasped by hands whose owner she well knew. Tess went towards the waggon. \u201cMarian and Izz!\u201d she cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting with the moving family at whose house they had lodged. \u201cAre you house-ridding to-day, like everybody else?\u201d They were, they said. It had been too rough a life for them at Flintcomb-Ash, and they had come away, almost without notice, leaving Groby to prosecute them if he chose. They told Tess their destination, and Tess told them hers. Marian leant over the load, and lowered her voice. \u201cDo you know that the gentleman who follows \u2019ee\u2014you\u2019ll guess who I mean\u2014came to ask for \u2019ee at Flintcomb after you had gone? We didn\u2019t tell\u2019n where you was, knowing you wouldn\u2019t wish to see him.\u201d \u201cAh\u2014but I did see him!\u201d Tess murmured. \u201cHe found me.\u201d \u201cAnd do he know where you be going?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d \u201cHusband come back?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d She bade her acquaintance goodbye\u2014for the respective carters had now come out from the inn\u2014and the two waggons resumed their journey in opposite directions; the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the ploughman\u2019s family with whom they had thrown in their lot, being brightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass ornaments on their harness; while the waggon on which Mrs Durbeyfield and her family rode was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear the weight of the superincumbent load; one which had known no paint since it was made, and drawn by two horses only.", " The wall seemed to be the only friend she had. She had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night. Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage\u2014gathered together after their day\u2019s labour\u2014talking to each other within, and the rattle of their supper-plates was also audible. But in the village-street she had seen no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the approach of one feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold, wore the print gown and the tilt-bonnet of summer time. Tess instinctively thought it might be Marian, and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in the gloom, surely enough it was she. Marian was even stouter and redder in the face than formerly, and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any previous period of her existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive, and she responded readily to Marian\u2019s greeting. Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved by the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition than at first; though she had dimly heard of the separation. \u201cTess\u2014Mrs Clare\u2014the dear wife of dear he! And is it really so bad as this, my child? Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way? Anybody been beating \u2019ee? Not _he_?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no! I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled, Marian.\u201d She pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild thoughts.", " \u201cAnd so on. My dear Tess, I am only putting this to you as a thing that you might have supposed or said quite untruly, because you think so badly of me.\u201d \u201cI never said you were Satan, or thought it. I don\u2019t think of you in that way at all. My thoughts of you are quite cold, except when you affront me. What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?\u201d \u201cEntirely. To see you; nothing more. The smockfrock, which I saw hanging for sale as I came along, was an afterthought, that I mightn\u2019t be noticed. I come to protest against your working like this.\u201d \u201cBut I like doing it\u2014it is for my father.\u201d \u201cYour engagement at the other place is ended?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere are you going to next? To join your dear husband?\u201d She could not bear the humiliating reminder. \u201cO\u2014I don\u2019t know!\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cI have no husband!\u201d \u201cIt is quite true\u2014in the sense you mean. But you have a friend, and I have determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself. When you get down to your house you will see what I have sent there for you.\u201d \u201cO, Alec, I wish you wouldn\u2019t give me anything at all! I cannot take it from you! I don\u2019t like\u2014it is not right!\u201d \u201cIt _is_ right!\u201d he cried lightly. \u201cI am not going to see a woman whom I feel so tenderly for as I do for you in trouble without trying to help her.\u201d \u201cBut I am very well off! I am only in trouble about\u2014about\u2014not about living at all!\u201d She turned, and desperately resumed her digging, tears dripping upon the fork-handle and upon the clods."], "What items of Tess\u2019s do the Clares find, assuming that they belong to a peasant?": [" \u201cO Angel\u2014my mother says that it sometimes happens so!\u2014she knows several cases where they were worse than I, and the husband has not minded it much\u2014has got over it at least. And yet the woman had not loved him as I do you!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t, Tess; don\u2019t argue. Different societies, different manners. You almost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman, who have never been initiated into the proportions of social things. You don\u2019t know what you say.\u201d \u201cI am only a peasant by position, not by nature!\u201d She spoke with an impulse to anger, but it went as it came. \u201cSo much the worse for you. I think that parson who unearthed your pedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue. I cannot help associating your decline as a family with this other fact\u2014of your want of firmness. Decrepit families imply decrepit wills, decrepit conduct. Heaven, why did you give me a handle for despising you more by informing me of your descent! Here was I thinking you a new-sprung child of nature; there were you, the belated seedling of an effete aristocracy!\u201d \u201cLots of families are as bad as mine in that! Retty\u2019s family were once large landowners, and so were Dairyman Billett\u2019s. And the Debbyhouses, who now are carters, were once the De Bayeux family. You find such as I everywhere; \u2019tis a feature of our county, and I can\u2019t help it.\u201d \u201cSo much the worse for the county.\u201d She took these reproaches in their bulk simply, not in their particulars; he did not love her as he had loved her hitherto, and to all else she was indifferent.", " But had he not been cruelly blinded? In the incoherent multitude of his emotions he knelt down at the bedside wet-eyed. \u201cO Tess! If you had only told me sooner, I would have forgiven you!\u201d he mourned. Hearing a footstep below, he rose and went to the top of the stairs. At the bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing, and on her turning up her face recognized the pale, dark-eyed Izz Huett. \u201cMr Clare,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve called to see you and Mrs Clare, and to inquire if ye be well. I thought you might be back here again.\u201d This was a girl whose secret he had guessed, but who had not yet guessed his; an honest girl who loved him\u2014one who would have made as good, or nearly as good, a practical farmer\u2019s wife as Tess. \u201cI am here alone,\u201d he said; \u201cwe are not living here now.\u201d Explaining why he had come, he asked, \u201cWhich way are you going home, Izz?\u201d \u201cI have no home at Talbothays Dairy now, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d Izz looked down. \u201cIt was so dismal there that I left! I am staying out this way.\u201d She pointed in a contrary direction, the direction in which he was journeying. \u201cWell\u2014are you going there now? I can take you if you wish for a lift.\u201d Her olive complexion grew richer in hue. \u201cThank \u2019ee, Mr Clare,\u201d she said. He soon found the farmer, and settled the account for his rent and the few other items which had to be considered by reason of the sudden abandonment of the lodgings. On Clare\u2019s return to his horse and gig, Izz jumped up beside him.", " The atmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges, arose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and Tess showed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood in front of her was already assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the sun rose a hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay alongside, still and stark; his eyes half open, the hole in his chest looking scarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him. \u201c\u2019Tis all my doing\u2014all mine!\u201d the girl cried, gazing at the spectacle. \u201cNo excuse for me\u2014none. What will mother and father live on now? Aby, Aby!\u201d She shook the child, who had slept soundly through the whole disaster. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on with our load\u2014Prince is killed!\u201d When Abraham realized all, the furrows of fifty years were extemporized on his young face. \u201cWhy, I danced and laughed only yesterday!\u201d she went on to herself. \u201cTo think that I was such a fool!\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn\u2019t it, Tess?\u201d murmured Abraham through his tears. In silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless. At length a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the driver of the mail-car had been as good as his word. A farmer\u2019s man from near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob. He was harnessed to the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the load taken on towards Casterbridge.", " What had been the engrossing world had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show; while here, in this apparently dim and unimpassioned place, novelty had volcanically started up, as it had never, for him, started up elsewhere. Every window of the house being open, Clare could hear across the yard each trivial sound of the retiring household. The dairy-house, so humble, so insignificant, so purely to him a place of constrained sojourn that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance to be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the landscape; what was it now? The aged and lichened brick gables breathed forth \u201cStay!\u201d The windows smiled, the door coaxed and beckoned, the creeper blushed confederacy. A personality within it was so far-reaching in her influence as to spread into and make the bricks, mortar, and whole overhanging sky throb with a burning sensibility. Whose was this mighty personality? A milkmaid\u2019s. It was amazing, indeed, to find how great a matter the life of the obscure dairy had become to him. And though new love was to be held partly responsible for this, it was not solely so. Many besides Angel have learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their external displacements, but as to their subjective experiences. The impressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life than the pachydermatous king. Looking at it thus, he found that life was to be seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere."], "What does Tess feel when Alec preaches about his religious conversion?": [" What don\u2019t you believe?\u201d \u201cYour conversion. Your scheme of religion.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d She dropped her voice. \u201cBecause a better man than you does not believe in such.\u201d \u201cWhat a woman\u2019s reason! Who is this better man?\u201d \u201cI cannot tell you.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he declared, a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to spring out at a moment\u2019s notice, \u201cGod forbid that I should say I am a good man\u2014and you know I don\u2019t say any such thing.

The inferior man was quiet in him now; but it was surely not extracted, nor even entirely subdued. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d he said abruptly. Tess, who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien, instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes, stammering with a flush, \u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d And there was revived in her the wretched sentiment which had often come to her before, that in inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which Nature had endowed her she was somehow doing wrong. \u201cNo, no!

I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?\u201d \u201cSure, I don\u2019t trouble you any-when!\u201d \u201cYou say you don\u2019t? But you do! You haunt me. Those very eyes that you turned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago, they come to me just as you showed them then, in the night and in the day! Tess, ever since you told me of that child of ours, it is just as if my feelings, which have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream, had suddenly found a way open in the direction of you, and had all at once gushed through. The religious channel is left dry forthwith; and it is you who have done it!\u201d She gazed in silence. \u201cWhat\u2014you have given up your preaching entirely?\u201d she asked. She had gathered from Angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern thought to despise flash enthusiasm; but, as a woman, she was somewhat appalled."], "What does Alec read from to calm himself after seeing Tess?": [" Every man must work as he could best work, and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the Spirit. D\u2019Urberville read and re-read this letter, and seemed to quiz himself cynically. He also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till his face assumed a calm, and apparently the image of Tess no longer troubled his mind. She meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her nearest way home. Within the distance of a mile she met a solitary shepherd. \u201cWhat is the meaning of that old stone I have passed?\u201d she asked of him. \u201cWas it ever a Holy Cross?\u201d \u201cCross\u2014no; \u2019twer not a cross! \u2019Tis a thing of ill-omen, Miss. It was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung. The bones lie underneath. They say he sold his soul to the devil, and that he walks at times.\u201d She felt the _petite mort_ at this unexpectedly gruesome information, and left the solitary man behind her. It was dusk when she drew near to Flintcomb-Ash, and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she approached a girl and her lover without their observing her. They were talking no secrets, and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman, in response to the warmer accents of the man, spread into the chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon, full of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded.", " And living in such seclusion she naturally had scarce ever seen any young man from the world without till she saw you.\u201d \u201cScarcely.\u201d \u201cYou were her first love?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cThere are worse wives than these simple, rosy-mouthed, robust girls of the farm. Certainly I could have wished\u2014well, since my son is to be an agriculturist, it is perhaps but proper that his wife should have been accustomed to an outdoor life.\u201d His father was less inquisitive; but when the time came for the chapter from the Bible which was always read before evening prayers, the Vicar observed to Mrs Clare\u2014 \u201cI think, since Angel has come, that it will be more appropriate to read the thirty-first of Proverbs than the chapter which we should have had in the usual course of our reading?\u201d \u201cYes, certainly,\u201d said Mrs Clare. \u201cThe words of King Lemuel\u201d (she could cite chapter and verse as well as her husband). \u201cMy dear son, your father has decided to read us the chapter in Proverbs in praise of a virtuous wife. We shall not need to be reminded to apply the words to the absent one. May Heaven shield her in all her ways!\u201d A lump rose in Clare\u2019s throat. The portable lectern was taken out from the corner and set in the middle of the fireplace, the two old servants came in, and Angel\u2019s father began to read at the tenth verse of the aforesaid chapter\u2014 \u201cWho can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. She riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household.", " \u201cBut let us try further on, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess, what\u2019s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!\u201d Accompanied by \u2019Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. \u201cAh\u2014I\u2019m looking for you!\u201d he said, riding up to them. \u201cThis is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!\u201d It was Alec d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhere is Tess?\u201d he asked. Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the direction of the church, and went on, d\u2019Urberville saying that he would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone, d\u2019Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot. In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead, remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall. The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first time in her life. Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff.", " In the candlelight the painting was more than unpleasant. Sinister design lurked in the woman\u2019s features, a concentrated purpose of revenge on the other sex\u2014so it seemed to him then. The Caroline bodice of the portrait was low\u2014precisely as Tess\u2019s had been when he tucked it in to show the necklace; and again he experienced the distressing sensation of a resemblance between them. The check was sufficient. He resumed his retreat and descended. His air remained calm and cold, his small compressed mouth indexing his powers of self-control; his face wearing still that terrible sterile expression which had spread thereon since her disclosure. It was the face of a man who was no longer passion\u2019s slave, yet who found no advantage in his enfranchisement. He was simply regarding the harrowing contingencies of human experience, the unexpectedness of things. Nothing so pure, so sweet, so virginal as Tess had seemed possible all the long while that he had adored her, up to an hour ago; but The little less, and what worlds away! He argued erroneously when he said to himself that her heart was not indexed in the honest freshness of her face; but Tess had no advocate to set him right. Could it be possible, he continued, that eyes which as they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was telling, were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one, discordant and contrasting?"], "When Alec proposes to Tess in the fields, where does he suggest they go to become missionaries?": [" II The village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the beautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape-painter, though within a four hours\u2019 journey from London. It is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the summits of the hills that surround it\u2014except perhaps during the droughts of summer. An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather is apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry ways. This fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the bold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill, Bulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The traveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of miles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge of one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold, extended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from that which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the sun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character to the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the atmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be constructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere paddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a network of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the grass.", " I long for only one thing in heaven or earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own dear! Come to me\u2014come to me, and save me from what threatens me!\u2014 Your faithful heartbroken Tess XLIX The appeal duly found its way to the breakfast-table of the quiet Vicarage to the westward, in that valley where the air is so soft and the soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid by comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb-Ash, and where to Tess the human world seemed so different (though it was much the same). It was purely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her communications through his father, whom he kept pretty well informed of his changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for himself with a heavy heart. \u201cNow,\u201d said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope, \u201cif Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next month, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his plans; for I believe it to be from his wife.\u201d He breathed deeply at the thought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to Angel. \u201cDear fellow, I hope he will get home safely,\u201d murmured Mrs Clare. \u201cTo my dying day I shall feel that he has been ill-used. You should have sent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given him the same chance as the other boys had. He would have grown out of it under proper influence, and perhaps would have taken Orders after all.", " \u201cAnd then\u2014there is something very unusual about it\u2014about me. I\u2014I was\u2014\u201d Tess\u2019s breath quickened. \u201cYes, dearest. Never mind.\u201d \u201cI\u2014I\u2014am not a Durbeyfield, but a d\u2019Urberville\u2014a descendant of the same family as those that owned the old house we passed. And\u2014we are all gone to nothing!\u201d \u201cA d\u2019Urberville!\u2014Indeed! And is that all the trouble, dear Tess?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she answered faintly. \u201cWell\u2014why should I love you less after knowing this?\u201d \u201cI was told by the dairyman that you hated old families.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWell, it is true, in one sense. I do hate the aristocratic principle of blood before everything, and do think that as reasoners the only pedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of the wise and virtuous, without regard to corporal paternity. But I am extremely interested in this news\u2014you can have no idea how interested I am! Are you not interested yourself in being one of that well-known line?\u201d \u201cNo. I have thought it sad\u2014especially since coming here, and knowing that many of the hills and fields I see once belonged to my father\u2019s people. But other hills and fields belonged to Retty\u2019s people, and perhaps others to Marian\u2019s, so that I don\u2019t value it particularly.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014it is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil were once owners of it, and I sometimes wonder that a certain school of politicians don\u2019t make capital of the circumstance; but they don\u2019t seem to know it...", " The wall seemed to be the only friend she had. She had so little wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night. Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage\u2014gathered together after their day\u2019s labour\u2014talking to each other within, and the rattle of their supper-plates was also audible. But in the village-street she had seen no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the approach of one feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold, wore the print gown and the tilt-bonnet of summer time. Tess instinctively thought it might be Marian, and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in the gloom, surely enough it was she. Marian was even stouter and redder in the face than formerly, and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any previous period of her existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance in such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive, and she responded readily to Marian\u2019s greeting. Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved by the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition than at first; though she had dimly heard of the separation. \u201cTess\u2014Mrs Clare\u2014the dear wife of dear he! And is it really so bad as this, my child? Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way? Anybody been beating \u2019ee? Not _he_?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no! I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled, Marian.\u201d She pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild thoughts."], "When Alec says that Angel is neglecting Tess, what does Tess strike Alec with?": [" In Saint Charles\u2019s days we was made Knights o\u2019 the Royal Oak, our real name being d\u2019Urberville!... Don\u2019t that make your bosom plim? \u2019Twas on this account that your father rode home in the vlee; not because he\u2019d been drinking, as people supposed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad of that. Will it do us any good, mother?\u201d \u201cO yes! \u2019Tis thoughted that great things may come o\u2019t. No doubt a mampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as soon as \u2019tis known. Your father learnt it on his way hwome from Shaston, and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter.\u201d \u201cWhere is father now?\u201d asked Tess suddenly. Her mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: \u201cHe called to see the doctor to-day in Shaston. It is not consumption at all, it seems. It is fat round his heart, \u2019a says. There, it is like this.\u201d Joan Durbeyfield, as she spoke, curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to the shape of the letter C, and used the other forefinger as a pointer. \u201c\u2018At the present moment,\u2019 he says to your father, \u2018your heart is enclosed all round there, and all round there; this space is still open,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018As soon as it do meet, so,\u2019\u201d\u2014Mrs Durbeyfield closed her fingers into a circle complete\u2014\u201c\u2018off you will go like a shadder, Mr Durbeyfield,\u2019 \u2019a says. \u2018You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten months, or ten days.\u2019\u201d Tess looked alarmed. Her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud so soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!", " My eyes were dazed by you for a little, and that was all.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. She resumed\u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t understand your meaning till it was too late.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what every woman says.\u201d \u201cHow can you dare to use such words!\u201d she cried, turning impetuously upon him, her eyes flashing as the latent spirit (of which he was to see more some day) awoke in her. \u201cMy God! I could knock you out of the gig! Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, laughing; \u201cI am sorry to wound you. I did wrong\u2014I admit it.\u201d He dropped into some little bitterness as he continued: \u201cOnly you needn\u2019t be so everlastingly flinging it in my face. I am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing. You know you need not work in the fields or the dairies again. You know you may clothe yourself with the best, instead of in the bald plain way you have lately affected, as if you couldn\u2019t get a ribbon more than you earn.\u201d Her lip lifted slightly, though there was little scorn, as a rule, in her large and impulsive nature. \u201cI have said I will not take anything more from you, and I will not\u2014I cannot! I _should_ be your creature to go on doing that, and I won\u2019t!\u201d \u201cOne would think you were a princess from your manner, in addition to a true and original d\u2019Urberville\u2014ha! ha! Well, Tess, dear, I can say no more. I suppose I am a bad fellow\u2014a damn bad fellow. I was born bad, and I have lived bad, and I shall die bad in all probability.", " For several days after Tess\u2019s arrival Clare, sitting abstractedly reading from some book, periodical, or piece of music just come by post, hardly noticed that she was present at table. She talked so little, and the other maids talked so much, that the babble did not strike him as possessing a new note, and he was ever in the habit of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general impression. One day, however, when he had been conning one of his music-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in his head, he lapsed into listlessness, and the music-sheet rolled to the hearth. He looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast-cooking and boiling, and it seemed to jig to his inward tune; also at the two chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterel, or cross-bar, plumed with soot, which quivered to the same melody; also at the half-empty kettle whining an accompaniment. The conversation at the table mixed in with his phantasmal orchestra till he thought: \u201cWhat a fluty voice one of those milkmaids has! I suppose it is the new one.\u201d Clare looked round upon her, seated with the others. She was not looking towards him. Indeed, owing to his long silence, his presence in the room was almost forgotten. \u201cI don\u2019t know about ghosts,\u201d she was saying; \u201cbut I do know that our souls can be made to go outside our bodies when we are alive.\u201d The dairyman turned to her with his mouth full, his eyes charged with serious inquiry, and his great knife and fork (breakfasts were breakfasts here) planted erect on the table, like the beginning of a gallows.", " \u201cBut let us try further on, and get something for the dears to eat!

Tess could eventually join him there, and perhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits the conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem impracticable to him here. In brief he was strongly inclined to try Brazil, especially as the season for going thither was just at hand. With this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan to his parents, and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving without Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated them. As he reached the door the new moon shone upon his face, just as the old one had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his wife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks; but his face was thinner now. Clare had given his parents no warning of his visit, and his arrival stirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher stirs a quiet pool. His father and mother were both in the drawing-room, but neither of his brothers was now at home. Angel entered, and closed the door quietly behind him. \u201cBut\u2014where\u2019s your wife, dear Angel?\u201d cried his mother. \u201cHow you surprise us!\u201d \u201cShe is at her mother\u2019s\u2014temporarily. I have come home rather in a hurry because I\u2019ve decided to go to Brazil.\u201d \u201cBrazil! Why they are all Roman Catholics there surely!\u201d \u201cAre they? I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d But even the novelty and painfulness of his going to a Papistical land could not displace for long Mr and Mrs Clare\u2019s natural interest in their son\u2019s marriage.", " It was a pretty lover\u2019s dream, if no more. Perhaps Tess\u2019s lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside. Her perception that Angel\u2019s bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it. She rose from breakfast before he had finished, and hastened upstairs. It had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare\u2019s den, or rather eyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment, regarding and pondering. She stooped to the threshold of the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement. The carpet reached close to the sill, and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him, which he obviously had never seen, owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door. With a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter. There it was\u2014sealed up, just as it had left her hands. The mountain had not yet been removed. She could not let him read it now, the house being in full bustle of preparation; and descending to her own room she destroyed the letter there. She was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious. The incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a confession; but she knew in her conscience that it need not; there was still time.", " He deserved no more. His had been a love \u201cwhich alters when it alteration finds\u201d. He had undergone some strange experiences in his absence; he had seen the virtual Faustina in the literal Cornelia, a spiritual Lucretia in a corporeal Phryne; he had thought of the woman taken and set in the midst as one deserving to be stoned, and of the wife of Uriah being made a queen; and he had asked himself why he had not judged Tess constructively rather than biographically, by the will rather than by the deed? A day or two passed while he waited at his father\u2019s house for the promised second note from Joan Durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover a little more strength. The strength showed signs of coming back, but there was no sign of Joan\u2019s letter. Then he hunted up the old letter sent on to him in Brazil, which Tess had written from Flintcomb-Ash, and re-read it. The sentences touched him now as much as when he had first perused them. ...I must cry to you in my trouble\u2014I have no one else!... I think I must die if you do not come soon, or tell me to come to you... please, please, not to be just\u2014only a little kind to me.... If you would come, I could die in your arms! I would be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me!... if you will send me one little line, and say, _I am coming soon_, I will bide on, Angel\u2014O, so cheerfully!... think how it do hurt my heart not to see you ever\u2014ever!", " Angel\u2019s original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a northern or eastern farm in his own country. He had come to this place in a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English agriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape from his past existence. During this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years. What arrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its pathos. Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism, he now began to discredit the old appraisements of morality. He thought they wanted readjusting. Who was the moral man? Still more pertinently, who was the moral woman? The beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only in its achievements, but in its aims and impulses; its true history lay, not among things done, but among things willed. How, then, about Tess? Viewing her in these lights, a regret for his hasty judgement began to oppress him. Did he reject her eternally, or did he not? He could no longer say that he would always reject her, and not to say that was in spirit to accept her now. This growing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time with her residence at Flintcomb-Ash, but it was before she had felt herself at liberty to trouble him with a word about her circumstances or her feelings. He was greatly perplexed; and in his perplexity as to her motives in withholding intelligence, he did not inquire."], "Who brings word that Tess\u2019s mother is dying?": [" It was from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair. Then a man\u2019s voice from the adjoining bedroom\u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She did not answer, but went on, in a tone which was a soliloquy rather than an exclamation, and a dirge rather than a soliloquy. Mrs Brooks could only catch a portion: \u201cAnd then my dear, dear husband came home to me ... and I did not know it!... And you had used your cruel persuasion upon me ... you did not stop using it\u2014no\u2014you did not stop! My little sisters and brothers and my mother\u2019s needs\u2014they were the things you moved me by ... and you said my husband would never come back\u2014never; and you taunted me, and said what a simpleton I was to expect him!... And at last I believed you and gave way!... And then he came back! Now he is gone. Gone a second time, and I have lost him now for ever ... and he will not love me the littlest bit ever any more\u2014only hate me!... O yes, I have lost him now\u2014again because of\u2014you!\u201d In writhing, with her head on the chair, she turned her face towards the door, and Mrs Brooks could see the pain upon it, and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth upon them, and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet tags to her cheeks. She continued: \u201cAnd he is dying\u2014he looks as if he is dying!... And my sin will kill him and not kill me!... O, you have torn my life all to pieces ... made me be what I prayed you in pity not to make me be again!...", " \u201cIzz\u2014please, please forget my momentary levity!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt was so ill-considered, so ill-advised!\u201d \u201cForget it? Never, never! O, it was no levity to me!\u201d He felt how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry conveyed, and, in a sorrow that was inexpressible, leapt down and took her hand. \u201cWell, but, Izz, we\u2019ll part friends, anyhow? You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve had to bear!\u201d She was a really generous girl, and allowed no further bitterness to mar their adieux. \u201cI forgive \u2019ee, sir!\u201d she said. \u201cNow, Izz,\u201d he said, while she stood beside him there, forcing himself to the mentor\u2019s part he was far from feeling; \u201cI want you to tell Marian when you see her that she is to be a good woman, and not to give way to folly. Promise that, and tell Retty that there are more worthy men than I in the world, that for my sake she is to act wisely and well\u2014remember the words\u2014wisely and well\u2014for my sake. I send this message to them as a dying man to the dying; for I shall never see them again. And you, Izzy, you have saved me by your honest words about my wife from an incredible impulse towards folly and treachery. Women may be bad, but they are not so bad as men in these things! On that one account I can never forget you. Be always the good and sincere girl you have hitherto been; and think of me as a worthless lover, but a faithful friend. Promise.\u201d She gave the promise. \u201cHeaven bless and keep you, sir.", " She brings the ends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it, beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the breeze. A bit of her naked arm is visible between the buff leather of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her gown; and as the day wears on its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds. At intervals she stands up to rest, and to retie her disarranged apron, or to pull her bonnet straight. Then one can see the oval face of a handsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy clinging tresses, which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything they fall against. The cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular, the red lips thinner than is usual in a country-bred girl. It is Tess Durbeyfield, otherwise d\u2019Urberville, somewhat changed\u2014the same, but not the same; at the present stage of her existence living as a stranger and an alien here, though it was no strange land that she was in. After a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to undertake outdoor work in her native village, the busiest season of the year in the agricultural world having arrived, and nothing that she could do within the house being so remunerative for the time as harvesting in the fields. The movements of the other women were more or less similar to Tess\u2019s, the whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille at the completion of a sheaf by each, every one placing her sheaf on end against those of the rest, till a shock, or \u201cstitch\u201d as it was here called, of ten or a dozen was formed.", " I had no idea of what had resulted till you told me. Scamp that I was to foul that innocent life! The whole blame was mine\u2014the whole unconventional business of our time at Trantridge. You, too, the real blood of which I am but the base imitation, what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities! I say in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked may set for them, whether their motive be a good one or the result of simple indifference.\u201d Tess still did no more than listen, throwing down one globular root and taking up another with automatic regularity, the pensive contour of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her. \u201cBut it is not that I came to say,\u201d d\u2019Urberville went on. \u201cMy circumstances are these. I have lost my mother since you were at Trantridge, and the place is my own. But I intend to sell it, and devote myself to missionary work in Africa. A devil of a poor hand I shall make at the trade, no doubt. However, what I want to ask you is, will you put it in my power to do my duty\u2014to make the only reparation I can make for the trick played you: that is, will you be my wife, and go with me?... I have already obtained this precious document. It was my old mother\u2019s dying wish.\u201d He drew a piece of parchment from his pocket, with a slight fumbling of embarrassment. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d said she."], "After Tess\u2019s father dies, they lose the house because the landlord wants to use it for ___.": [" It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two; and I wish there were not\u2014except \u2019Liza-Lu.\u201d Clare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little lighter, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and sat down by her side. \u201cAngel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over \u2019Liza-Lu for my sake?\u201d she asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind among the pillars. \u201cI will.\u201d \u201cShe is so good and simple and pure. O, Angel\u2014I wish you would marry her if you lose me, as you will do shortly. O, if you would!\u201d \u201cIf I lose you I lose all! And she is my sister-in-law.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, dearest. People marry sister-laws continually about Marlott; and \u2019Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she is growing so beautiful. O, I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits! If you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her up for your own self!... She had all the best of me without the bad of me; and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not divided us... Well, I have said it. I won\u2019t mention it again.\u201d She ceased, and he fell into thought. In the far north-east sky he could see between the pillars a level streak of light. The uniform concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot, letting in at the earth\u2019s edge the coming day, against which the towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined.", " \u201cAbout the children\u2014your brothers and sisters,\u201d he resumed. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of them.\u201d Tess\u2019s heart quivered\u2014he was touching her in a weak place. He had divined her chief anxiety. Since returning home her soul had gone out to those children with an affection that was passionate. \u201cIf your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for them; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?\u201d \u201cHe can with my assistance. He must!\u201d \u201cAnd with mine.\u201d \u201cNo, sir!\u201d \u201cHow damned foolish this is!\u201d burst out d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhy, he thinks we are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!\u201d \u201cHe don\u2019t. I\u2019ve undeceived him.\u201d \u201cThe more fool you!\u201d D\u2019Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he pulled off the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling it up and pushing it into the couch-fire, went away. Tess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless; she wondered if he had gone back to her father\u2019s house; and taking the fork in her hand proceeded homewards. Some twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters. \u201cO, Tessy\u2014what do you think! \u2019Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there\u2019s a lot of folk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think father is dead!\u201d The child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its sadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till, beholding the effect produced upon her, she said\u2014 \u201cWhat, Tess, shan\u2019t we talk to father never no more?\u201d \u201cBut father was only a little bit ill!\u201d exclaimed Tess distractedly.", " Perhaps he revered his father\u2019s practice even more now than ever, seeing that, in the question of making Tessy his wife, his father had not once thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless. The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel\u2019s getting a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel admired it none the less. Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren. XXVII An up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd miles through a garish mid-day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a mile or two west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that green trough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or Froom. Immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals, the very bees and butterflies drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads. It was with a sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in his student-days; and, much as he loved his parents, he could not help being aware that to come here, as now, after an experience of home-life, affected him like throwing off splints and bandages; even the one customary curb on the humours of English rural societies being absent in this place, Talbothays having no resident landlord.", " When she came in her mother pursued her advantage. \u201cWell, what be you going to do?\u201d she asked. \u201cI wish I had seen Mrs d\u2019Urberville,\u201d said Tess. \u201cI think you mid as well settle it. Then you\u2019ll see her soon enough.\u201d Her father coughed in his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say!\u201d answered the girl restlessly. \u201cIt is for you to decide. I killed the old horse, and I suppose I ought to do something to get ye a new one. But\u2014but\u2014I don\u2019t quite like Mr d\u2019Urberville being there!\u201d The children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by their wealthy kinsfolk (which they imagined the other family to be) as a species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry at Tess\u2019s reluctance, and teased and reproached her for hesitating. \u201cTess won\u2019t go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy of!\u2014no, she says she wo-o-on\u2019t!\u201d they wailed, with square mouths. \u201cAnd we shan\u2019t have a nice new horse, and lots o\u2019 golden money to buy fairlings! And Tess won\u2019t look pretty in her best cloze no mo-o-ore!\u201d Her mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of making her labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them indefinitely, also weighed in the argument. Her father alone preserved an attitude of neutrality. \u201cI will go,\u201d said Tess at last. Her mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision conjured up by the girl\u2019s consent. \u201cThat\u2019s right! For such a pretty maid as \u2019tis, this is a fine chance!\u201d Tess smiled crossly."], "According to d\u2019Urberville family lore, what ghostly sound is supposed to be a bad omen?": [" My eyes were dazed by you for a little, and that was all.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. She resumed\u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t understand your meaning till it was too late.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what every woman says.\u201d \u201cHow can you dare to use such words!\u201d she cried, turning impetuously upon him, her eyes flashing as the latent spirit (of which he was to see more some day) awoke in her. \u201cMy God! I could knock you out of the gig! Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some women may feel?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, laughing; \u201cI am sorry to wound you. I did wrong\u2014I admit it.\u201d He dropped into some little bitterness as he continued: \u201cOnly you needn\u2019t be so everlastingly flinging it in my face. I am ready to pay to the uttermost farthing. You know you need not work in the fields or the dairies again. You know you may clothe yourself with the best, instead of in the bald plain way you have lately affected, as if you couldn\u2019t get a ribbon more than you earn.\u201d Her lip lifted slightly, though there was little scorn, as a rule, in her large and impulsive nature. \u201cI have said I will not take anything more from you, and I will not\u2014I cannot! I _should_ be your creature to go on doing that, and I won\u2019t!\u201d \u201cOne would think you were a princess from your manner, in addition to a true and original d\u2019Urberville\u2014ha! ha! Well, Tess, dear, I can say no more. I suppose I am a bad fellow\u2014a damn bad fellow. I was born bad, and I have lived bad, and I shall die bad in all probability.", " By this means they had found that she was living here again; her mother was scolded for \u201charbouring\u201d her; sharp retorts had ensued from Joan, who had independently offered to leave at once; she had been taken at her word; and here was the result. \u201cI ought never to have come home,\u201d said Tess to herself, bitterly. She was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took note of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the street. Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that he saw her so quickly, and directed his horse so close to the cottage-front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for plants growing under the wall. It was not till he touched the window with his riding-crop that she observed him. The rain had nearly ceased, and she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture. \u201cDidn\u2019t you see me?\u201d asked d\u2019Urberville. \u201cI was not attending,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard you, I believe, though I fancied it was a carriage and horses. I was in a sort of dream.\u201d \u201cAh! you heard the d\u2019Urberville Coach, perhaps. You know the legend, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNo. My\u2014somebody was going to tell it me once, but didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIf you are a genuine d\u2019Urberville I ought not to tell you either, I suppose. As for me, I\u2019m a sham one, so it doesn\u2019t matter. It is rather dismal. It is that this sound of a non-existent coach can only be heard by one of d\u2019Urberville blood, and it is held to be of ill-omen to the one who hears it.", " The lower rooms were entirely given over to the birds, who walked about them with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by themselves, and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east and west in the churchyard. The descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had so much of their affection, had cost so much of their forefathers\u2019 money, and had been in their possession for several generations before the d\u2019Urbervilles came and built here, was indifferently turned into a fowl-house by Mrs Stoke-d\u2019Urberville as soon as the property fell into hand according to law. \u201c\u2019Twas good enough for Christians in grandfather\u2019s time,\u201d they said. The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks. Distracted hens in coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate agriculturists. The chimney-corner and once-blazing hearth was now filled with inverted beehives, in which the hens laid their eggs; while out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had carefully shaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest fashion. The garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall, and could only be entered through a door. When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in altering and improving the arrangements, according to her skilled ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered.", " His own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when, having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d\u2019Urberville family, he had observed Durbeyfield\u2019s name on his waggon, and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject. \u201cAt first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information,\u201d said he. \u201cHowever, our impulses are too strong for our judgement sometimes. I thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while.\u201d \u201cWell, I have heard once or twice, \u2019tis true, that my family had seen better days afore they came to Blackmoor. But I took no notice o\u2019t, thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one. I\u2019ve got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal at home, too; but, Lord, what\u2019s a spoon and seal?... And to think that I and these noble d\u2019Urbervilles were one flesh all the time. \u2019Twas said that my gr\u2019t-granfer had secrets, and didn\u2019t care to talk of where he came from.... And where do we raise our smoke, now, parson, if I may make so bold; I mean, where do we d\u2019Urbervilles live?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t live anywhere. You are extinct\u2014as a county family.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s bad.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male line\u2014that is, gone down\u2014gone under.\u201d \u201cThen where do we lie?\u201d \u201cAt Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill: rows and rows of you in your vaults, with your effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies.\u201d \u201cAnd where be our family mansions and estates?\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t any.\u201d \u201cOh?"], "Where does Tess go to sleep when she can no longer find lodging?": [" Conjecture was useless, and just after twelve o\u2019clock he entered and went to bed. Before putting out his light he re-read Tess\u2019s impassioned letter. Sleep, however, he could not\u2014so near her, yet so far from her\u2014and he continually lifted the window-blind and regarded the backs of the opposite houses, and wondered behind which of the sashes she reposed at that moment. He might almost as well have sat up all night. In the morning he arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of the chief post-office. At the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with letters for the morning delivery. \u201cDo you know the address of a Mrs Clare?\u201d asked Angel. The postman shook his head. Then, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use of her maiden name, Clare said\u2014 \u201cOf a Miss Durbeyfield?\u201d \u201cDurbeyfield?\u201d This also was strange to the postman addressed. \u201cThere\u2019s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cand without the name of the house \u2019tis impossible to find \u2019em.\u201d One of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated to him. \u201cI know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d\u2019Urberville at The Herons,\u201d said the second. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the real pronunciation. \u201cWhat place is The Herons?\u201d \u201cA stylish lodging-house. \u2019Tis all lodging-houses here, bless \u2019ee.\u201d Clare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither, arriving with the milkman.", " Tess was not skilful in the management of a horse, but she thought that she could take upon herself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow Abraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so. She made him a sort of nest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he could not fall, and, taking the reins into her own hands, jogged on as before. Prince required but slight attention, lacking energy for superfluous movements of any sort. With no longer a companion to distract her, Tess fell more deeply into reverie than ever, her back leaning against the hives. The mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges became attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and the occasional heave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul, conterminous with the universe in space, and with history in time. Then, examining the mesh of events in her own life, she seemed to see the vanity of her father\u2019s pride; the gentlemanly suitor awaiting herself in her mother\u2019s fancy; to see him as a grimacing personage, laughing at her poverty and her shrouded knightly ancestry. Everything grew more and more extravagant, and she no longer knew how time passed. A sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and Tess awoke from the sleep into which she, too, had fallen. They were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness, and the waggon had stopped. A hollow groan, unlike anything she had ever heard in her life, came from the front, followed by a shout of \u201cHoi there!\u201d The lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out, but another was shining in her face\u2014much brighter than her own had been.", " Marian, as was the case every afternoon at this time on account of the bottle, began to feel in a romantic vein. \u201cI should not have thought it of him\u2014never!\u201d she said in a dreamy tone. \u201cAnd I loved him so! I didn\u2019t mind his having _you_. But this about Izz is too bad!\u201d Tess, in her start at the words, narrowly missed cutting off a finger with the bill-hook. \u201cIs it about my husband?\u201d she stammered. \u201cWell, yes. Izz said, \u2018Don\u2019t \u2019ee tell her\u2019; but I am sure I can\u2019t help it! It was what he wanted Izz to do. He wanted her to go off to Brazil with him.\u201d Tess\u2019s face faded as white as the scene without, and its curves straightened. \u201cAnd did Izz refuse to go?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Anyhow he changed his mind.\u201d \u201cPooh\u2014then he didn\u2019t mean it! \u2019Twas just a man\u2019s jest!\u201d \u201cYes he did; for he drove her a good-ways towards the station.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t take her!\u201d They pulled on in silence till Tess, without any premonitory symptoms, burst out crying. \u201cThere!\u201d said Marian. \u201cNow I wish I hadn\u2019t told \u2019ee!\u201d \u201cNo. It is a very good thing that you have done! I have been living on in a thirtover, lackaday way, and have not seen what it may lead to! I ought to have sent him a letter oftener. He said I could not go to him, but he didn\u2019t say I was not to write as often as I liked. I won\u2019t dally like this any longer! I have been very wrong and neglectful in leaving everything to be done by him!\u201d The dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and they could see to work no longer.", " \u201cHe was a very splendid lover, no doubt,\u201d she said; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he is a too fond husband to go away from you so soon.\u201d \u201cHe had to go\u2014he was obliged to go, to see about the land over there!\u201d pleaded Tess. \u201cHe might have tided \u2019ee over the winter.\u201d \u201cAh\u2014that\u2019s owing to an accident\u2014a misunderstanding; and we won\u2019t argue it,\u201d Tess answered, with tearfulness in her words. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019s a good deal to be said for him! He did not go away, like some husbands, without telling me; and I can always find out where he is.\u201d After this they continued for some long time in a reverie, as they went on seizing the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering it under their arms, and cutting off the ears with their bill-hooks, nothing sounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the hook. Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon the heap of wheat-ears at her feet. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it!\u201d cried Marian. \u201cIt wants harder flesh than yours for this work.\u201d Just then the farmer entered. \u201cOh, that\u2019s how you get on when I am away,\u201d he said to her. \u201cBut it is my own loss,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cNot yours.\u201d \u201cI want it finished,\u201d he said doggedly, as he crossed the barn and went out at the other door. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2019ee mind him, there\u2019s a dear,\u201d said Marian. \u201cI\u2019ve worked here before.

This was the first time that Clare had ever met her, but he was too preoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman, in the garb of a respectable widow. He was obliged to explain that he was Tess\u2019s husband, and his object in coming there, and he did it awkwardly enough. \u201cI want to see her at once,\u201d he added. \u201cYou said you would write to me again, but you have not done so.\u201d \u201cBecause she\u2019ve not come home,\u201d said Joan. \u201cDo you know if she is well?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t.

Supposing we walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?\u201d Tess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young man was pressing, and she consented to accompany him. He conducted her about the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence to the fruit-garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked strawberries. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess, \u201cwhen they come.\u201d \u201cThey are already here.\u201d D\u2019Urberville began gathering specimens of the fruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and, presently, selecting a specially fine product of the \u201cBritish Queen\u201d variety, he stood up and held it by the stem to her mouth. \u201cNo\u2014no!\u201d she said quickly, putting her fingers between his hand and her lips. \u201cI would rather take it in my own hand.\u201d \u201cNonsense!\u201d he insisted; and in a slight distress she parted her lips and took it in. They had spent some time wandering desultorily thus, Tess eating in a half-pleased, half-reluctant state whatever d\u2019Urberville offered her. When she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled her little basket with them; and then the two passed round to the rose-trees, whence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her bosom. She obeyed like one in a dream, and when she could affix no more he himself tucked a bud or two into her hat, and heaped her basket with others in the prodigality of his bounty.", " \u201cIf you say she ought to go, she will go.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like my children going and making themselves beholden to strange kin,\u201d murmured he. \u201cI\u2019m the head of the noblest branch o\u2019 the family, and I ought to live up to it.\u201d His reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own objections to going. \u201cWell, as I killed the horse, mother,\u201d she said mournfully, \u201cI suppose I ought to do something. I don\u2019t mind going and seeing her, but you must leave it to me about asking for help. And don\u2019t go thinking about her making a match for me\u2014it is silly.\u201d \u201cVery well said, Tess!\u201d observed her father sententiously. \u201cWho said I had such a thought?\u201d asked Joan. \u201cI fancy it is in your mind, mother. But I\u2019ll go.\u201d Rising early next day she walked to the hill-town called Shaston, and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from Shaston eastward to Chaseborough, passing near Trantridge, the parish in which the vague and mysterious Mrs d\u2019Urberville had her residence. Tess Durbeyfield\u2019s route on this memorable morning lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and in which her life had unfolded. The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the world, and its inhabitants the races thereof. From the gates and stiles of Marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering days of infancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than mystery to her now.", " The women\u2014or rather girls, for they were mostly young\u2014wore drawn cotton bonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun, and gloves to prevent their hands being wounded by the stubble. There was one wearing a pale pink jacket, another in a cream-coloured tight-sleeved gown, another in a petticoat as red as the arms of the reaping-machine; and others, older, in the brown-rough \u201cwropper\u201d or over-all\u2014the old-established and most appropriate dress of the field-woman, which the young ones were abandoning. This morning the eye returns involuntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket, she being the most flexuous and finely-drawn figure of them all. But her bonnet is pulled so far over her brow that none of her face is disclosed while she binds, though her complexion may be guessed from a stray twine or two of dark brown hair which extends below the curtain of her bonnet. Perhaps one reason why she seduces casual attention is that she never courts it, though the other women often gaze around them. Her binding proceeds with clock-like monotony. From the sheaf last finished she draws a handful of ears, patting their tips with her left palm to bring them even. Then, stooping low, she moves forward, gathering the corn with both hands against her knees, and pushing her left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side, holding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover."], "What is the landlady\u2019s first clue that Alec has been murdered?": [" When the chants came on, one of her favourites happened to be chosen among the rest\u2014the old double chant \u201cLangdon\u201d\u2014but she did not know what it was called, though she would much have liked to know. She thought, without exactly wording the thought, how strange and god-like was a composer\u2019s power, who from the grave could lead through sequences of emotion, which he alone had felt at first, a girl like her who had never heard of his name, and never would have a clue to his personality. The people who had turned their heads turned them again as the service proceeded; and at last observing her, they whispered to each other. She knew what their whispers were about, grew sick at heart, and felt that she could come to church no more. The bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her retreat more continually than ever. Here, under her few square yards of thatch, she watched winds, and snows, and rains, gorgeous sunsets, and successive moons at their full. So close kept she that at length almost everybody thought she had gone away. The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary. She knew how to hit to a hair\u2019s-breadth that moment of evening when the light and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of day and the suspense of night neutralize each other, leaving absolute mental liberty.", " He did not milk cows because he was obliged to milk cows, but because he was learning to be a rich and prosperous dairyman, landowner, agriculturist, and breeder of cattle. He would become an American or Australian Abraham, commanding like a monarch his flocks and his herds, his spotted and his ring-straked, his men-servants and his maids. At times, nevertheless, it did seem unaccountable to her that a decidedly bookish, musical, thinking young man should have chosen deliberately to be a farmer, and not a clergyman, like his father and brothers. Thus, neither having the clue to the other\u2019s secret, they were respectively puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge of each other\u2019s character and mood without attempting to pry into each other\u2019s history. Every day, every hour, brought to him one more little stroke of her nature, and to her one more of his. Tess was trying to lead a repressed life, but she little divined the strength of her own vitality. At first Tess seemed to regard Angel Clare as an intelligence rather than as a man. As such she compared him with herself; and at every discovery of the abundance of his illuminations, of the distance between her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, Andean altitude of his, she became quite dejected, disheartened from all further effort on her own part whatever. He observed her dejection one day, when he had casually mentioned something to her about pastoral life in ancient Greece.", " She heard Tess re-ascend the stairs to the first floor, and the departure of Clare, and the closing of the front door behind him. Then the door of the room above was shut, and Mrs Brooks knew that Tess had re-entered her apartment. As the young lady was not fully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some time. She accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and stood at the door of the front room\u2014a drawing-room, connected with the room immediately behind it (which was a bedroom) by folding-doors in the common manner. This first floor, containing Mrs Brooks\u2019s best apartments, had been taken by the week by the d\u2019Urbervilles. The back room was now in silence; but from the drawing-room there came sounds. All that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable, continually repeated in a low note of moaning, as if it came from a soul bound to some Ixionian wheel\u2014 \u201cO\u2014O\u2014O!\u201d Then a silence, then a heavy sigh, and again\u2014 \u201cO\u2014O\u2014O!\u201d The landlady looked through the keyhole. Only a small space of the room inside was visible, but within that space came a corner of the breakfast table, which was already spread for the meal, and also a chair beside. Over the seat of the chair Tess\u2019s face was bowed, her posture being a kneeling one in front of it; her hands were clasped over her head, the skirts of her dressing-gown and the embroidery of her night-gown flowed upon the floor behind her, and her stockingless feet, from which the slippers had fallen, protruded upon the carpet.", " \u201cBut let us try further on, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess, what\u2019s the use of your playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!\u201d Accompanied by \u2019Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little lane which secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into the street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. \u201cAh\u2014I\u2019m looking for you!\u201d he said, riding up to them. \u201cThis is indeed a family gathering on the historic spot!\u201d It was Alec d\u2019Urberville. \u201cWhere is Tess?\u201d he asked. Personally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the direction of the church, and went on, d\u2019Urberville saying that he would see them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their search for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone, d\u2019Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot. In the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead, remained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be done to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the churchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall. The door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first time in her life. Within the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the family, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied, altar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their brasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like martin-holes in a sandcliff."], "Where is Tess when she is finally arrested?": [" \u201cOh\u2014that\u2019s all!\u201d said Tess. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t expect her to throw her arms round \u2019ee, an\u2019 to kiss and to coll \u2019ee all at once.\u201d Tess looked out of the window. \u201cI would rather stay here with father and you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather not tell you why, mother; indeed, I don\u2019t quite know why.\u201d A week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search for some light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood. Her idea had been to get together sufficient money during the summer to purchase another horse. Hardly had she crossed the threshold before one of the children danced across the room, saying, \u201cThe gentleman\u2019s been here!\u201d Her mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of her person. Mrs d\u2019Urberville\u2019s son had called on horseback, having been riding by chance in the direction of Marlott. He had wished to know, finally, in the name of his mother, if Tess could really come to manage the old lady\u2019s fowl-farm or not; the lad who had hitherto superintended the birds having proved untrustworthy. \u201cMr d\u2019Urberville says you must be a good girl if you are at all as you appear; he knows you must be worth your weight in gold. He is very much interested in \u2019ee\u2014truth to tell.\u201d Tess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such high opinion from a stranger when, in her own esteem, she had sunk so low. \u201cIt is very good of him to think that,\u201d she murmured; \u201cand if I was quite sure how it would be living there, I would go any-when.\u201d \u201cHe is a mighty handsome man!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Tess coldly.", " In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice. They said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would not object to see her. Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now. He felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents were, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as middle-class people, which it would require some tact to overcome. For though legally at liberty to do as he chose, and though their daughter-in-law\u2019s qualifications could make no practical difference to their lives, in the probability of her living far away from them, he wished for affection\u2019s sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important decision of his life. He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in Tess\u2019s life as if they were vital features. It was for herself that he loved Tess; her soul, her heart, her substance\u2014not for her skill in the dairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for her simple formal faith-professions. Her unsophisticated open-air existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable to him.", " She was expressing in her own native phrases\u2014assisted a little by her Sixth Standard training\u2014feelings which might almost have been called those of the age\u2014the ache of modernism. The perception arrested him less when he reflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in great part but the latest fashion in definition\u2014a more accurate expression, by words in _logy_ and _ism_, of sensations which men and women have vaguely grasped for centuries. Still, it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so young; more than strange; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic. Not guessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him that experience is as to intensity, and not as to duration. Tess\u2019s passing corporeal blight had been her mental harvest. Tess, on her part, could not understand why a man of clerical family and good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a mishap to be alive. For the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very good reason. But how could this admirable and poetic man ever have descended into the Valley of Humiliation, have felt with the man of Uz\u2014as she herself had felt two or three years ago\u2014\u201cMy soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life. I loathe it; I would not live alway.\u201d It was true that he was at present out of his class. But she knew that was only because, like Peter the Great in a shipwright\u2019s yard, he was studying what he wanted to know.", " \u201cBut I fear I do not\u2014\u201d The sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so distressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, and then following with another, she wept outright. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, and wait till I come.\u201d She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and shivered slightly. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot very\u2014a little.\u201d He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down. \u201cYou have only that puffy muslin dress on\u2014how\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my best summer one. \u2019Twas very warm when I started, and I didn\u2019t know I was going to ride, and that it would be night.\u201d \u201cNights grow chilly in September. Let me see.\u201d He pulled off a light overcoat that he had worn, and put it round her tenderly. \u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014now you\u2019ll feel warmer,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, my pretty, rest there; I shall soon be back again.\u201d Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees. She could hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining slope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird, and finally died away. With the setting of the moon the pale light lessened, and Tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had left her. In the meantime Alec d\u2019Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear his genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in."], "Who does Tess hope that Angel will marry?": [" Will you be that woman, Tessy?\u201d He put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an impulse of which his head would disapprove. She turned quite careworn. She had bowed to the inevitable result of proximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her without quite meaning himself to do it so soon. With pain that was like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman. \u201cO Mr Clare\u2014I cannot be your wife\u2014I cannot be!\u201d The sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess\u2019s very heart, and she bowed her face in her grief. \u201cBut, Tess!\u201d he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more greedily close. \u201cDo you say no? Surely you love me?\u201d \u201cO yes, yes! And I would rather be yours than anybody\u2019s in the world,\u201d returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl. \u201cBut I _cannot_ marry you!\u201d \u201cTess,\u201d he said, holding her at arm\u2019s length, \u201cyou are engaged to marry some one else!\u201d \u201cNo, no!\u201d \u201cThen why do you refuse me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry! I have not thought of doing it. I cannot! I only want to love you.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d Driven to subterfuge, she stammered\u2014 \u201cYour father is a parson, and your mother wouldn\u2019 like you to marry such as me. She will want you to marry a lady.\u201d \u201cNonsense\u2014I have spoken to them both. That was partly why I went home.\u201d \u201cI feel I cannot\u2014never, never!\u201d she echoed.", " See what he has given us\u2014all, as we thought, because we were his kin. But if he\u2019s not, it must have been done because of his love for \u2019ee. And yet you\u2019ve not got him to marry!\u201d Get Alec d\u2019Urberville in the mind to marry her! He marry _her_! On matrimony he had never once said a word. And what if he had? How a convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to answer him she could not say. But her poor foolish mother little knew her present feeling towards this man. Perhaps it was unusual in the circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and this, as she had said, was what made her detest herself. She had never wholly cared for him; she did not at all care for him now. She had dreaded him, winced before him, succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her helplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent manners, had been stirred to confused surrender awhile: had suddenly despised and disliked him, and had run away. That was all. Hate him she did not quite; but he was dust and ashes to her, and even for her name\u2019s sake she scarcely wished to marry him. \u201cYou ought to have been more careful if you didn\u2019t mean to get him to make you his wife!\u201d \u201cO mother, my mother!\u201d cried the agonized girl, turning passionately upon her parent as if her poor heart would break. \u201cHow could I be expected to know? I was a child when I left this house four months ago. Why didn\u2019t you tell me there was danger in men-folk?", " A light was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed, awaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts. But she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood. They could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to have. Their condition was objective, contemplative. \u201cHe\u2019s going to marry her!\u201d murmured Retty, never taking eyes off Tess. \u201cHow her face do show it!\u201d \u201cYou _be_ going to marry him?\u201d asked Marian. \u201cYes,\u201d said Tess. \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cSome day.\u201d They thought that this was evasiveness only. \u201c_Yes_\u2014going to _marry_ him\u2014a gentleman!\u201d repeated Izz Huett. And by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another, crept out of their beds, and came and stood barefooted round Tess. Retty put her hands upon Tess\u2019s shoulders, as if to realize her friend\u2019s corporeality after such a miracle, and the other two laid their arms round her waist, all looking into her face. \u201cHow it do seem! Almost more than I can think of!\u201d said Izz Huett. Marian kissed Tess. \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured as she withdrew her lips. \u201cWas that because of love for her, or because other lips have touched there by now?\u201d continued Izz drily to Marian. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking o\u2019 that,\u201d said Marian simply. \u201cI was on\u2019y feeling all the strangeness o\u2019t\u2014that she is to be his wife, and nobody else. I don\u2019t say nay to it, nor either of us, because we did not think of it\u2014only loved him. Still, nobody else is to marry\u2019n in the world\u2014no fine lady, nobody in silks and satins; but she who do live like we.\u201d \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t dislike me for it?\u201d said Tess in a low voice.", " The young children were still above, as was also her father, it being Sunday morning, when he felt justified in lying an additional half-hour. \u201cWell!\u2014my dear Tess!\u201d exclaimed her surprised mother, jumping up and kissing the girl. \u201cHow be ye? I didn\u2019t see you till you was in upon me! Have you come home to be married?\u201d \u201cNo, I have not come for that, mother.\u201d \u201cThen for a holiday?\u201d \u201cYes\u2014for a holiday; for a long holiday,\u201d said Tess. \u201cWhat, isn\u2019t your cousin going to do the handsome thing?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not my cousin, and he\u2019s not going to marry me.\u201d Her mother eyed her narrowly. \u201cCome, you have not told me all,\u201d she said. Then Tess went up to her mother, put her face upon Joan\u2019s neck, and told. \u201cAnd yet th\u2019st not got him to marry \u2019ee!\u201d reiterated her mother. \u201cAny woman would have done it but you, after that!\u201d \u201cPerhaps any woman would except me.\u201d \u201cIt would have been something like a story to come back with, if you had!\u201d continued Mrs Durbeyfield, ready to burst into tears of vexation. \u201cAfter all the talk about you and him which has reached us here, who would have expected it to end like this! Why didn\u2019t ye think of doing some good for your family instead o\u2019 thinking only of yourself? See how I\u2019ve got to teave and slave, and your poor weak father with his heart clogged like a dripping-pan. I did hope for something to come out o\u2019 this! To see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove away together four months ago!"], "What tells Angel and Tess\u2019s sister that Tess has been executed?": [" Tess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her brothers-in-law brought them so nearly behind her back that she could hear every word of their conversation. They said nothing, however, which particularly interested her till, observing the young lady still further in front, one of them remarked, \u201cThere is Mercy Chant. Let us overtake her.\u201d Tess knew the name. It was the woman who had been destined for Angel\u2019s life-companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably would have married but for her intrusive self. She would have known as much without previous information if she had waited a moment, for one of the brothers proceeded to say: \u201cAh! poor Angel, poor Angel! I never see that nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in throwing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever she may be. It is a queer business, apparently. Whether she has joined him yet or not I don\u2019t know; but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from him.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say. He never tells me anything nowadays. His ill-considered marriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was begun by his extraordinary opinions.\u201d Tess beat up the long hill still faster; but she could not outwalk them without exciting notice. At last they outsped her altogether, and passed her by. The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps and turned. Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands, and the three went on together.", " It seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two; and I wish there were not\u2014except \u2019Liza-Lu.\u201d Clare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little lighter, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and sat down by her side. \u201cAngel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over \u2019Liza-Lu for my sake?\u201d she asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind among the pillars. \u201cI will.\u201d \u201cShe is so good and simple and pure. O, Angel\u2014I wish you would marry her if you lose me, as you will do shortly. O, if you would!\u201d \u201cIf I lose you I lose all! And she is my sister-in-law.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, dearest. People marry sister-laws continually about Marlott; and \u2019Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she is growing so beautiful. O, I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits! If you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her up for your own self!... She had all the best of me without the bad of me; and if she were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not divided us... Well, I have said it. I won\u2019t mention it again.\u201d She ceased, and he fell into thought. In the far north-east sky he could see between the pillars a level streak of light. The uniform concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot, letting in at the earth\u2019s edge the coming day, against which the towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined.", " She had come from the manor-house. \u201cMrs d\u2019Urberville wants the fowls as usual,\u201d she said; but perceiving that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, \u201cMis\u2019ess is a old lady, and blind.\u201d \u201cBlind!\u201d said Tess. Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took, under her companion\u2019s direction, two of the most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures\u2014feathers floating within view of the front, and hen-coops standing on the grass. In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a white-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a large cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges\u2014one sitting on each arm. \u201cAh, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?\u201d said Mrs d\u2019Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. \u201cI hope you will be kind to them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person.", " Her sister, whom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child, had sprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation, of which as yet Lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning. Her thin legs, visible below her once-long frock, now short by her growing, and her uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her youth and inexperience. \u201cYes, I have been traipsing about all day, Tess,\u201d said Lu, with unemotional gravity, \u201ca-trying to find \u2019ee; and I\u2019m very tired.\u201d \u201cWhat is the matter at home?\u201d \u201cMother is took very bad, and the doctor says she\u2019s dying, and as father is not very well neither, and says \u2019tis wrong for a man of such a high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring work, we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Tess stood in reverie a long time before she thought of asking \u2019Liza-Lu to come in and sit down. When she had done so, and \u2019Liza-Lu was having some tea, she came to a decision. It was imperative that she should go home. Her agreement did not end till Old Lady-Day, the sixth of April, but as the interval thereto was not a long one she resolved to run the risk of starting at once. To go that night would be a gain of twelve-hours; but her sister was too tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow.
