Yes; and I told the officer who was searching for you that you were not present. BLUNTSCHLI. True. I should have remembered it. RAINA (greatly encouraged). Ah, it is natural that you should forget it first. It cost you nothing: it cost me a lie!--a lie!! (She sits down on the ottoman, looking straight before her with her hands clasped on her knee. Bluntschli, quite touched, goes to the ottoman with a particularly reassuring and considerate air, and sits down beside her.) BLUNTSCHLI. My dear young lady, don't let this worry you.

The \"twins\" illustrate the disconcerting effects of that perfect frankness which would make life intolerable. Gloria demonstrates the powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts. The idea that parental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such knowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned. Crampton, the father, typifies the common superstition that among the privileges of parenthood are inflexibility, tyranny, and respect, the last entirely regardless of whether it has been deserved. The waiter, William, is the best illustration of the man \"who knows his place\" that the stage has seen. He is the most pathetic figure of the play.", " (He sits down on the ottoman, and takes his head in his hands.) Would you like to see me cry? RAINA (quickly). No. MAN.

I won't scold you. (Touched by the sympathy in her tone, he raises his head and looks gratefully at her: she immediately draws back and says stiffly) You must excuse me: our soldiers are not like that. (She moves away from the ottoman.) MAN. Oh, yes, they are. There are only two sorts of soldiers: old ones and young ones. I've served fourteen years: half of your fellows never smelt powder before. Why, how is it that you've just beaten us? Sheer ignorance of the art of war, nothing else. (Indignantly.) I never saw anything so unprofessional. RAINA (ironically).

This notion pervades society to such an extent that when we find some soldiers placed upon the stage acting rationally, our conventionalized senses are shocked.

Never you mind my soul; but just listen to my advice. If you want to be a lady, your present behaviour to me won't do at all, unless when we're alone.

The man immediately steps out from behind the curtain, sheathing his sabre, and dismissing the danger from his mind in a businesslike way.) MAN. A narrow shave; but a miss is as good as a mile. Dear young lady, your servant until death. I wish for your sake I had joined the Bulgarian army instead of the Servian. I am not a native Servian. RAINA (haughtily). No, you are one of the Austrians who set the Servians on to rob us of our national liberty, and who officer their army for them. We hate them! MAN. Austrian! not I. Don't hate me, dear young lady. I am only a Swiss, fighting merely as a professional soldier. I joined Servia because it was nearest to me.", " Egad, there'd have been no war without them. RAINA. Are there many Swiss officers in the Servian Army? PETKOFF. No--all Austrians, just as our officers were all Russians. This was the only Swiss I came across. I'll never trust a Swiss again. He cheated us--humbugged us into giving him fifty able bodied men for two hundred confounded worn out chargers. They weren't even eatable! SERGIUS. We were two children in the hands of that consummate soldier, Major: simply two innocent little children. RAINA. What was he like? CATHERINE. Oh, Raina, what a silly question! SERGIUS. He was like a commercial traveller in uniform. Bourgeois to his boots. PETKOFF (grinning). Sergius: tell Catherine that queer story his friend told us about him--how he escaped after Slivnitza. You remember?--about his being hid by two women. SERGIUS (with bitter irony). Oh, yes, quite a romance. He was serving in the very battery I so unprofessionally charged.", " (He goes towards the house.) Come along. (Sergius is about to follow him when Catherine rises and intervenes.) CATHERINE.

PETKOFF. What, that Swiss fellow? Sergius: I've often thought of that exchange since. He over-reached us about those horses. SERGIUS. Of course he over-reached us. His father was a hotel and livery stable keeper; and he owed his first step to his knowledge of horse-dealing. (With mock enthusiasm.) Ah, he was a soldier--every inch a soldier! If only I had bought the horses for my regiment instead of foolishly leading it into danger, I should have been a field-marshal now! CATHERINE. A Swiss? What was he doing in the Servian army?

I hope you behaved yourself before all those Russian officers. PETKOFF. I did my best. I took care to let them know that we had a library. CATHERINE. Ah; but you didn't tell them that we have an electric bell in it? I have had one put up. PETKOFF. What's an electric bell? CATHERINE. You touch a button; something tinkles in the kitchen; and then Nicola comes up. PETKOFF. Why not shout for him? CATHERINE. Civilized people never shout for their servants. I've learnt that while you were away. PETKOFF. Well, I'll tell you something I've learnt, too.

There's only one thing I want to make me thoroughly comfortable. CATHERINE. What is that? PETKOFF. My old coat. I'm not at home in this one: I feel as if I were on parade. CATHERINE. My dear Paul, how absurd you are about that old coat! It must be hanging in the blue closet where you left it. PETKOFF. My dear Catherine, I tell you I've looked there. Am I to believe my own eyes or not? (Catherine quietly rises and presses the button of the electric bell by the fireplace.) What are you shewing off that bell for?

And there shall be no mistake about the cartridges this time. SERGIUS (flushing, but with deadly coldness). Take care, sir. It is not our custom in Bulgaria to allow invitations of that kind to be trifled with. BLUNTSCHLI (warmly). Pooh! don't talk to me about Bulgaria. You don't know what fighting is. But have it your own way. Bring your sabre along. I'll meet you. SERGIUS (fiercely delighted to find his opponent a man of spirit). Well said, Switzer. Shall I lend you my best horse? BLUNTSCHLI. No: damn your horse!---thank you all the same, my dear fellow. (Raina comes in, and hears the next sentence.) I shall fight you on foot.

You will leave me your address. BLUNTSCHLI. True. Allow me. (He takes out his card-case, and stops to write his address, keeping Catherine in an agony of impatience.

Oh Heavens! (She sinks on the seat against the wall.) PETKOFF (too preoccupied to notice her as he shakes Bluntschli's hand heartily).

He's got out of hand while I was away. I'll teach him. (Recollecting his guest.) Oh, well, never mind. Come, Bluntschli, lets have no more nonsense about you having to go away. You know very well you're not going back to Switzerland yet. Until you do go back you'll stay with us. RAINA. Oh, do, Captain Bluntschli. PETKOFF (to Catherine). Now, Catherine, it's of you that he's afraid. Press him and he'll stay. CATHERINE. Of course I shall be only too delighted if (appealingly) Captain Bluntschli really wishes to stay.

I always carry chocolate instead; and I finished the last cake of that yesterday. RAINA (outraged in her most cherished ideals of manhood). Chocolate!

In \"Arms and the Man\" the subject which occupies the dramatist's attention is that survival of barbarity--militarism--which raises its horrid head from time to time to cast a doubt on the reality of our civilization. No more hoary superstition survives than that the donning of a uniform changes the nature of the wearer. This notion pervades society to such an extent that when we find some soldiers placed upon the stage acting rationally, our conventionalized senses are shocked. The only men who have no illusions about war are those who have recently been there, and, of course, Mr. Shaw, who has no illusions about anything. It is hard to speak too highly of \"Candida.\" No equally subtle and incisive study of domestic relations exists in the English drama. One has to turn to George Meredith's \"The Egoist\" to find such character dissection. The central note of the play is, that with the true woman, weakness which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful than strength which offers protection."]}
