RAINA (rushing to him). Stop! (She catches him by the shoulder, and turns him quite round.) They'll kill you. MAN (coolly, but attentively). Never mind: this sort of thing is all in my day's work. I'm bound to take my chance. (Decisively.) Now do what I tell you. Put out the candles, so that they shan't see the light when I open the shutters. And keep away from the window, whatever you do. If they see me, they're sure to have a shot at me. RAINA (clinging to him). They're sure to see you: it's bright moonlight. I'll save you--oh, how can you be so indifferent? You want me to save you, don't you? MAN. I really don't want to be troublesome. (She shakes him in her impatience.) I am not indifferent, dear young lady, I assure you. But how is it to be done? RAINA. Come away from the window--please. (She coaxes him back to the middle of the room. He submits humbly. She releases him, and addresses him patronizingly.) Now listen. You must trust to our hospitality. You do not yet know in whose house you are. I am a Petkoff. MAN. What's that? RAINA (rather indignantly). I mean that I belong to the family of the Petkoffs, the richest and best known in our country. MAN. Oh, yes, of course. I beg your pardon. The Petkoffs, to be sure. How stupid of me! RAINA. You know you never heard of them until this minute.", " In the garden of major Petkoff's house. It is a fine spring morning; and the garden looks fresh and pretty. Beyond the paling the tops of a couple of minarets can be seen, shewing that there is a valley there, with the little town in it. A few miles further the Balkan mountains rise and shut in the view. Within the garden the side of the house is seen on the right, with a garden door reached by a little flight of steps. On the left the stable yard, with its gateway, encroaches on the garden. There are fruit bushes along the paling and house, covered with washing hung out to dry. A path runs by the house, and rises by two steps at the corner where it turns out of the right along the front. In the middle a small table, with two bent wood chairs at it, is laid for breakfast with Turkish coffee pot, cups, rolls, etc. ; but the cups have been used and the bread broken. There is a wooden garden seat against the wall on the left. Louka, smoking a cigaret, is standing between the table and the house, turning her back with angry disdain on a man-servant who is lecturing her. He is a middle-aged man of cool temperament and low but clear and keen intelligence, with the complacency of the servant who values himself on his rank in servility, and the imperturbability of the accurate calculator who has no illusions. He wears a white Bulgarian costume jacket with decorated border, sash, wide knickerbockers, and decorated gaiters.", " I have put everything right, I hope, gracious young lady! RAINA (in uncontrollable vexation). I quite agree with your account of yourself. You are a romantic idiot. (Bluntschli is unspeakably taken aback.) Next time I hope you will know the difference between a schoolgirl of seventeen and a woman of twenty-three. BLUNTSCHLI (stupefied). Twenty-three! (She snaps the photograph contemptuously from his hand; tears it across; and throws the pieces at his feet.) SERGIUS (with grim enjoyment of Bluntschli's discomfiture). Bluntschli: my one last belief is gone. Your sagacity is a fraud, like all the other things. You have less sense than even I have. BLUNTSCHLI (overwhelmed). Twenty-three! Twenty-three!! (He considers.) Hm! (Swiftly making up his mind.) In that case, Major Petkoff, I beg to propose formally to become a suitor for your daughter's hand, in place of Major Saranoff retired. RAINA. You dare! BLUNTSCHLI. If you were twenty-three when you said those things to me this afternoon, I shall take them seriously. CATHERINE (loftily polite). I doubt, sir, whether you quite realize either my daughter's position or that of Major Sergius Saranoff, whose place you propose to take. The Petkoffs and the Saranoffs are known as the richest and most important families in the country. Our position is almost historical: we can go back for nearly twenty years. PETKOFF. Oh, never mind that, Catherine.", " (Louka appears at the door of the house, announcing \"Captain Bluntschli;\" and standing aside at the top of the steps to let him pass before she goes in again. He is the man of the adventure in Raina's room. He is now clean, well brushed, smartly uniformed, and out of trouble, but still unmistakably the same man. The moment Louka's back is turned, Catherine swoops on him with hurried, urgent, coaxing appeal.) Captain Bluntschli, I am very glad to see you; but you must leave this house at once. (He raises his eyebrows.) My husband has just returned, with my future son-in-law; and they know nothing. If they did, the consequences would be terrible. You are a foreigner: you do not feel our national animosities as we do. We still hate the Servians: the only effect of the peace on my husband is to make him feel like a lion baulked of his prey. If he discovered our secret, he would never forgive me; and my daughter's life would hardly be safe. Will you, like the chivalrous gentleman and soldier you are, leave at once before he finds you here? BLUNTSCHLI (disappointed, but philosophical). At once, gracious lady. I only came to thank you and return the coat you lent me. If you will allow me to take it out of my bag and leave it with your servant as I pass out, I need detain you no further. (He turns to go into the house.) CATHERINE (catching him by the sleeve). Oh, you must not think of going back that way."], "Raina\u2019s father holds what rank in the Bulgarian army?": [" How can you stoop to pretend? MAN. Forgive me: I'm too tired to think; and the change of subject was too much for me. Don't scold me. RAINA. I forgot. It might make you cry. (He nods, quite seriously. She pouts and then resumes her patronizing tone.) I must tell you that my father holds the highest command of any Bulgarian in our army. He is (proudly) a Major. MAN (pretending to be deeply impressed). A Major! Bless me! Think of that! RAINA. You shewed great ignorance in thinking that it was necessary to climb up to the balcony, because ours is the only private house that has two rows of windows. There is a flight of stairs inside to get up and down by. MAN. Stairs! How grand! You live in great luxury indeed, dear young lady. RAINA. Do you know what a library is? MAN. A library? A roomful of books. RAINA. Yes, we have one, the only one in Bulgaria. MAN. Actually a real library! I should like to see that. RAINA (affectedly). I tell you these things to shew you that you are not in the house of ignorant country folk who would kill you the moment they saw your Servian uniform, but among civilized people. We go to Bucharest every year for the opera season; and I have spent a whole month in Vienna. MAN. I saw that, dear young lady. I saw at once that you knew the world. RAINA. Have you ever seen the opera of Ernani? MAN. Is that the one with the devil in it in red velvet, and a soldier's chorus?", " (Politely.) Gracious lady, a thousand pardons. Good-night.

Don't leave my mother, Louka, whilst the soldiers are here. (Louka glances at Raina, at the ottoman, at the curtain; then purses her lips secretively, laughs to herself, and goes out. Raina follows her to the door, shuts it behind her with a slam, and locks it violently. The man immediately steps out from behind the curtain, sheathing his sabre, and dismissing the danger from his mind in a businesslike way.) MAN. A narrow shave; but a miss is as good as a mile. Dear young lady, your servant until death. I wish for your sake I had joined the Bulgarian army instead of the Servian. I am not a native Servian. RAINA (haughtily). No, you are one of the Austrians who set the Servians on to rob us of our national liberty, and who officer their army for them. We hate them! MAN. Austrian! not I. Don't hate me, dear young lady. I am only a Swiss, fighting merely as a professional soldier. I joined Servia because it was nearest to me. Be generous: you've beaten us hollow. RAINA. Have I not been generous? MAN. Noble!--heroic! But I'm not saved yet. This particular rush will soon pass through; but the pursuit will go on all night by fits and starts.", " Ah! (She throws the cloak on the ottoman, and comes eagerly to Catherine in her nightgown, a pretty garment, but evidently the only one she has on.) CATHERINE. A great battle at Slivnitza! A victory! And it was won by Sergius. RAINA (with a cry of delight). Ah! (Rapturously.) Oh, mother! (Then, with sudden anxiety) Is father safe? CATHERINE. Of course: he sent me the news. Sergius is the hero of the hour, the idol of the regiment. RAINA. Tell me, tell me. How was it! (Ecstatically) Oh, mother, mother, mother! (Raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman; and they kiss one another frantically.) CATHERINE (with surging enthusiasm). You can't guess how splendid it is. A cavalry charge--think of that! He defied our Russian commanders--acted without orders--led a charge on his own responsibility--headed it himself--was the first man to sweep through their guns. Can't you see it, Raina; our gallant splendid Bulgarians with their swords and eyes flashing, thundering down like an avalanche and scattering the wretched Servian dandies like chaff. And you--you kept Sergius waiting a year before you would be betrothed to him. Oh, if you have a drop of Bulgarian blood in your veins, you will worship him when he comes back. RAINA. What will he care for my poor little worship after the acclamations of a whole army of heroes? But no matter: I am so happy--so proud! (She rises and walks about excitedly.)", " RAINA (contemptuously). No! MAN (stifling a heavy sigh of weariness). Then I don't know it. RAINA. I thought you might have remembered the great scene where Ernani, flying from his foes just as you are tonight, takes refuge in the castle of his bitterest enemy, an old Castilian noble. The noble refuses to give him up. His guest is sacred to him. MAN (quickly waking up a little). Have your people got that notion? RAINA (with dignity). My mother and I can understand that notion, as you call it. And if instead of threatening me with your pistol as you did, you had simply thrown yourself as a fugitive on our hospitality, you would have been as safe as in your father's house. MAN. Quite sure? RAINA (turning her back on him in disgust.) Oh, it is useless to try and make you understand. MAN. Don't be angry: you see how awkward it would be for me if there was any mistake. My father is a very hospitable man: he keeps six hotels; but I couldn't trust him as far as that. What about YOUR father? RAINA. He is away at Slivnitza fighting for his country. I answer for your safety. There is my hand in pledge of it. Will that reassure you? (She offers him her hand.) MAN (looking dubiously at his own hand). Better not touch my hand, dear young lady. I must have a wash first. RAINA (touched). That is very nice of you. I see that you are a gentleman. MAN (puzzled). Eh? RAINA. You must not think I am surprised."], "What does Louka tell Raina in the opening scene of the play?": [" SERGIUS. Be quick. If you are away five minutes, it will seem five hours. (Raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there to exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands. He looks after her with emotion for a moment, then turns slowly away, his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which has just passed. The movement shifts his field of vision, into the corner of which there now comes the tail of Louka's double apron. His eye gleams at once. He takes a stealthy look at her, and begins to twirl his moustache nervously, with his left hand akimbo on his hip. Finally, striking the ground with his heels in something of a cavalry swagger, he strolls over to the left of the table, opposite her, and says) Louka: do you know what the higher love is? LOUKA (astonished). No, sir. SERGIUS. Very fatiguing thing to keep up for any length of time, Louka. One feels the need of some relief after it. LOUKA (innocently). Perhaps you would like some coffee, sir? (She stretches her hand across the table for the coffee pot.) SERGIUS (taking her hand). Thank you, Louka. LOUKA (pretending to pull). Oh, sir, you know I didn't mean that. I'm surprised at you! SERGIUS (coming clear of the table and drawing her with him). I am surprised at myself, Louka. What would Sergius, the hero of Slivnitza, say if he saw me now? What would Sergius, the apostle of the higher love, say if he saw me now?", " SERGIUS (recoiling a step). Louka! LOUKA. It shews how little you really care! SERGIUS (dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing politeness). If our conversation is to continue, Louka, you will please remember that a gentleman does not discuss the conduct of the lady he is engaged to with her maid. LOUKA. It's so hard to know what a gentleman considers right. I thought from your trying to kiss me that you had given up being so particular. SERGIUS (turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes back into the garden from the gateway). Devil! devil! LOUKA. Ha! ha! I expect one of the six of you is very like me, sir, though I am only Miss Raina's maid. (She goes back to her work at the table, taking no further notice of him.) SERGIUS (speaking to himself). Which of the six is the real man?--that's the question that torments me. One of them is a hero, another a buffoon, another a humbug, another perhaps a bit of a blackguard. (He pauses and looks furtively at Louka, as he adds with deep bitterness) And one, at least, is a coward--jealous, like all cowards. (He goes to the table.) Louka. LOUKA. Yes? SERGIUS. Who is my rival? LOUKA. You shall never get that out of me, for love or money. SERGIUS. Why? LOUKA. Never mind why. Besides, you would tell that I told you; and I should lose my place.

RAINA (gazing thoughtfully at the gravel as she walks). The little beast! CATHERINE. Little beast! What little beast? RAINA. To go and tell! Oh, if I had him here, I'd stuff him with chocolate creams till he couldn't ever speak again! CATHERINE. Don't talk nonsense. Tell me the truth, Raina. How long was he in your room before you came to me? RAINA (whisking round and recommencing her march in the opposite direction). Oh, I forget. CATHERINE. You cannot forget! Did he really climb up after the soldiers were gone, or was he there when that officer searched the room? RAINA. No. Yes, I think he must have been there then. CATHERINE. You think! Oh, Raina, Raina! Will anything ever make you straightforward? If Sergius finds out, it is all over between you. RAINA (with cool impertinence). Oh, I know Sergius is your pet. I sometimes wish you could marry him instead of me. You would just suit him. You would pet him, and spoil him, and mother him to perfection. CATHERINE (opening her eyes very widely indeed). Well, upon my word! RAINA (capriciously--half to herself).

Louka goes into the house.) CATHERINE. My dear Paul, what a surprise for us. (She stoops over the back of his chair to kiss him.) Have they brought you fresh coffee? PETKOFF. Yes, Louka's been looking after me. The war's over. The treaty was signed three days ago at Bucharest; and the decree for our army to demobilize was issued yesterday.

That comes from washing your neck every day. I've often told you so. CATHERINE. Nonsense, Paul! PETKOFF (over his coffee and cigaret). I don't believe in going too far with these modern customs. All this washing can't be good for the health: it's not natural. There was an Englishman at Phillipopolis who used to wet himself all over with cold water every morning when he got up. Disgusting! It all comes from the English: their climate makes them so dirty that they have to be perpetually washing themselves. Look at my father: he never had a bath in his life; and he lived to be ninety-eight, the healthiest man in Bulgaria. I don't mind a good wash once a week to keep up my position; but once a day is carrying the thing to a ridiculous extreme. CATHERINE. You are a barbarian at heart still, Paul.

Did you get back safely that morning? BLUNTSCHLI. Quite, thanks. RAINA. Were they angry with you for running away from Sergius's charge? BLUNTSCHLI. No, they were glad; because they'd all just run away themselves. RAINA (going to the table, and leaning over it towards him). It must have made a lovely story for them--all that about me and my room. BLUNTSCHLI. Capital story. But I only told it to one of them--a particular friend. RAINA. On whose discretion you could absolutely rely? BLUNTSCHLI. Absolutely. RAINA. Hm!

You have enjoyed the privilege of being received in her own room, late at night-- BLUNTSCHLI (interrupting him pepperily). Yes; you blockhead! She received me with a pistol at her head. Your cavalry were at my heels. I'd have blown out her brains if she'd uttered a cry. SERGIUS (taken aback). Bluntschli! Raina: is this true? RAINA (rising in wrathful majesty). Oh, how dare you, how dare you? BLUNTSCHLI. Apologize, man, apologize! (He resumes his seat at the table.) SERGIUS (with the old measured emphasis, folding his arms). I never apologize.

No: he's dead--burnt alive. RAINA (stopping, shocked). Burnt alive! BLUNTSCHLI. Shot in the hip in a wood yard. Couldn't drag himself out. Your fellows' shells set the timber on fire and burnt him, with half a dozen other poor devils in the same predicament. RAINA. How horrible! SERGIUS. And how ridiculous!

You say that before me."], "The play might not be described as of which subgenre?": [" Candida is quite unpoetic, as, indeed, with rare exceptions, women are prone to be. They have small delight in poetry, but are the stuff of which poems and dreams are made. The husband glorying in his strength but convicted of his weakness, the poet pitiful in his physical impotence but strong in his perception of truth, the hopelessly de-moralized manufacturer, the conventional and hence emotional typist make up a group which the drama of any language may be challenged to rival. In \"The Man of Destiny\" the object of the dramatist is not so much the destruction as the explanation of the Napoleonic tradition, which has so powerfully influenced generation after generation for a century. However the man may be regarded, he was a miracle. Shaw shows that he achieved his extraordinary career by suspending, for himself, the pressure of the moral and conventional atmosphere, while leaving it operative for others. Those who study this play--extravaganza, that it is--will attain a clearer comprehension of Napoleon than they can get from all the biographies. \"You Never Can Tell\" offers an amusing study of the play of social conventions. The \"twins\" illustrate the disconcerting effects of that perfect frankness which would make life intolerable. Gloria demonstrates the powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts. The idea that parental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such knowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned.", " It proves that all our ideas were real after all. CATHERINE (indignantly). Our ideas real! What do you mean? RAINA. Our ideas of what Sergius would do--our patriotism--our heroic ideals. Oh, what faithless little creatures girls are!--I sometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams. When I buckled on Sergius's sword he looked so noble: it was treason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure. And yet--and yet--(Quickly.) Promise me you'll never tell him. CATHERINE. Don't ask me for promises until I know what I am promising. RAINA. Well, it came into my head just as he was holding me in his arms and looking into my eyes, that perhaps we only had our heroic ideas because we are so fond of reading Byron and Pushkin, and because we were so delighted with the opera that season at Bucharest. Real life is so seldom like that--indeed never, as far as I knew it then. (Remorsefully.) Only think, mother, I doubted him: I wondered whether all his heroic qualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination when he went into a real battle. I had an uneasy fear that he might cut a poor figure there beside all those clever Russian officers. CATHERINE. A poor figure! Shame on you! The Servians have Austrian officers who are just as clever as our Russians; but we have beaten them in every battle for all that. RAINA (laughing and sitting down again). Yes, I was only a prosaic little coward.", " If I were in camp now they'd play all sorts of tricks on me. RAINA (a little moved). I'm sorry. I won't scold you.

(She moves away from the ottoman.) MAN. Oh, yes, they are. There are only two sorts of soldiers: old ones and young ones. I've served fourteen years: half of your fellows never smelt powder before. Why, how is it that you've just beaten us? Sheer ignorance of the art of war, nothing else. (Indignantly.) I never saw anything so unprofessional. RAINA (ironically). Oh, was it unprofessional to beat you? MAN. Well, come, is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of machine guns, with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire? I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. RAINA (eagerly turning to him, as all her enthusiasm and her dream of glory rush back on her). Did you see the great cavalry charge? Oh, tell me about it. Describe it to me. MAN. You never saw a cavalry charge, did you? RAINA. How could I? MAN. Ah, perhaps not--of course. Well, it's a funny sight.

RAINA. Are there many Swiss officers in the Servian Army? PETKOFF. No--all Austrians, just as our officers were all Russians. This was the only Swiss I came across. I'll never trust a Swiss again. He cheated us--humbugged us into giving him fifty able bodied men for two hundred confounded worn out chargers. They weren't even eatable! SERGIUS.

BLUNTSCHLI (imperturbably).", " That's what I would have done. PETKOFF. I don't doubt it in the least, my dear. But I should have had to subdue the whole Austrian Empire first; and that would have kept me too long away from you. I missed you greatly. CATHERINE (relenting). Ah! (Stretches her hand affectionately across the table to squeeze his.) PETKOFF. And how have you been, my dear? CATHERINE. Oh, my usual sore throats, that's all. PETKOFF (with conviction). That comes from washing your neck every day. I've often told you so. CATHERINE. Nonsense, Paul! PETKOFF (over his coffee and cigaret). I don't believe in going too far with these modern customs. All this washing can't be good for the health: it's not natural. There was an Englishman at Phillipopolis who used to wet himself all over with cold water every morning when he got up. Disgusting! It all comes from the English: their climate makes them so dirty that they have to be perpetually washing themselves. Look at my father: he never had a bath in his life; and he lived to be ninety-eight, the healthiest man in Bulgaria. I don't mind a good wash once a week to keep up my position; but once a day is carrying the thing to a ridiculous extreme. CATHERINE. You are a barbarian at heart still, Paul. I hope you behaved yourself before all those Russian officers. PETKOFF. I did my best. I took care to let them know that we had a library. CATHERINE. Ah; but you didn't tell them that we have an electric bell in it?", " PETKOFF. Stuff and nonsense, Sergius. That's quite enough fuss about nothing: a soldier's daughter should be able to stand up without flinching to a little strong conversation. (He rises.) Come: it's time for us to get to business. We have to make up our minds how those three regiments are to get back to Phillipopolis:--there's no forage for them on the Sofia route. (He goes towards the house.) Come along. (Sergius is about to follow him when Catherine rises and intervenes.) CATHERINE. Oh, Paul, can't you spare Sergius for a few moments? Raina has hardly seen him yet. Perhaps I can help you to settle about the regiments. SERGIUS (protesting). My dear madam, impossible: you-- CATHERINE (stopping him playfully). You stay here, my dear Sergius: there's no hurry. I have a word or two to say to Paul. (Sergius instantly bows and steps back.) Now, dear (taking Petkoff's arm), come and see the electric bell. PETKOFF. Oh, very well, very well. (They go into the house together affectionately. Sergius, left alone with Raina, looks anxiously at her, fearing that she may be still offended. She smiles, and stretches out her arms to him.)

(Towering over Bluntschli, he puts his hand on his shoulder and takes him to the steps, Petkoff following. As Bluntschli puts his foot on the first step, Raina comes out of the house.) RAINA (completely losing her presence of mind). Oh, the chocolate cream soldier! (Bluntschli stands rigid. Sergius, amazed, looks at Raina, then at Petkoff, who looks back at him and then at his wife.) CATHERINE (with commanding presence of mind). My dear Raina, don't you see that we have a guest here--Captain Bluntschli, one of our new Servian friends? (Raina bows; Bluntschli bows.) RAINA. How silly of me! (She comes down into the centre of the group, between Bluntschli and Petkoff) I made a beautiful ornament this morning for the ice pudding; and that stupid Nicola has just put down a pile of plates on it and spoiled it. (To Bluntschli, winningly.) I hope you didn't think that you were the chocolate cream soldier, Captain Bluntschli. BLUNTSCHLI (laughing). I assure you I did. (Stealing a whimsical glance at her.) Your explanation was a relief. PETKOFF (suspiciously, to Raina). And since when, pray, have you taken to cooking? CATHERINE.", " And you shall wait my pleasure. (Bluntschli, much preoccupied, with his papers still in his hand, enters, leaving the door open for Louka to go out. He goes across to the table, glancing at her as he passes. Sergius, without altering his resolute attitude, watches him steadily. Louka goes out, leaving the door open.) BLUNTSCHLI (absently, sitting at the table as before, and putting down his papers). That's a remarkable looking young woman. SERGIUS (gravely, without moving). Captain Bluntschli. BLUNTSCHLI. Eh? SERGIUS. You have deceived me. You are my rival. I brook no rivals. At six o'clock I shall be in the drilling-ground on the Klissoura road, alone, on horseback, with my sabre. Do you understand? BLUNTSCHLI (staring, but sitting quite at his ease). Oh, thank you: that's a cavalry man's proposal. I'm in the artillery; and I have the choice of weapons. If I go, I shall take a machine gun. And there shall be no mistake about the cartridges this time. SERGIUS (flushing, but with deadly coldness). Take care, sir. It is not our custom in Bulgaria to allow invitations of that kind to be trifled with. BLUNTSCHLI (warmly). Pooh! don't talk to me about Bulgaria. You don't know what fighting is. But have it your own way. Bring your sabre along. I'll meet you. SERGIUS (fiercely delighted to find his opponent a man of spirit). Well said, Switzer. Shall I lend you my best horse? BLUNTSCHLI.", " By the bye, Catherine, you may as well come, too. They'll be far more frightened of you than of me. CATHERINE (putting down her embroidery). I daresay I had better. You will only splutter at them. (She goes out, Petkoff holding the door for her and following her.) BLUNTSCHLI. What a country! They make cannons out of cherry trees; and the officers send for their wives to keep discipline! (He begins to fold and docket the papers. Raina, who has risen from the divan, strolls down the room with her hands clasped behind her, and looks mischievously at him.) RAINA. You look ever so much nicer than when we last met. (He looks up, surprised.) What have you done to yourself? BLUNTSCHLI. Washed; brushed; good night's sleep and breakfast. That's all. RAINA. Did you get back safely that morning? BLUNTSCHLI. Quite, thanks. RAINA. Were they angry with you for running away from Sergius's charge? BLUNTSCHLI. No, they were glad; because they'd all just run away themselves. RAINA (going to the table, and leaning over it towards him). It must have made a lovely story for them--all that about me and my room. BLUNTSCHLI. Capital story. But I only told it to one of them--a particular friend. RAINA. On whose discretion you could absolutely rely? BLUNTSCHLI. Absolutely. RAINA. Hm! He told it all to my father and Sergius the day you exchanged the prisoners. (She turns away and strolls carelessly across to the other side of the room.)", " RAINA (superbly). Captain Bluntschli!

BLUNTSCHLI. Ah, I see. You wrote something on it. That was rash! RAINA (annoyed almost to tears)."], "The play is written in which form?": [" Candida is quite unpoetic, as, indeed, with rare exceptions, women are prone to be. They have small delight in poetry, but are the stuff of which poems and dreams are made. The husband glorying in his strength but convicted of his weakness, the poet pitiful in his physical impotence but strong in his perception of truth, the hopelessly de-moralized manufacturer, the conventional and hence emotional typist make up a group which the drama of any language may be challenged to rival. In \"The Man of Destiny\" the object of the dramatist is not so much the destruction as the explanation of the Napoleonic tradition, which has so powerfully influenced generation after generation for a century. However the man may be regarded, he was a miracle. Shaw shows that he achieved his extraordinary career by suspending, for himself, the pressure of the moral and conventional atmosphere, while leaving it operative for others. Those who study this play--extravaganza, that it is--will attain a clearer comprehension of Napoleon than they can get from all the biographies. \"You Never Can Tell\" offers an amusing study of the play of social conventions. The \"twins\" illustrate the disconcerting effects of that perfect frankness which would make life intolerable. Gloria demonstrates the powerlessness of reason to overcome natural instincts. The idea that parental duties and functions can be fulfilled by the light of such knowledge as man and woman attain by intuition is brilliantly lampooned.", " Excuse me, Bluntschli: what did you say had spoiled your chances in life? BLUNTSCHLI (promptly). An incurably romantic disposition. I ran away from home twice when I was a boy. I went into the army instead of into my father's business. I climbed the balcony of this house when a man of sense would have dived into the nearest cellar. I came sneaking back here to have another look at the young lady when any other man of my age would have sent the coat back-- PETKOFF. My coat! BLUNTSCHLI.--Yes: that's the coat I mean--would have sent it back and gone quietly home. Do you suppose I am the sort of fellow a young girl falls in love with? Why, look at our ages! I'm thirty-four: I don't suppose the young lady is much over seventeen. (This estimate produces a marked sensation, all the rest turning and staring at one another. He proceeds innocently.) All that adventure which was life or death to me, was only a schoolgirl's game to her--chocolate creams and hide and seek. Here's the proof! (He takes the photograph from the table.) Now, I ask you, would a woman who took the affair seriously have sent me this and written on it: \"Raina, to her chocolate cream soldier--a souvenir\"? (He exhibits the photograph triumphantly, as if it settled the matter beyond all possibility of refutation.) PETKOFF. That's what I was looking for. How the deuce did it get there? BLUNTSCHLI (to Raina complacently).", " If I were in camp now they'd play all sorts of tricks on me. RAINA (a little moved). I'm sorry. I won't scold you. (Touched by the sympathy in her tone, he raises his head and looks gratefully at her: she immediately draws back and says stiffly) You must excuse me: our soldiers are not like that. (She moves away from the ottoman.) MAN. Oh, yes, they are. There are only two sorts of soldiers: old ones and young ones. I've served fourteen years: half of your fellows never smelt powder before. Why, how is it that you've just beaten us? Sheer ignorance of the art of war, nothing else. (Indignantly.) I never saw anything so unprofessional. RAINA (ironically). Oh, was it unprofessional to beat you? MAN. Well, come, is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of machine guns, with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire? I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. RAINA (eagerly turning to him, as all her enthusiasm and her dream of glory rush back on her). Did you see the great cavalry charge? Oh, tell me about it. Describe it to me. MAN. You never saw a cavalry charge, did you? RAINA. How could I? MAN. Ah, perhaps not--of course. Well, it's a funny sight. It's like slinging a handful of peas against a window pane: first one comes; then two or three close behind him; and then all the rest in a lump. RAINA (her eyes dilating as she raises her clasped hands ecstatically).", " Does he seek to drive us to aspiration by the portrayal of sordidness, to disinterestedness by the picture of selfishness, to illusion by disillusionment? It is impossible to believe that he is unconscious of the humor of his dramatic situations, yet he stoically gives no sign. He even dares the charge, terrible in proportion to its truth, which the most serious of us shrinks from--the lack of a sense of humor. Men would rather have their integrity impugned. In \"Arms and the Man\" the subject which occupies the dramatist's attention is that survival of barbarity--militarism--which raises its horrid head from time to time to cast a doubt on the reality of our civilization. No more hoary superstition survives than that the donning of a uniform changes the nature of the wearer. This notion pervades society to such an extent that when we find some soldiers placed upon the stage acting rationally, our conventionalized senses are shocked. The only men who have no illusions about war are those who have recently been there, and, of course, Mr. Shaw, who has no illusions about anything. It is hard to speak too highly of \"Candida.\" No equally subtle and incisive study of domestic relations exists in the English drama. One has to turn to George Meredith's \"The Egoist\" to find such character dissection. The central note of the play is, that with the true woman, weakness which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful than strength which offers protection."], "What does Bluntschli help Sergius and Petkoff with?": [" BLUNTSCHLI (suddenly attentive and business-like).

Tell them that if they stop to drink or tell stories--if they're five minutes late, they'll have the skin taken off their backs. SERGIUS (rising indignantly). I'll say so.

Good-bye. BLUNTSCHLI. But my bag? CATHERINE. It will be sent on. You will leave me your address. BLUNTSCHLI. True. Allow me.

As he hands her the card, Petkoff, hatless, rushes from the house in a fluster of hospitality, followed by Sergius.) PETKOFF (as he hurries down the steps). My dear Captain Bluntschli-- CATHERINE. Oh Heavens! (She sinks on the seat against the wall.) PETKOFF (too preoccupied to notice her as he shakes Bluntschli's hand heartily). Those stupid people of mine thought I was out here, instead of in the--haw!--library. (He cannot mention the library without betraying how proud he is of it.) I saw you through the window. I was wondering why you didn't come in. Saranoff is with me: you remember him, don't you? SERGIUS (saluting humorously, and then offering his hand with great charm of manner). Welcome, our friend the enemy! PETKOFF. No longer the enemy, happily. (Rather anxiously.) I hope you've come as a friend, and not on business. CATHERINE. Oh, quite as a friend, Paul. I was just asking Captain Bluntschli to stay to lunch; but he declares he must go at once. SERGIUS (sardonically). Impossible, Bluntschli. We want you here badly.

CATHERINE. And so you're no longer a soldier, Sergius. SERGIUS. I am no longer a soldier. Soldiering, my dear madam, is the coward's art of attacking mercilessly when you are strong, and keeping out of harm's way when you are weak. That is the whole secret of successful fighting. Get your enemy at a disadvantage; and never, on any account, fight him on equal terms. Eh, Major! PETKOFF. They wouldn't let us make a fair stand-up fight of it. However, I suppose soldiering has to be a trade like any other trade. SERGIUS. Precisely. But I have no ambition to succeed as a tradesman; so I have taken the advice of that bagman of a captain that settled the exchange of prisoners with us at Peerot, and given it up. PETKOFF. What, that Swiss fellow? Sergius: I've often thought of that exchange since. He over-reached us about those horses. SERGIUS. Of course he over-reached us. His father was a hotel and livery stable keeper; and he owed his first step to his knowledge of horse-dealing. (With mock enthusiasm.) Ah, he was a soldier--every inch a soldier!", " Ah! (She throws the cloak on the ottoman, and comes eagerly to Catherine in her nightgown, a pretty garment, but evidently the only one she has on.) CATHERINE. A great battle at Slivnitza! A victory! And it was won by Sergius. RAINA (with a cry of delight). Ah! (Rapturously.) Oh, mother! (Then, with sudden anxiety) Is father safe? CATHERINE. Of course: he sent me the news. Sergius is the hero of the hour, the idol of the regiment. RAINA. Tell me, tell me. How was it! (Ecstatically) Oh, mother, mother, mother! (Raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman; and they kiss one another frantically.) CATHERINE (with surging enthusiasm). You can't guess how splendid it is. A cavalry charge--think of that! He defied our Russian commanders--acted without orders--led a charge on his own responsibility--headed it himself--was the first man to sweep through their guns. Can't you see it, Raina; our gallant splendid Bulgarians with their swords and eyes flashing, thundering down like an avalanche and scattering the wretched Servian dandies like chaff. And you--you kept Sergius waiting a year before you would be betrothed to him. Oh, if you have a drop of Bulgarian blood in your veins, you will worship him when he comes back. RAINA. What will he care for my poor little worship after the acclamations of a whole army of heroes? But no matter: I am so happy--so proud! (She rises and walks about excitedly.)", " Nicola's the ablest man I've met in Bulgaria. I'll make him manager of a hotel if he can speak French and German. LOUKA (suddenly breaking out at Sergius). I have been insulted by everyone here. You set them the example. You owe me an apology. (Sergius immediately, like a repeating clock of which the spring has been touched, begins to fold his arms.) BLUNTSCHLI (before he can speak). It's no use. He never apologizes. LOUKA. Not to you, his equal and his enemy. To me, his poor servant, he will not refuse to apologize. SERGIUS (approvingly). You are right. (He bends his knee in his grandest manner.) Forgive me! LOUKA. I forgive you. (She timidly gives him her hand, which he kisses.) That touch makes me your affianced wife. SERGIUS (springing up). Ah, I forgot that! LOUKA (coldly). You can withdraw if you like. SERGIUS. Withdraw! Never! You belong to me! (He puts his arm about her and draws her to him.) (Catherine comes in and finds Louka in Sergius's arms, and all the rest gazing at them in bewildered astonishment.) CATHERINE. What does this mean? (Sergius releases Louka.) PETKOFF. Well, my dear, it appears that Sergius is going to marry Louka instead of Raina. (She is about to break out indignantly at him: he stops her by exclaiming testily.) Don't blame me: I've nothing to do with it. (He retreats to the stove.) CATHERINE. Marry Louka! Sergius: you are bound by your word to us!", " Altogether it is clear that here or nowhere is Raina's ideal hero. Catherine is hardly less enthusiastic, and much less reserved in shewing her enthusiasm. As he enters from the stable gate, she rises effusively to greet him. Petkoff is distinctly less disposed to make a fuss about him.) PETKOFF. Here already, Sergius. Glad to see you! CATHERINE. My dear Sergius! (She holds out both her hands.) SERGIUS (kissing them with scrupulous gallantry). My dear mother, if I may call you so. PETKOFF (drily). Mother-in-law, Sergius; mother-in-law! Sit down, and have some coffee. SERGIUS. Thank you, none for me. (He gets away from the table with a certain distaste for Petkoff's enjoyment of it, and posts himself with conscious grace against the rail of the steps leading to the house.) CATHERINE. You look superb--splendid. The campaign has improved you. Everybody here is mad about you. We were all wild with enthusiasm about that magnificent cavalry charge. SERGIUS (with grave irony). Madam: it was the cradle and the grave of my military reputation. CATHERINE. How so? SERGIUS. I won the battle the wrong way when our worthy Russian generals were losing it the right way. That upset their plans, and wounded their self-esteem. Two of their colonels got their regiments driven back on the correct principles of scientific warfare. Two major-generals got killed strictly according to military etiquette."], "To whom does Louka get engaged?": [" BLUNTSCHLI (much startled protesting vehemently). I'm not married. RAINA (with deep reproach). You said you were. BLUNTSCHLI. I did not. I positively did not. I never was married in my life. PETKOFF (exasperated). Raina: will you kindly inform me, if I am not asking too much, which gentleman you are engaged to? RAINA. To neither of them. This young lady (introducing Louka, who faces them all proudly) is the object of Major Saranoff's affections at present. PETKOFF. Louka! Are you mad, Sergius? Why, this girl's engaged to Nicola. NICOLA (coming forward ). I beg your pardon, sir. There is a mistake. Louka is not engaged to me. PETKOFF. Not engaged to you, you scoundrel! Why, you had twenty-five levas from me on the day of your betrothal; and she had that gilt bracelet from Miss Raina. NICOLA (with cool unction). We gave it out so, sir. But it was only to give Louka protection. She had a soul above her station; and I have been no more than her confidential servant. I intend, as you know, sir, to set up a shop later on in Sofia; and I look forward to her custom and recommendation should she marry into the nobility. (He goes out with impressive discretion, leaving them all staring after him.) PETKOFF (breaking the silence). Well, I am---hm! SERGIUS. This is either the finest heroism or the most crawling baseness. Which is it, Bluntschli? BLUNTSCHLI. Never mind whether it's heroism or baseness.", " SERGIUS (recoiling a step). Louka! LOUKA. It shews how little you really care! SERGIUS (dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing politeness). If our conversation is to continue, Louka, you will please remember that a gentleman does not discuss the conduct of the lady he is engaged to with her maid. LOUKA. It's so hard to know what a gentleman considers right. I thought from your trying to kiss me that you had given up being so particular. SERGIUS (turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes back into the garden from the gateway). Devil! devil! LOUKA. Ha! ha! I expect one of the six of you is very like me, sir, though I am only Miss Raina's maid. (She goes back to her work at the table, taking no further notice of him.) SERGIUS (speaking to himself). Which of the six is the real man?--that's the question that torments me. One of them is a hero, another a buffoon, another a humbug, another perhaps a bit of a blackguard. (He pauses and looks furtively at Louka, as he adds with deep bitterness) And one, at least, is a coward--jealous, like all cowards. (He goes to the table.) Louka. LOUKA. Yes? SERGIUS. Who is my rival? LOUKA. You shall never get that out of me, for love or money. SERGIUS. Why? LOUKA. Never mind why. Besides, you would tell that I told you; and I should lose my place. SERGIUS (holding out his right hand in affirmation). No; on the honor of a--(He checks himself, and his hand drops nerveless as he concludes, sardonically)--of a man capable of behaving as I have been behaving for the last five minutes.", " He has a big carpet bag, madam. CATHERINE. Oh, Heavens, he's come to return the coat! Send him away--say we're not at home--ask him to leave his address and I'll write to him--Oh, stop: that will never do. Wait! (She throws herself into a chair to think it out. Louka waits.) The master and Major Saranoff are busy in the library, aren't they? LOUKA. Yes, madam. CATHERINE (decisively). Bring the gentleman out here at once. (Imperatively.) And be very polite to him. Don't delay. Here (impatiently snatching the salver from her): leave that here; and go straight back to him. LOUKA. Yes, madam. (Going.) CATHERINE. Louka! LOUKA (stopping). Yes, madam. CATHERINE. Is the library door shut? LOUKA. I think so, madam. CATHERINE. If not, shut it as you pass through. LOUKA. Yes, madam. (Going.) CATHERINE. Stop! (Louka stops.) He will have to go out that way (indicating the gate of the stable yard). Tell Nicola to bring his bag here after him. Don't forget. LOUKA (surprised). His bag? CATHERINE. Yes, here, as soon as possible. (Vehemently.) Be quick! (Louka runs into the house. Catherine snatches her apron off and throws it behind a bush. She then takes up the salver and uses it as a mirror, with the result that the handkerchief tied round her head follows the apron. A touch to her hair and a shake to her dressing gown makes her presentable.) Oh, how--how--how can a man be such a fool! Such a moment to select!", " NICOLA (in a smooth, elderly manner). Oh, no, sir, thank you kindly. I was only speaking to this foolish girl about her habit of running up here to the library whenever she gets a chance, to look at the books. That's the worst of her education, sir: it gives her habits above her station. (To Louka.) Make that table tidy, Louka, for the Major. (He goes out sedately.) (Louka, without looking at Sergius, begins to arrange the papers on the table. He crosses slowly to her, and studies the arrangement of her sleeve reflectively.) SERGIUS. Let me see: is there a mark there? (He turns up the bracelet and sees the bruise made by his grasp. She stands motionless, not looking at him: fascinated, but on her guard.) Ffff! Does it hurt? LOUKA. Yes. SERGIUS. Shall I cure it? LOUKA (instantly withdrawing herself proudly, but still not looking at him). No. You cannot cure it now. SERGIUS (masterfully). Quite sure? (He makes a movement as if to take her in his arms.) LOUKA. Don't trifle with me, please. An officer should not trifle with a servant. SERGIUS (touching the arm with a merciless stroke of his forefinger). That was no trifle, Louka. LOUKA. No. (Looking at him for the first time.) Are you sorry? SERGIUS (with measured emphasis, folding his arms). I am never sorry. LOUKA (wistfully). I wish I could believe a man could be so unlike a woman as that. I wonder are you really a brave man? SERGIUS (unaffectedly, relaxing his attitude)."], "What job does Nicola earn at the end of the play?": [" Oh, whilst you were away. It is her latest fancy. PETKOFF (testily). And has Nicola taken to drinking? He used to be careful enough. First he shews Captain Bluntschli out here when he knew quite well I was in the--hum!--library; and then he goes downstairs and breaks Raina's chocolate soldier. He must--(At this moment Nicola appears at the top of the steps R., with a carpet bag. He descends; places it respectfully before Bluntschli; and waits for further orders. General amazement. Nicola, unconscious of the effect he is producing, looks perfectly satisfied with himself. When Petkoff recovers his power of speech, he breaks out at him with) Are you mad, Nicola? NICOLA (taken aback). Sir? PETKOFF. What have you brought that for? NICOLA. My lady's orders, sir. Louka told me that-- CATHERINE (interrupting him). My orders! Why should I order you to bring Captain Bluntschli's luggage out here? What are you thinking of, Nicola? NICOLA (after a moment's bewilderment, picking up the bag as he addresses Bluntschli with the very perfection of servile discretion). I beg your pardon, sir, I am sure. (To Catherine.) My fault, madam! I hope you'll overlook it! (He bows, and is going to the steps with the bag, when Petkoff addresses him angrily.) PETKOFF. You'd better go and slam that bag, too, down on Miss Raina's ice pudding! (This is too much for Nicola. The bag drops from his hands on Petkoff's corns, eliciting a roar of anguish from him.)", " How long would your father be left on his little farm? (She impatiently throws away the end of her cigaret, and stamps on it.) Child, you don't know the power such high people have over the like of you and me when we try to rise out of our poverty against them. (He goes close to her and lowers his voice.) Look at me, ten years in their service. Do you think I know no secrets? I know things about the mistress that she wouldn't have the master know for a thousand levas. I know things about him that she wouldn't let him hear the last of for six months if I blabbed them to her. I know things about Raina that would break off her match with Sergius if-- LOUKA (turning on him quickly). How do you know? I never told you! NICOLA (opening his eyes cunningly). So that's your little secret, is it? I thought it might be something like that. Well, you take my advice, and be respectful; and make the mistress feel that no matter what you know or don't know, they can depend on you to hold your tongue and serve the family faithfully. That's what they like; and that's how you'll make most out of them. LOUKA (with searching scorn). You have the soul of a servant, Nicola. NICOLA (complacently). Yes: that's the secret of success in service. (A loud knocking with a whip handle on a wooden door, outside on the left, is heard.) MALE VOICE OUTSIDE. Hollo! Hollo there! Nicola! LOUKA. Master! back from the war!", " His head is shaved up to the crown, giving him a high Japanese forehead. His name is Nicola. NICOLA. Be warned in time, Louka: mend your manners. I know the mistress. She is so grand that she never dreams that any servant could dare to be disrespectful to her; but if she once suspects that you are defying her, out you go. LOUKA. I do defy her. I will defy her. What do I care for her? NICOLA. If you quarrel with the family, I never can marry you. It's the same as if you quarrelled with me! LOUKA. You take her part against me, do you? NICOLA (sedately). I shall always be dependent on the good will of the family. When I leave their service and start a shop in Sofia, their custom will be half my capital: their bad word would ruin me. LOUKA. You have no spirit. I should like to see them dare say a word against me! NICOLA (pityingly). I should have expected more sense from you, Louka. But you're young, you're young! LOUKA. Yes; and you like me the better for it, don't you? But I know some family secrets they wouldn't care to have told, young as I am. Let them quarrel with me if they dare! NICOLA (with compassionate superiority). Do you know what they would do if they heard you talk like that? LOUKA. What could they do? NICOLA. Discharge you for untruthfulness. Who would believe any stories you told after that? Who would give you another situation? Who in this house would dare be seen speaking to you ever again?", " What does that mean? LOUKA (fiercely). It means-- SERGIUS (interrupting her slightingly). Oh, I remember, the ice pudding. A paltry taunt, girl. (Major Petkoff enters, in his shirtsleeves.) PETKOFF. Excuse my shirtsleeves, gentlemen. Raina: somebody has been wearing that coat of mine: I'll swear it--somebody with bigger shoulders than mine. It's all burst open at the back. Your mother is mending it. I wish she'd make haste. I shall catch cold. (He looks more attentively at them.) Is anything the matter? RAINA. No. (She sits down at the stove with a tranquil air.) SERGIUS. Oh, no! (He sits down at the end of the table, as at first.) BLUNTSCHLI (who is already seated). Nothing, nothing. PETKOFF (sitting down on the ottoman in his old place). That's all right. (He notices Louka.) Anything the matter, Louka? LOUKA. No, sir. PETKOFF (genially). That's all right. (He sneezes.) Go and ask your mistress for my coat, like a good girl, will you? (She turns to obey; but Nicola enters with the coat; and she makes a pretence of having business in the room by taking the little table with the hookah away to the wall near the windows.) RAINA (rising quickly, as she sees the coat on Nicola's arm). Here it is, papa. Give it to me, Nicola; and do you put some more wood on the fire.

PETKOFF (to Raina, teasing her affectionately)."], "What is revealed about Bluntschli in Act Three?": [" I have put everything right, I hope, gracious young lady! RAINA (in uncontrollable vexation). I quite agree with your account of yourself. You are a romantic idiot. (Bluntschli is unspeakably taken aback.) Next time I hope you will know the difference between a schoolgirl of seventeen and a woman of twenty-three. BLUNTSCHLI (stupefied). Twenty-three! (She snaps the photograph contemptuously from his hand; tears it across; and throws the pieces at his feet.) SERGIUS (with grim enjoyment of Bluntschli's discomfiture). Bluntschli: my one last belief is gone. Your sagacity is a fraud, like all the other things. You have less sense than even I have. BLUNTSCHLI (overwhelmed). Twenty-three! Twenty-three!! (He considers.) Hm! (Swiftly making up his mind.) In that case, Major Petkoff, I beg to propose formally to become a suitor for your daughter's hand, in place of Major Saranoff retired. RAINA. You dare! BLUNTSCHLI. If you were twenty-three when you said those things to me this afternoon, I shall take them seriously. CATHERINE (loftily polite). I doubt, sir, whether you quite realize either my daughter's position or that of Major Sergius Saranoff, whose place you propose to take. The Petkoffs and the Saranoffs are known as the richest and most important families in the country. Our position is almost historical: we can go back for nearly twenty years. PETKOFF. Oh, never mind that, Catherine.", " BLUNTSCHLI (suddenly attentive and business-like). Phillipopolis! The forage is the trouble, eh? PETKOFF (eagerly). Yes, that's it. (To Sergius.) He sees the whole thing at once. BLUNTSCHLI. I think I can shew you how to manage that. SERGIUS. Invaluable man! Come along! (Towering over Bluntschli, he puts his hand on his shoulder and takes him to the steps, Petkoff following. As Bluntschli puts his foot on the first step, Raina comes out of the house.) RAINA (completely losing her presence of mind). Oh, the chocolate cream soldier! (Bluntschli stands rigid. Sergius, amazed, looks at Raina, then at Petkoff, who looks back at him and then at his wife.) CATHERINE (with commanding presence of mind). My dear Raina, don't you see that we have a guest here--Captain Bluntschli, one of our new Servian friends? (Raina bows; Bluntschli bows.) RAINA. How silly of me! (She comes down into the centre of the group, between Bluntschli and Petkoff) I made a beautiful ornament this morning for the ice pudding; and that stupid Nicola has just put down a pile of plates on it and spoiled it. (To Bluntschli, winningly.) I hope you didn't think that you were the chocolate cream soldier, Captain Bluntschli. BLUNTSCHLI (laughing). I assure you I did. (Stealing a whimsical glance at her.) Your explanation was a relief. PETKOFF (suspiciously, to Raina). And since when, pray, have you taken to cooking? CATHERINE.", " Begone, you butter-fingered donkey. NICOLA (snatching up the bag, and escaping into the house). Yes, sir. CATHERINE. Oh, never mind, Paul, don't be angry! PETKOFF (muttering). Scoundrel. He's got out of hand while I was away. I'll teach him. (Recollecting his guest.) Oh, well, never mind. Come, Bluntschli, lets have no more nonsense about you having to go away. You know very well you're not going back to Switzerland yet. Until you do go back you'll stay with us. RAINA. Oh, do, Captain Bluntschli. PETKOFF (to Catherine). Now, Catherine, it's of you that he's afraid. Press him and he'll stay. CATHERINE. Of course I shall be only too delighted if (appealingly) Captain Bluntschli really wishes to stay. He knows my wishes. BLUNTSCHLI (in his driest military manner). I am at madame's orders. SERGIUS (cordially). That settles it! PETKOFF (heartily). Of course! RAINA. You see, you must stay! BLUNTSCHLI (smiling). Well, If I must, I must! (Gesture of despair from Catherine.) ACT III In the library after lunch. It is not much of a library, its literary equipment consisting of a single fixed shelf stocked with old paper-covered novels, broken backed, coffee stained, torn and thumbed, and a couple of little hanging shelves with a few gift books on them, the rest of the wall space being occupied by trophies of war and the chase. But it is a most comfortable sitting-room. A row of three large windows in the front of the house shew a mountain panorama, which is just now seen in one of its softest aspects in the mellowing afternoon light.", " (To Bluntschli.) We should be most happy, Bluntschli, if it were only a question of your position; but hang it, you know, Raina is accustomed to a very comfortable establishment. Sergius keeps twenty horses. BLUNTSCHLI. But what on earth is the use of twenty horses? Why, it's a circus. CATHERINE (severely). My daughter, sir, is accustomed to a first-rate stable. RAINA. Hush, mother, you're making me ridiculous. BLUNTSCHLI. Oh, well, if it comes to a question of an establishment, here goes! (He goes impetuously to the table and seizes the papers in the blue envelope.) How many horses did you say? SERGIUS. Twenty, noble Switzer! BLUNTSCHLI. I have two hundred horses. (They are amazed.) How many carriages? SERGIUS. Three. BLUNTSCHLI. I have seventy. Twenty-four of them will hold twelve inside, besides two on the box, without counting the driver and conductor. How many tablecloths have you? SERGIUS. How the deuce do I know? BLUNTSCHLI. Have you four thousand? SERGIUS. NO. BLUNTSCHLI. I have. I have nine thousand six hundred pairs of sheets and blankets, with two thousand four hundred eider-down quilts. I have ten thousand knives and forks, and the same quantity of dessert spoons. I have six hundred servants. I have six palatial establishments, besides two livery stables, a tea garden and a private house. I have four medals for distinguished services; I have the rank of an officer and the standing of a gentleman; and I have three native languages."], "What does the Petkoff family brag about?": [" His head is shaved up to the crown, giving him a high Japanese forehead.

Sir! PETKOFF. Did you spoil any pastry of Miss Raina's this morning? NICOLA. You heard Miss Raina say that I did, sir. PETKOFF. I know that, you idiot. Was it true? NICOLA. I am sure Miss Raina is incapable of saying anything that is not true, sir. PETKOFF. Are you? Then I'm not. (Turning to the others.) Come: do you think I don't see it all?

(He looks at them. They are all very serious and very conscious.) Do you mean to tell me that Raina sends photographic souvenirs to other men? SERGIUS (enigmatically). The world is not such an innocent place as we used to think, Petkoff. BLUNTSCHLI (rising). It's all right, Major. I'm the chocolate cream soldier. (Petkoff and Sergius are equally astonished.) The gracious young lady saved my life by giving me chocolate creams when I was starving--shall I ever forget their flavour! My late friend Stolz told you the story at Peerot. I was the fugitive. PETKOFF. You! (He gasps.) Sergius: do you remember how those two women went on this morning when we mentioned it? (Sergius smiles cynically. Petkoff confronts Raina severely.)

I've learnt that while you were away. PETKOFF. Well, I'll tell you something I've learnt, too. Civilized people don't hang out their washing to dry where visitors can see it; so you'd better have all that (indicating the clothes on the bushes) put somewhere else. CATHERINE.

If that is Major Saranoff, bring him round this way. (He pronounces the name with the stress on the second syllable--Sarah-noff.) NICOLA. Yes, sir. (He goes into the stable yard.) PETKOFF. You must talk to him, my dear, until Raina takes him off our hands. He bores my life out about our not promoting him--over my head, mind you. CATHERINE.

Yes, so that he could throw away whole brigades instead of regiments.", " There's only one thing I want to make me thoroughly comfortable. CATHERINE. What is that? PETKOFF. My old coat.

My dear Catherine, I tell you I've looked there. Am I to believe my own eyes or not? (Catherine quietly rises and presses the button of the electric bell by the fireplace.) What are you shewing off that bell for? (She looks at him majestically, and silently resumes her chair and her needlework.) My dear: if you think the obstinacy of your sex can make a coat out of two old dressing gowns of Raina's, your waterproof, and my mackintosh, you're mistaken. That's exactly what the blue closet contains at present. (Nicola presents himself.) CATHERINE (unmoved by Petkoff's sally). Nicola: go to the blue closet and bring your master's old coat here--the braided one he usually wears in the house. NICOLA. Yes, madam. (Nicola goes out.) PETKOFF. Catherine. CATHERINE. Yes, Paul?

RAINA. Come away from the window--please. (She coaxes him back to the middle of the room. He submits humbly. She releases him, and addresses him patronizingly.) Now listen. You must trust to our hospitality. You do not yet know in whose house you are. I am a Petkoff. MAN. What's that? RAINA (rather indignantly). I mean that I belong to the family of the Petkoffs, the richest and best known in our country. MAN. Oh, yes, of course. I beg your pardon. The Petkoffs, to be sure. How stupid of me! RAINA.

Yes: that at least is real about me. LOUKA. Did you find in the charge that the men whose fathers are poor like mine were any less brave than the men who are rich like you? SERGIUS (with bitter levity.) Not a bit. They all slashed and cursed and yelled like heroes. Psha! the courage to rage and kill is cheap. I have an English bull terrier who has as much of that sort of courage as the whole Bulgarian nation, and the whole Russian nation at its back. But he lets my groom thrash him, all the same. That's your soldier all over! No, Louka, your poor men can cut throats; but they are afraid of their officers; they put up with insults and blows; they stand by and see one another punished like children---aye, and help to do it when they are ordered. And the officers!---well (with a short, bitter laugh) I am an officer. Oh, (fervently) give me the man who will defy to the death any power on earth or in heaven that sets itself up against his own will and conscience: he alone is the brave man. LOUKA. How easy it is to talk! Men never seem to me to grow up: they all have schoolboy's ideas. You don't know what true courage is. SERGIUS (ironically). Indeed! I am willing to be instructed. LOUKA.

A touch to her hair and a shake to her dressing gown makes her presentable.) Oh, how--how--how can a man be such a fool! Such a moment to select!"], "What does Sergius do to Louka when they speak privately?": [" Nicola's the ablest man I've met in Bulgaria. I'll make him manager of a hotel if he can speak French and German. LOUKA (suddenly breaking out at Sergius). I have been insulted by everyone here. You set them the example. You owe me an apology. (Sergius immediately, like a repeating clock of which the spring has been touched, begins to fold his arms.) BLUNTSCHLI (before he can speak). It's no use. He never apologizes. LOUKA. Not to you, his equal and his enemy. To me, his poor servant, he will not refuse to apologize. SERGIUS (approvingly). You are right. (He bends his knee in his grandest manner.) Forgive me! LOUKA. I forgive you. (She timidly gives him her hand, which he kisses.) That touch makes me your affianced wife. SERGIUS (springing up). Ah, I forgot that! LOUKA (coldly). You can withdraw if you like. SERGIUS. Withdraw! Never! You belong to me! (He puts his arm about her and draws her to him.) (Catherine comes in and finds Louka in Sergius's arms, and all the rest gazing at them in bewildered astonishment.) CATHERINE. What does this mean? (Sergius releases Louka.) PETKOFF. Well, my dear, it appears that Sergius is going to marry Louka instead of Raina. (She is about to break out indignantly at him: he stops her by exclaiming testily.) Don't blame me: I've nothing to do with it. (He retreats to the stove.) CATHERINE. Marry Louka! Sergius: you are bound by your word to us!", " SERGIUS (recoiling a step). Louka! LOUKA. It shews how little you really care! SERGIUS (dropping his familiarity and speaking with freezing politeness). If our conversation is to continue, Louka, you will please remember that a gentleman does not discuss the conduct of the lady he is engaged to with her maid. LOUKA. It's so hard to know what a gentleman considers right. I thought from your trying to kiss me that you had given up being so particular. SERGIUS (turning from her and striking his forehead as he comes back into the garden from the gateway). Devil! devil! LOUKA. Ha! ha! I expect one of the six of you is very like me, sir, though I am only Miss Raina's maid. (She goes back to her work at the table, taking no further notice of him.) SERGIUS (speaking to himself). Which of the six is the real man?--that's the question that torments me. One of them is a hero, another a buffoon, another a humbug, another perhaps a bit of a blackguard. (He pauses and looks furtively at Louka, as he adds with deep bitterness) And one, at least, is a coward--jealous, like all cowards. (He goes to the table.) Louka. LOUKA. Yes? SERGIUS. Who is my rival? LOUKA. You shall never get that out of me, for love or money. SERGIUS. Why? LOUKA. Never mind why. Besides, you would tell that I told you; and I should lose my place. SERGIUS (holding out his right hand in affirmation). No; on the honor of a--(He checks himself, and his hand drops nerveless as he concludes, sardonically)--of a man capable of behaving as I have been behaving for the last five minutes.", " NICOLA (in a smooth, elderly manner). Oh, no, sir, thank you kindly. I was only speaking to this foolish girl about her habit of running up here to the library whenever she gets a chance, to look at the books. That's the worst of her education, sir: it gives her habits above her station. (To Louka.) Make that table tidy, Louka, for the Major. (He goes out sedately.) (Louka, without looking at Sergius, begins to arrange the papers on the table. He crosses slowly to her, and studies the arrangement of her sleeve reflectively.) SERGIUS. Let me see: is there a mark there? (He turns up the bracelet and sees the bruise made by his grasp. She stands motionless, not looking at him: fascinated, but on her guard.) Ffff! Does it hurt? LOUKA. Yes. SERGIUS. Shall I cure it? LOUKA (instantly withdrawing herself proudly, but still not looking at him). No. You cannot cure it now. SERGIUS (masterfully). Quite sure? (He makes a movement as if to take her in his arms.) LOUKA. Don't trifle with me, please. An officer should not trifle with a servant. SERGIUS (touching the arm with a merciless stroke of his forefinger). That was no trifle, Louka. LOUKA. No. (Looking at him for the first time.) Are you sorry? SERGIUS (with measured emphasis, folding his arms). I am never sorry. LOUKA (wistfully). I wish I could believe a man could be so unlike a woman as that. I wonder are you really a brave man? SERGIUS (unaffectedly, relaxing his attitude).", " SERGIUS. Be quick. If you are away five minutes, it will seem five hours. (Raina runs to the top of the steps and turns there to exchange a look with him and wave him a kiss with both hands. He looks after her with emotion for a moment, then turns slowly away, his face radiant with the exultation of the scene which has just passed. The movement shifts his field of vision, into the corner of which there now comes the tail of Louka's double apron. His eye gleams at once. He takes a stealthy look at her, and begins to twirl his moustache nervously, with his left hand akimbo on his hip. Finally, striking the ground with his heels in something of a cavalry swagger, he strolls over to the left of the table, opposite her, and says) Louka: do you know what the higher love is? LOUKA (astonished). No, sir. SERGIUS. Very fatiguing thing to keep up for any length of time, Louka. One feels the need of some relief after it. LOUKA (innocently). Perhaps you would like some coffee, sir? (She stretches her hand across the table for the coffee pot.) SERGIUS (taking her hand). Thank you, Louka. LOUKA (pretending to pull). Oh, sir, you know I didn't mean that. I'm surprised at you! SERGIUS (coming clear of the table and drawing her with him). I am surprised at myself, Louka. What would Sergius, the hero of Slivnitza, say if he saw me now? What would Sergius, the apostle of the higher love, say if he saw me now?"], "What does the play end in a flurry of?": [" Candida is quite unpoetic, as, indeed, with rare exceptions, women are prone to be.

(She impatiently throws away the end of her cigaret, and stamps on it.) Child, you don't know the power such high people have over the like of you and me when we try to rise out of our poverty against them. (He goes close to her and lowers his voice.) Look at me, ten years in their service. Do you think I know no secrets? I know things about the mistress that she wouldn't have the master know for a thousand levas. I know things about him that she wouldn't let him hear the last of for six months if I blabbed them to her. I know things about Raina that would break off her match with Sergius if-- LOUKA (turning on him quickly). How do you know? I never told you! NICOLA (opening his eyes cunningly). So that's your little secret, is it? I thought it might be something like that. Well, you take my advice, and be respectful; and make the mistress feel that no matter what you know or don't know, they can depend on you to hold your tongue and serve the family faithfully. That's what they like; and that's how you'll make most out of them. LOUKA (with searching scorn). You have the soul of a servant, Nicola. NICOLA (complacently). Yes: that's the secret of success in service. (A loud knocking with a whip handle on a wooden door, outside on the left, is heard.) MALE VOICE OUTSIDE. Hollo! Hollo there! Nicola! LOUKA. Master! back from the war!", " The room is lighted by a candle on the chest of drawers, and another on the dressing table, with a box of matches beside it. The window is hinged doorwise and stands wide open, folding back to the left. Outside a pair of wooden shutters, opening outwards, also stand open. On the balcony, a young lady, intensely conscious of the romantic beauty of the night, and of the fact that her own youth and beauty is a part of it, is on the balcony, gazing at the snowy Balkans. She is covered by a long mantle of furs, worth, on a moderate estimate, about three times the furniture of her room. Her reverie is interrupted by her mother, Catherine Petkoff, a woman over forty, imperiously energetic, with magnificent black hair and eyes, who might be a very splendid specimen of the wife of a mountain farmer, but is determined to be a Viennese lady, and to that end wears a fashionable tea gown on all occasions. CATHERINE (entering hastily, full of good news). Raina--(she pronounces it Rah-eena, with the stress on the ee) Raina--(she goes to the bed, expecting to find Raina there.) Why, where--(Raina looks into the room.) Heavens! child, are you out in the night air instead of in your bed? You'll catch your death. Louka told me you were asleep. RAINA (coming in). I sent her away. I wanted to be alone. The stars are so beautiful! What is the matter? CATHERINE. Such news. There has been a battle! RAINA (her eyes dilating).", " What does that mean? LOUKA (fiercely). It means-- SERGIUS (interrupting her slightingly). Oh, I remember, the ice pudding. A paltry taunt, girl. (Major Petkoff enters, in his shirtsleeves.) PETKOFF. Excuse my shirtsleeves, gentlemen. Raina: somebody has been wearing that coat of mine: I'll swear it--somebody with bigger shoulders than mine. It's all burst open at the back. Your mother is mending it. I wish she'd make haste. I shall catch cold. (He looks more attentively at them.) Is anything the matter? RAINA. No. (She sits down at the stove with a tranquil air.) SERGIUS. Oh, no! (He sits down at the end of the table, as at first.) BLUNTSCHLI (who is already seated). Nothing, nothing. PETKOFF (sitting down on the ottoman in his old place). That's all right. (He notices Louka.) Anything the matter, Louka? LOUKA. No, sir. PETKOFF (genially). That's all right. (He sneezes.) Go and ask your mistress for my coat, like a good girl, will you? (She turns to obey; but Nicola enters with the coat; and she makes a pretence of having business in the room by taking the little table with the hookah away to the wall near the windows.) RAINA (rising quickly, as she sees the coat on Nicola's arm). Here it is, papa. Give it to me, Nicola; and do you put some more wood on the fire.

They'll be far more frightened of you than of me. CATHERINE (putting down her embroidery). I daresay I had better. You will only splutter at them.

You look ever so much nicer than when we last met. (He looks up, surprised.) What have you done to yourself? BLUNTSCHLI. Washed; brushed; good night's sleep and breakfast. That's all. RAINA. Did you get back safely that morning? BLUNTSCHLI. Quite, thanks. RAINA. Were they angry with you for running away from Sergius's charge? BLUNTSCHLI. No, they were glad; because they'd all just run away themselves. RAINA (going to the table, and leaning over it towards him). It must have made a lovely story for them--all that about me and my room. BLUNTSCHLI. Capital story. But I only told it to one of them--a particular friend. RAINA. On whose discretion you could absolutely rely? BLUNTSCHLI. Absolutely. RAINA. Hm! He told it all to my father and Sergius the day you exchanged the prisoners.

Louka makes way proudly for her, and then goes into the house.) RAINA. I'm ready! What's the matter? (Gaily.) Have you been flirting with Louka? SERGIUS (hastily). No, no. How can you think such a thing? RAINA (ashamed of herself). Forgive me, dear: it was only a jest. I am so happy to-day. (He goes quickly to her, and kisses her hand remorsefully. Catherine comes out and calls to them from the top of the steps.) CATHERINE (coming down to them). I am sorry to disturb you, children; but Paul is distracted over those three regiments. He does not know how to get them to Phillipopolis; and he objects to every suggestion of mine. You must go and help him, Sergius. He is in the library. RAINA (disappointed). But we are just going out for a walk. SERGIUS. I shall not be long. Wait for me just five minutes. (He runs up the steps to the door.) RAINA (following him to the foot of the steps and looking up at him with timid coquetry). I shall go round and wait in full view of the library windows. Be sure you draw father's attention to me. If you are a moment longer than five minutes, I shall go in and fetch you, regiments or no regiments. SERGIUS (laughing). Very well. (He goes in. Raina watches him until he is out of her sight.", " If I were in camp now they'd play all sorts of tricks on me. RAINA (a little moved). I'm sorry. I won't scold you. (Touched by the sympathy in her tone, he raises his head and looks gratefully at her: she immediately draws back and says stiffly) You must excuse me: our soldiers are not like that. (She moves away from the ottoman.) MAN. Oh, yes, they are. There are only two sorts of soldiers: old ones and young ones. I've served fourteen years: half of your fellows never smelt powder before. Why, how is it that you've just beaten us? Sheer ignorance of the art of war, nothing else. (Indignantly.) I never saw anything so unprofessional. RAINA (ironically). Oh, was it unprofessional to beat you? MAN. Well, come, is it professional to throw a regiment of cavalry on a battery of machine guns, with the dead certainty that if the guns go off not a horse or man will ever get within fifty yards of the fire? I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. RAINA (eagerly turning to him, as all her enthusiasm and her dream of glory rush back on her). Did you see the great cavalry charge? Oh, tell me about it. Describe it to me. MAN. You never saw a cavalry charge, did you? RAINA. How could I? MAN. Ah, perhaps not--of course. Well, it's a funny sight. It's like slinging a handful of peas against a window pane: first one comes; then two or three close behind him; and then all the rest in a lump.
