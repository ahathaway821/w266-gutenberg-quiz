My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you, but at dinner-time I pray you have in mind where we must meet. BASSANIO. I will not fail you. GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio, You have too much respect upon the world. They lose it that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang\u2019d. ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano, A stage, where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one. GRATIANO. Let me play the fool, With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio, (I love thee, and \u2019tis my love that speaks): There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, And do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be dress\u2019d in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, As who should say, \u201cI am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\u201d O my Antonio, I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, If they should speak, would almost damn those ears Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.", " A street. Enter Antonio, Salarino and Solanio. ANTONIO. In sooth I know not why I am so sad, It wearies me. you say it wearies you; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff \u2019tis made of, whereof it is born, I am to learn. And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself. SALARINO. Your mind is tossing on the ocean, There where your argosies, with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or as it were the pageants of the sea, Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven wings. SOLANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, Peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads; And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt Would make me sad. SALARINO. My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea. I should not see the sandy hour-glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats, And see my wealthy Andrew dock\u2019d in sand, Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial. Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which, touching but my gentle vessel\u2019s side, Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing?"], "From what characterflaw does Bassanio believe Gratiano suffers?": [" LEONARDO.

I have suit to you. BASSANIO. You have obtain\u2019d it. GRATIANO. You must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont. BASSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano, Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice, Parts that become thee happily enough, And in such eyes as ours appear not faults; But where thou art not known, why there they show Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour I be misconst\u2019red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes. GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me. If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect, and swear but now and then, Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say \u201camen\u201d; Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more. BASSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing. GRATIANO. Nay, but I bar tonight, you shall not gauge me By what we do tonight. BASSANIO. No, that were pity.

BASSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way, with more advised watch To find the other forth; and by adventuring both I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost. But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak. BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu\u2019d To Cato\u2019s daughter, Brutus\u2019 Portia.

PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, prince. If you choose that, then I am yours withal. PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see. I will survey the inscriptions back again. What says this leaden casket? \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead! This casket threatens; men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross, I\u2019ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. What says the silver with her virgin hue? \u201cWho chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\u201d As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand. If thou be\u2019st rated by thy estimation Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady.

I will not choose what many men desire, Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house, Tell me once more what title thou dost bear. \u201cWho chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\u201d And well said too; for who shall go about To cozen fortune, and be honourable Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity. O that estates, degrees, and offices Were not deriv\u2019d corruptly, and that clear honour Were purchas\u2019d by the merit of the wearer!

You are welcome. Take your place. Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court? PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause. Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew? DUKE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth. PORTIA. Is your name Shylock? SHYLOCK. Shylock is my name. PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow, Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed. [_To Antonio_.] You stand within his danger, do you not? ANTONIO. Ay, so he says. PORTIA. Do you confess the bond? ANTONIO. I do. PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful. SHYLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that. PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain\u2019d, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. \u2019Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown. His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God\u2019s When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy, And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy.", " O love, dispatch all business and be gone! BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste; but, till I come again, No bed shall e\u2019er be guilty of my stay, Nor rest be interposer \u2019twixt us twain. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. Venice. A street. Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler. SHYLOCK. Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy. This is the fool that lent out money gratis. Gaoler, look to him. ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond, speak not against my bond. I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call\u2019dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But since I am a dog, beware my fangs; The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request. ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I\u2019ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I\u2019ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not, I\u2019ll have no speaking, I will have my bond. [_Exit._] SALARINO. It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men. ANTONIO. Let him alone. I\u2019ll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life, his reason well I know: I oft deliver\u2019d from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me. Therefore he hates me. SALARINO. I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.", " If I can catch him once upon the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him! BASSANIO. Shylock, do you hear? SHYLOCK. I am debating of my present store, And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me. But soft! how many months Do you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior, Your worship was the last man in our mouths. ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I\u2019ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess\u2019d How much ye would? SHYLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats. ANTONIO. And for three months. SHYLOCK. I had forgot, three months, you told me so. Well then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you, Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage. ANTONIO. I do never use it. SHYLOCK. When Jacob graz\u2019d his uncle Laban\u2019s sheep,\u2014 This Jacob from our holy Abram was As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor; ay, he was the third. ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest? SHYLOCK. No, not take interest, not, as you would say, Directly interest; mark what Jacob did.", " Enter Shylock. How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants? SHYLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter\u2019s flight. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal. SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam. SHYLOCK. She is damn\u2019d for it. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, if the devil may be her judge. SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel! SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years? SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood. SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\u2019s that good for? SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac\u2019d me and hind\u2019red me half a million, laugh\u2019d at my losses, mock\u2019d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies."], "How does Shylockinitially describe his demand for a pound of flesh to Bassanio andAntonio?": [" Come, prepare. PORTIA. Tarry a little, there is something else. This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood. The words expressly are \u201ca pound of flesh\u201d: Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh, But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate Unto the state of Venice. GRATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge! SHYLOCK. Is that the law? PORTIA. Thyself shalt see the act. For, as thou urgest justice, be assur\u2019d Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir\u2019st. GRATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge! SHYLOCK. I take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go. BASSANIO. Here is the money. PORTIA. Soft! The Jew shall have all justice. Soft! no haste! He shall have nothing but the penalty. GRATIANO. O Jew, an upright judge, a learned judge! PORTIA. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh. Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more, But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak\u2019st more Or less than a just pound, be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance, Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate. GRATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew! Now, infidel, I have you on the hip. PORTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.", " Therefore, I do beseech you, Make no moe offers, use no farther means, But with all brief and plain conveniency. Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will. BASSANIO. For thy three thousand ducats here is six. SHYLOCK. If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts, and every part a ducat, I would not draw them, I would have my bond. DUKE. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend\u2019ring none? SHYLOCK. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? You have among you many a purchas\u2019d slave, Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules, You use in abject and in slavish parts, Because you bought them. Shall I say to you \u201cLet them be free, marry them to your heirs? Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates Be season\u2019d with such viands\u201d? You will answer \u201cThe slaves are ours.\u201d So do I answer you: The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought; \u2019tis mine and I will have it. If you deny me, fie upon your law! There is no force in the decrees of Venice. I stand for judgment. Answer; shall I have it? DUKE. Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learned doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here today. SALARINO. My lord, here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor, New come from Padua. DUKE. Bring us the letters. Call the messenger. BASSANIO. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!", " Commend me to your honourable wife, Tell her the process of Antonio\u2019s end, Say how I lov\u2019d you, speak me fair in death. And when the tale is told, bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love. Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt. For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I\u2019ll pay it instantly with all my heart. BASSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself, But life itself, my wife, and all the world, Are not with me esteem\u2019d above thy life. I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil, to deliver you. PORTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer. GRATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love. I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew. NERISSA. \u2019Tis well you offer it behind her back, The wish would make else an unquiet house. SHYLOCK. These be the Christian husbands!

Bring me the fairest creature northward born, Where Ph\u0153bus\u2019 fire scarce thaws the icicles, And let us make incision for your love To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine. I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine Hath fear\u2019d the valiant; by my love I swear The best-regarded virgins of our clime Have lov\u2019d it too. I would not change this hue, Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen. PORTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden\u2019s eyes; Besides, the lott\u2019ry of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing. But if my father had not scanted me And hedg\u2019d me by his wit to yield myself His wife who wins me by that means I told you, Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair As any comer I have look\u2019d on yet For my affection. PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Even for that I thank you. Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune. By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince, That won three fields of Sultan Solyman, I would o\u2019erstare the sternest eyes that look, Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth, Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear, Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey, To win thee, lady.", " Enter Portia with the Prince of Morocco and both their trains.

The first, of gold, who this inscription bears, \u201cWho chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.\u201d The second, silver, which this promise carries, \u201cWho chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\u201d This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt, \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d How shall I know if I do choose the right? PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, prince. If you choose that, then I am yours withal. PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see. I will survey the inscriptions back again. What says this leaden casket? \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead! This casket threatens; men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross, I\u2019ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. What says the silver with her virgin hue? \u201cWho chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\u201d As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand. If thou be\u2019st rated by thy estimation Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady.

But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word \u201cchoose\u201d! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\u2019d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none? NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lott\u2019ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come? PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection. NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. PORTIA. Ay, that\u2019s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\u2019d false with a smith. NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine. PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say \u201cAnd you will not have me, choose.\u201d He hears merry tales and smiles not.", " I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal\u2019d under for another. NERISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\u2019s nephew? PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him. NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father\u2019s will, if you should refuse to accept him. PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge. NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father\u2019s imposition, depending on the caskets. PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father\u2019s will.

I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost.

You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer\u2019d. BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife, And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it. PORTIA. That \u2019scuse serves many men to save their gifts.

Ay, his breast So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge? \u201cNearest his heart\u201d: those are the very words. PORTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh The flesh? SHYLOCK. I have them ready. PORTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death. SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond? PORTIA. It is not so express\u2019d, but what of that? \u2019Twere good you do so much for charity. SHYLOCK. I cannot find it; \u2019tis not in the bond. PORTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say? ANTONIO. But little. I am arm\u2019d and well prepar\u2019d. Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well, Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you, For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom: it is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty, from which ling\u2019ring penance Of such misery doth she cut me off.", " I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea, Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence \u2019gainst the merchant there. SHYLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, The penalty and forfeit of my bond. PORTIA. Is he not able to discharge the money? BASSANIO. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court, Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o\u2019er On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority. To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will. PORTIA. It must not be, there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established; \u2019Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state. It cannot be. SHYLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel! O wise young judge, how I do honour thee! PORTIA. I pray you let me look upon the bond. SHYLOCK. Here \u2019tis, most reverend doctor, here it is. PORTIA. Shylock, there\u2019s thrice thy money offered thee. SHYLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven. Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No, not for Venice. PORTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit, And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant\u2019s heart. Be merciful, Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond."], "Where does Portiainstruct her servant Balthasar to hurry?": [" And what\u2019s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction. Enter a man from Antonio. SERVANT. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you both. SALARINO. We have been up and down to seek him. Enter Tubal. SOLANIO.

Hast thou found my daughter? TUBAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her. SHYLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort!

Shylock thy master spoke with me this day, And hath preferr\u2019d thee, if it be preferment To leave a rich Jew\u2019s service to become The follower of so poor a gentleman. LAUNCELET. The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you have \u201cthe grace of God\u201d, sir, and he hath \u201cenough\u201d. BASSANIO. Thou speak\u2019st it well. Go, father, with thy son. Take leave of thy old master, and inquire My lodging out. [_To a Servant._] Give him a livery More guarded than his fellows\u2019; see it done. LAUNCELET. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne\u2019er a tongue in my head! [_Looking on his palm._] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune; go to, here\u2019s a simple line of life. Here\u2019s a small trifle of wives, alas, fifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed; here are simple \u2019scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she\u2019s a good wench for this gear. Father, come; I\u2019ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling. [_Exeunt Launcelet and Old Gobbo._] BASSANIO. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this. These things being bought and orderly bestow\u2019d, Return in haste, for I do feast tonight My best esteem\u2019d acquaintance; hie thee, go.", " To him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer. Enter Bassanio with Leonardo and a follower or two. BASSANIO. You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging. [_Exit a Servant._] LAUNCELET. To him, father. GOBBO. God bless your worship! BASSANIO. Gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me? GOBBO. Here\u2019s my son, sir, a poor boy. LAUNCELET. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew\u2019s man, that would, sir, as my father shall specify. GOBBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve. LAUNCELET. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify. GOBBO. His master and he (saving your worship\u2019s reverence) are scarce cater-cousins. LAUNCELET. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you. GOBBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and my suit is\u2014 LAUNCELET. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father. BASSANIO. One speak for both. What would you? LAUNCELET. Serve you, sir. GOBBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir. BASSANIO."], "What complaintdoes Launcelot make regarding the conversion of the Jews?": [" LAUNCELET. Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you are damn\u2019d. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither. JESSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee? LAUNCELET. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew\u2019s daughter. JESSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me. LAUNCELET. Truly then I fear you are damn\u2019d both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are gone both ways. JESSICA. I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian. LAUNCELET. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e\u2019en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money. Enter Lorenzo. JESSICA. I\u2019ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes. LORENZO. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into corners! JESSICA. Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly there\u2019s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew\u2019s daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.", " Enter Gratiano. GRATIANO. Fair sir, you are well o\u2019erta\u2019en. My Lord Bassanio upon more advice, Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat Your company at dinner. PORTIA. That cannot be; His ring I do accept most thankfully, And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock\u2019s house. GRATIANO. That will I do. NERISSA. Sir, I would speak with you. [_Aside to Portia_.] I\u2019ll see if I can get my husband\u2019s ring, Which I did make him swear to keep for ever. PORTIA. [_To Nerissa_.] Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men; But we\u2019ll outface them, and outswear them too. Away! make haste! Thou know\u2019st where I will tarry. NERISSA. Come, good sir, will you show me to this house? [_Exeunt._] ACT V SCENE I. Belmont. The avenue to Portia\u2019s house. Enter Lorenzo and Jessica. LORENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this, When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees, And they did make no noise, in such a night, Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls, And sigh\u2019d his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night. JESSICA. In such a night Did Thisby fearfully o\u2019ertrip the dew, And saw the lion\u2019s shadow ere himself, And ran dismay\u2019d away. LORENZO. In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love To come again to Carthage. JESSICA. In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old \u00c6son.", " It was my turquoise, I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. TUBAL. But Antonio is certainly undone. SHYLOCK. Nay, that\u2019s true, that\u2019s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.

There\u2019s something tells me (but it is not love) I would not lose you, and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality. But lest you should not understand me well,\u2014 And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,\u2014 I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me. I could teach you How to choose right, but then I am forsworn. So will I never be. So may you miss me. But if you do, you\u2019ll make me wish a sin, That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes, They have o\u2019erlook\u2019d me and divided me. One half of me is yours, the other half yours, Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours, And so all yours.

For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I\u2019ll pay it instantly with all my heart. BASSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself, But life itself, my wife, and all the world, Are not with me esteem\u2019d above thy life.

You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter\u2019s flight. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal. SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam. SHYLOCK. She is damn\u2019d for it. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, if the devil may be her judge. SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel! SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years? SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood. SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\u2019s that good for? SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac\u2019d me and hind\u2019red me half a million, laugh\u2019d at my losses, mock\u2019d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies.", " Commend me to your honourable wife, Tell her the process of Antonio\u2019s end, Say how I lov\u2019d you, speak me fair in death.

Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment. PORTIA. Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife. SHYLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man! PORTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond. SHYLOCK. \u2019Tis very true. O wise and upright judge, How much more elder art thou than thy looks! PORTIA. Therefore lay bare your bosom. SHYLOCK. Ay, his breast So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge? \u201cNearest his heart\u201d: those are the very words. PORTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh The flesh? SHYLOCK. I have them ready. PORTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death. SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond? PORTIA. It is not so express\u2019d, but what of that? \u2019Twere good you do so much for charity. SHYLOCK. I cannot find it; \u2019tis not in the bond. PORTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say? ANTONIO. But little. I am arm\u2019d and well prepar\u2019d. Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well, Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you, For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom: it is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty, from which ling\u2019ring penance Of such misery doth she cut me off.", " ANTONIO. Content, in faith, I\u2019ll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew. BASSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me, I\u2019ll rather dwell in my necessity. ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it, Within these two months, that\u2019s a month before This bond expires, I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond. SHYLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this, If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture? A pound of man\u2019s flesh, taken from a man, Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say, To buy his favour, I extend this friendship. If he will take it, so. If not, adieu, And for my love I pray you wrong me not. ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond. SHYLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary\u2019s, Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I\u2019ll be with you. ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew. [_Exit Shylock._] This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind. BASSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain\u2019s mind. ANTONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay; My ships come home a month before the day. [_Exeunt._] ACT II SCENE I. Belmont.", " Enter Shylock. How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants? SHYLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter\u2019s flight. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal. SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam. SHYLOCK. She is damn\u2019d for it. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, if the devil may be her judge. SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel! SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years? SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood. SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\u2019s that good for? SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac\u2019d me and hind\u2019red me half a million, laugh\u2019d at my losses, mock\u2019d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies.", " O love, dispatch all business and be gone! BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste; but, till I come again, No bed shall e\u2019er be guilty of my stay, Nor rest be interposer \u2019twixt us twain. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. Venice. A street. Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler. SHYLOCK. Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy. This is the fool that lent out money gratis. Gaoler, look to him. ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond, speak not against my bond. I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call\u2019dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But since I am a dog, beware my fangs; The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request. ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I\u2019ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I\u2019ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not, I\u2019ll have no speaking, I will have my bond. [_Exit._] SALARINO. It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men. ANTONIO. Let him alone. I\u2019ll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life, his reason well I know: I oft deliver\u2019d from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me. Therefore he hates me. SALARINO. I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold."], "How is Shylockpunished for seeking to take Antonio\u2019s life?": [" For half thy wealth, it is Antonio\u2019s; The other half comes to the general state, Which humbleness may drive unto a fine. PORTIA. Ay, for the state, not for Antonio. SHYLOCK. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that. You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house; you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live. PORTIA. What mercy can you render him, Antonio? GRATIANO. A halter gratis, nothing else, for God\u2019s sake! ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods, I am content, so he will let me have The other half in use, to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter. Two things provided more, that for this favour, He presently become a Christian; The other, that he do record a gift, Here in the court, of all he dies possess\u2019d Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter. DUKE. He shall do this, or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here. PORTIA. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say? SHYLOCK. I am content. PORTIA. Clerk, draw a deed of gift. SHYLOCK. I pray you give me leave to go from hence; I am not well; send the deed after me And I will sign it. DUKE. Get thee gone, but do it. GRATIANO. In christ\u2019ning shalt thou have two god-fathers. Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more, To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.

And when the tale is told, bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love. Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt. For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I\u2019ll pay it instantly with all my heart. BASSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself, But life itself, my wife, and all the world, Are not with me esteem\u2019d above thy life. I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil, to deliver you. PORTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer. GRATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love. I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew. NERISSA. \u2019Tis well you offer it behind her back, The wish would make else an unquiet house. SHYLOCK. These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter\u2014 Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband, rather than a Christian! We trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence. PORTIA. A pound of that same merchant\u2019s flesh is thine, The court awards it and the law doth give it. SHYLOCK. Most rightful judge! PORTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast. The law allows it and the court awards it. SHYLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence!", " SHYLOCK. Give me my principal, and let me go. BASSANIO. I have it ready for thee. Here it is. PORTIA. He hath refus\u2019d it in the open court, He shall have merely justice and his bond. GRATIANO. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel! I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word. SHYLOCK. Shall I not have barely my principal? PORTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril, Jew. SHYLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it! I\u2019ll stay no longer question. PORTIA. Tarry, Jew. The law hath yet another hold on you. It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party \u2019gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods; the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state, And the offender\u2019s life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only, \u2019gainst all other voice. In which predicament I say thou stand\u2019st; For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly, and directly too, Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr\u2019d The danger formerly by me rehears\u2019d. Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke. GRATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself, And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, Thou hast not left the value of a cord; Therefore thou must be hang\u2019d at the state\u2019s charge. DUKE. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.", " Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner. PORTIA. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon, I must away this night toward Padua, And it is meet I presently set forth. DUKE. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. Antonio, gratify this gentleman, For in my mind you are much bound to him. [_Exeunt Duke and his train._] BASSANIO. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof, Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew We freely cope your courteous pains withal. ANTONIO. And stand indebted, over and above In love and service to you evermore. PORTIA. He is well paid that is well satisfied, And I delivering you, am satisfied, And therein do account myself well paid, My mind was never yet more mercenary. I pray you know me when we meet again, I wish you well, and so I take my leave. BASSANIO. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further. Take some remembrance of us as a tribute, Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you, Not to deny me, and to pardon me. PORTIA. You press me far, and therefore I will yield. [_To Antonio_.] Give me your gloves, I\u2019ll wear them for your sake. [_To Bassanio_.] And, for your love, I\u2019ll take this ring from you. Do not draw back your hand; I\u2019ll take no more, And you in love shall not deny me this. BASSANIO. This ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle, I will not shame myself to give you this."], "What words doesShylock utter after accepting the court\u2019s sentence?": [" Commend me to your honourable wife, Tell her the process of Antonio\u2019s end, Say how I lov\u2019d you, speak me fair in death.

My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, The penalty and forfeit of my bond. PORTIA. Is he not able to discharge the money? BASSANIO. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court, Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o\u2019er On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority. To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will. PORTIA. It must not be, there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established; \u2019Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state. It cannot be. SHYLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel! O wise young judge, how I do honour thee! PORTIA. I pray you let me look upon the bond. SHYLOCK. Here \u2019tis, most reverend doctor, here it is. PORTIA. Shylock, there\u2019s thrice thy money offered thee. SHYLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven. Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No, not for Venice. PORTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit, And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant\u2019s heart. Be merciful, Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.", " PORTIA. We have been praying for our husbands\u2019 welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words. Are they return\u2019d?

We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not. PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick, It looks a little paler. \u2019Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid. Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers. BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun. PORTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light, For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, And never be Bassanio so for me. But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord. BASSANIO. I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend. This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound. PORTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him, For, as I hear, he was much bound for you. ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of. PORTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house. It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. GRATIANO.

A carrion Death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll. I\u2019ll read the writing. _All that glisters is not gold, Often have you heard that told. Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold. Gilded tombs do worms infold.

The villain Jew with outcries rais\u2019d the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio\u2019s ship. SALARINO. He came too late, the ship was under sail; But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica. Besides, Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship. SOLANIO. I never heard a passion so confus\u2019d, So strange, outrageous, and so variable As the dog Jew did utter in the streets. \u201cMy daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!

NERISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, Unless he live until he be a man. BASSANIO. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow. When I am absent, then lie with my wife. ANTONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living; For here I read for certain that my ships Are safely come to road. PORTIA. How now, Lorenzo! My clerk hath some good comforts too for you. NERISSA. Ay, and I\u2019ll give them him without a fee. There do I give to you and Jessica, From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift, After his death, of all he dies possess\u2019d of. LORENZO.

Let us go in, And charge us there upon inter\u2019gatories, And we will answer all things faithfully. GRATIANO. Let it be so. The first inter\u2019gatory That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is, Whether till the next night she had rather stay, Or go to bed now, being two hours to day. But were the day come, I should wish it dark Till I were couching with the doctor\u2019s clerk.

What should I say, sweet lady? I was enforc\u2019d to send it after him. I was beset with shame and courtesy. My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it.

I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it; And if it stand, as you yourself still do, Within the eye of honour, be assur\u2019d My purse, my person, my extremest means Lie all unlock\u2019d to your occasions. BASSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way, with more advised watch To find the other forth; and by adventuring both I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost. But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first. ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance; And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have. Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak. BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu\u2019d To Cato\u2019s daughter, Brutus\u2019 Portia. Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\u2019 strond, And many Jasons come in quest of her.", " O my Antonio, had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate. ANTONIO. Thou know\u2019st that all my fortunes are at sea; Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum, therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do; That shall be rack\u2019d even to the uttermost, To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia. Go presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is, and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia\u2019s house. Enter Portia with her waiting-woman Nerissa. PORTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world. NERISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer. PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc\u2019d. NERISSA. They would be better if well followed. PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men\u2019s cottages princes\u2019 palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.", " SOLANIO. I think he only loves the world for him. I pray thee, let us go and find him out And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other. SALARINO. Do we so. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in Portia\u2019s house. Enter Nerissa and a Servitor. NERISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight. The Prince of Arragon hath ta\u2019en his oath, And comes to his election presently. Flourish of cornets. Enter the Prince of Arragon, his train, and Portia. PORTIA. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince, If you choose that wherein I am contain\u2019d, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz\u2019d. But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately. ARRAGON. I am enjoin\u2019d by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to anyone Which casket \u2019twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; Lastly, If I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you and be gone. PORTIA. To these injunctions everyone doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self. ARRAGON. And so have I address\u2019d me. Fortune now To my heart\u2019s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard. What says the golden chest? Ha! let me see: \u201cWho chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.\u201d What many men desire!"], "What does Portiavow to do when she learns that Bassanio no longer has the ring shegave him?": [" BASSANIO. [_Aside._] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off, And swear I lost the ring defending it. GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg\u2019d it, and indeed Deserv\u2019d it too. And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begg\u2019d mine, And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings. PORTIA. What ring gave you, my lord? Not that, I hope, which you receiv\u2019d of me. BASSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it, but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone. PORTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth. By heaven, I will ne\u2019er come in your bed Until I see the ring. NERISSA. Nor I in yours Till I again see mine! BASSANIO. Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring, When nought would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure. PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas\u2019d to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony? Nerissa teaches me what to believe: I\u2019ll die for\u2019t but some woman had the ring.", " PORTIA. I will have nothing else but only this, And now methinks I have a mind to it. BASSANIO. There\u2019s more depends on this than on the value. The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation, Only for this I pray you pardon me. PORTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers. You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer\u2019d. BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife, And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it. PORTIA. That \u2019scuse serves many men to save their gifts. And if your wife be not a mad-woman, And know how well I have deserv\u2019d this ring, She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you! [_Exeunt Portia and Nerissa._] ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring. Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued \u2019gainst your wife\u2019s commandment. BASSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him; Give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst Unto Antonio\u2019s house. Away, make haste. [_Exit Gratiano._] Come, you and I will thither presently, And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. The same. A street. Enter Portia and Nerissa. PORTIA. Inquire the Jew\u2019s house out, give him this deed, And let him sign it, we\u2019ll away tonight, And be a day before our husbands home. This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.", " Mark you but that! In both my eyes he doubly sees himself, In each eye one. Swear by your double self, And there\u2019s an oath of credit. BASSANIO. Nay, but hear me. Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee. ANTONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth, Which but for him that had your husband\u2019s ring Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again, My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly. PORTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this, And bid him keep it better than the other. ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring. BASSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor! PORTIA. I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio, For by this ring, the doctor lay with me. NERISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano, For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor\u2019s clerk, In lieu of this, last night did lie with me. GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways In summer, where the ways are fair enough. What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv\u2019d it? PORTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz\u2019d. Here is a letter; read it at your leisure. It comes from Padua from Bellario. There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you, And even but now return\u2019d. I have not yet Enter\u2019d my house. Antonio, you are welcome, And I have better news in store for you Than you expect: unseal this letter soon.", " To him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer. Enter Bassanio with Leonardo and a follower or two. BASSANIO. You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging. [_Exit a Servant._] LAUNCELET. To him, father. GOBBO. God bless your worship! BASSANIO. Gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me? GOBBO. Here\u2019s my son, sir, a poor boy. LAUNCELET. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew\u2019s man, that would, sir, as my father shall specify. GOBBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve. LAUNCELET. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify. GOBBO. His master and he (saving your worship\u2019s reverence) are scarce cater-cousins. LAUNCELET. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you. GOBBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and my suit is\u2014 LAUNCELET. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father. BASSANIO. One speak for both.

No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee, Thou spend\u2019st such high-day wit in praising him. Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see Quick Cupid\u2019s post that comes so mannerly. NERISSA. Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be! [_Exeunt._] ACT III SCENE I. Venice. A street. Enter Solanio and Salarino. SOLANIO. Now, what news on the Rialto? SALARINO. Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack\u2019d on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word. SOLANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,\u2014O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!\u2014 SALARINO. Come, the full stop. SOLANIO. Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship. SALARINO. I would it might prove the end of his losses. SOLANIO.

We\u2019ll make our leisures to attend on yours. [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._] LORENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you, but at dinner-time I pray you have in mind where we must meet. BASSANIO. I will not fail you. GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio, You have too much respect upon the world. They lose it that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang\u2019d. ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano, A stage, where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one. GRATIANO. Let me play the fool, With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio, (I love thee, and \u2019tis my love that speaks): There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, And do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be dress\u2019d in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, As who should say, \u201cI am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\u201d O my Antonio, I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, If they should speak, would almost damn those ears Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.", " GRATIANO.

But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee, And, Launcelet, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master\u2019s guest. Give him this letter, do it secretly. And so farewell. I would not have my father See me in talk with thee. LAUNCELET. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, adieu! These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit. Adieu! JESSICA. Farewell, good Launcelet. [_Exit Launcelet._] Alack, what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father\u2019s child! But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners.

I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so?

Fourscore ducats! TUBAL. There came divers of Antonio\u2019s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break. SHYLOCK. I am very glad of it. I\u2019ll plague him, I\u2019ll torture him. I am glad of it. TUBAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey. SHYLOCK. Out upon her!

And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him. NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father\u2019s will, if you should refuse to accept him. PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge. NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father\u2019s imposition, depending on the caskets. PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father\u2019s will.

JESSICA. Call you? What is your will? SHYLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica. There are my keys. But wherefore should I go? I am not bid for love, they flatter me. But yet I\u2019ll go in hate, to feed upon The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loath to go; There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money-bags tonight. LAUNCELET. I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach. SHYLOCK. So do I his. LAUNCELET. And they have conspired together. I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o\u2019clock i\u2019 th\u2019 morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in th\u2019 afternoon. SHYLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica, Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry-neck\u2019d fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnish\u2019d faces, But stop my house\u2019s ears, I mean my casements.", " Enter Shylock. How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants? SHYLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter\u2019s flight. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal. SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam. SHYLOCK. She is damn\u2019d for it. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, if the devil may be her judge. SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel! SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years? SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood. SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\u2019s that good for? SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac\u2019d me and hind\u2019red me half a million, laugh\u2019d at my losses, mock\u2019d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies.", " Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And I know not what\u2019s spent in the search. Why, thou\u2014loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o\u2019 my shoulders, no sighs but o\u2019 my breathing, no tears but o\u2019 my shedding. TUBAL. Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa\u2014 SHYLOCK. What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck? TUBAL. \u2014hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis. SHYLOCK. I thank God! I thank God! Is it true, is it true? TUBAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack. SHYLOCK. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa? TUBAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats. SHYLOCK. Thou stick\u2019st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats! TUBAL. There came divers of Antonio\u2019s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break. SHYLOCK. I am very glad of it. I\u2019ll plague him, I\u2019ll torture him. I am glad of it. TUBAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey. SHYLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal.", " LAUNCELET. Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you are damn\u2019d. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither. JESSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee? LAUNCELET. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew\u2019s daughter. JESSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me. LAUNCELET. Truly then I fear you are damn\u2019d both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are gone both ways. JESSICA. I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian. LAUNCELET. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e\u2019en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money. Enter Lorenzo. JESSICA. I\u2019ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes. LORENZO. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into corners! JESSICA. Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly there\u2019s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew\u2019s daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork."], "In order to marry Portia, suitors must choose one of three caskets. What is the correct casket made of?": [" The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\u2019er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\u2019er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word \u201cchoose\u201d! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\u2019d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none? NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lott\u2019ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come? PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection. NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. PORTIA. Ay, that\u2019s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\u2019d false with a smith. NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine. PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say \u201cAnd you will not have me, choose.\u201d He hears merry tales and smiles not.", " I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal\u2019d under for another. NERISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\u2019s nephew? PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him. NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father\u2019s will, if you should refuse to accept him. PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge. NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father\u2019s imposition, depending on the caskets. PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father\u2019s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.", " SOLANIO.

But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately. ARRAGON. I am enjoin\u2019d by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to anyone Which casket \u2019twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; Lastly, If I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you and be gone. PORTIA. To these injunctions everyone doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self. ARRAGON. And so have I address\u2019d me. Fortune now To my heart\u2019s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead. \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard. What says the golden chest?

PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, prince. If you choose that, then I am yours withal. PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see. I will survey the inscriptions back again. What says this leaden casket? \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead! This casket threatens; men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross, I\u2019ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead. What says the silver with her virgin hue? \u201cWho chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\u201d As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco, And weigh thy value with an even hand. If thou be\u2019st rated by thy estimation Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady. And yet to be afeard of my deserving Were but a weak disabling of myself."], "What does Portia give Bassanio as a token of her love?": [" PORTIA. I will have nothing else but only this, And now methinks I have a mind to it. BASSANIO. There\u2019s more depends on this than on the value. The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation, Only for this I pray you pardon me. PORTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers. You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer\u2019d. BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife, And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it. PORTIA. That \u2019scuse serves many men to save their gifts. And if your wife be not a mad-woman, And know how well I have deserv\u2019d this ring, She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!

Give order to my servants, that they take No note at all of our being absent hence, Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you. [_A tucket sounds._] LORENZO. Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet. We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not. PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick, It looks a little paler. \u2019Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid. Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers. BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun. PORTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light, For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, And never be Bassanio so for me. But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord. BASSANIO. I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend. This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound. PORTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him, For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love. BASSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust, Which makes me fear th\u2019 enjoying of my love. There may as well be amity and life \u2019Tween snow and fire as treason and my love. PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything. BASSANIO.

Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end, Fading in music. That the comparison May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream And wat\u2019ry death-bed for him. He may win, And what is music then?

Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it, Within these two months, that\u2019s a month before This bond expires, I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond. SHYLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this, If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture?

For wooing here until I sweat again, And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love, at last, (if promise last) I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love, provided that your fortune Achiev\u2019d her mistress.

I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\u2019d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none? NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lott\u2019ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come? PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection. NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. PORTIA. Ay, that\u2019s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\u2019d false with a smith. NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine. PORTIA.

Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice By being peevish?

We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not. PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick, It looks a little paler. \u2019Tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid. Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers. BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun. PORTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light, For a light wife doth make a heavy husband, And never be Bassanio so for me. But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord. BASSANIO. I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend. This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound. PORTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him, For, as I hear, he was much bound for you. ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of. PORTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house. It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. GRATIANO.

How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\u2019s nephew? PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him. NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father\u2019s will, if you should refuse to accept him. PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge. NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father\u2019s imposition, depending on the caskets. PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father\u2019s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.", " Say, when?

Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio, (I love thee, and \u2019tis my love that speaks): There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, And do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be dress\u2019d in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, As who should say, \u201cI am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\u201d O my Antonio, I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, If they should speak, would almost damn those ears Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.", " PORTIA.

Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack\u2019d on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word. SOLANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,\u2014O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!\u2014 SALARINO. Come, the full stop. SOLANIO. Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship. SALARINO. I would it might prove the end of his losses. SOLANIO.

And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself. SALARINO. Your mind is tossing on the ocean, There where your argosies, with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or as it were the pageants of the sea, Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven wings. SOLANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, Peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads; And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt Would make me sad. SALARINO. My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea. I should not see the sandy hour-glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats, And see my wealthy Andrew dock\u2019d in sand, Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial. Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which, touching but my gentle vessel\u2019s side, Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing?", " O love, dispatch all business and be gone!

Gaoler, look to him. ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond, speak not against my bond. I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call\u2019dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But since I am a dog, beware my fangs; The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request. ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I\u2019ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I\u2019ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not, I\u2019ll have no speaking, I will have my bond. [_Exit._] SALARINO. It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men. ANTONIO. Let him alone. I\u2019ll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life, his reason well I know: I oft deliver\u2019d from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me. Therefore he hates me. SALARINO. I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.", " DUKE. You are welcome. Take your place. Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court? PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause. Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew? DUKE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth. PORTIA. Is your name Shylock? SHYLOCK. Shylock is my name. PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow, Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed. [_To Antonio_.] You stand within his danger, do you not? ANTONIO. Ay, so he says. PORTIA. Do you confess the bond? ANTONIO. I do. PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful. SHYLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that. PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain\u2019d, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. \u2019Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown. His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God\u2019s When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy, And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy."], "What is one of Antonio\u2019s key characteristics, other than melancholy?": [" I\u2019ll tell thee more of this another time.

If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap\u2019ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him. NERISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England? PORTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man\u2019s picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere. NERISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour? PORTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able."], "What do the Christian characters in the play embody?": [" And what\u2019s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction. Enter a man from Antonio. SERVANT. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you both. SALARINO. We have been up and down to seek him. Enter Tubal. SOLANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match\u2019d, unless the devil himself turn Jew. [_Exeunt Solanio, Salarino and the Servant._] SHYLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter? TUBAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her. SHYLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till now.", " GRATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest, But we will visit you at supper-time. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. The same. A room in Shylock\u2019s house. Enter Jessica and Launcelet. JESSICA. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so. Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness. But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee, And, Launcelet, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master\u2019s guest. Give him this letter, do it secretly. And so farewell. I would not have my father See me in talk with thee. LAUNCELET. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, adieu! These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit. Adieu! JESSICA. Farewell, good Launcelet. [_Exit Launcelet._] Alack, what heinous sin is it in me To be ashamed to be my father\u2019s child! But though I am a daughter to his blood, I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo, If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, Become a Christian and thy loving wife. [_Exit._] SCENE IV. The same. A street. Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino and Solanio. LORENZO. Nay, we will slink away in supper-time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return All in an hour. GRATIANO. We have not made good preparation. SALARINO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers. SOLANIO. \u2019Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order\u2019d, And better in my mind not undertook.", " Say, when? You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so? SALARINO. We\u2019ll make our leisures to attend on yours. [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._] LORENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you, but at dinner-time I pray you have in mind where we must meet. BASSANIO. I will not fail you. GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio, You have too much respect upon the world. They lose it that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang\u2019d. ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano, A stage, where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one. GRATIANO. Let me play the fool, With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio, (I love thee, and \u2019tis my love that speaks): There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, And do a wilful stillness entertain, With purpose to be dress\u2019d in an opinion Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, As who should say, \u201cI am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.\u201d O my Antonio, I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, If they should speak, would almost damn those ears Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.", " Commend me to your honourable wife, Tell her the process of Antonio\u2019s end, Say how I lov\u2019d you, speak me fair in death. And when the tale is told, bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love. Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt. For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I\u2019ll pay it instantly with all my heart. BASSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself, But life itself, my wife, and all the world, Are not with me esteem\u2019d above thy life. I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil, to deliver you. PORTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer. GRATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love. I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew. NERISSA. \u2019Tis well you offer it behind her back, The wish would make else an unquiet house. SHYLOCK. These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter\u2014 Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband, rather than a Christian! We trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence. PORTIA. A pound of that same merchant\u2019s flesh is thine, The court awards it and the law doth give it. SHYLOCK. Most rightful judge! PORTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast. The law allows it and the court awards it. SHYLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence!"], "What issue causes the conflict between Shylock and the Christian characters to come to a head?": [" Enter Shylock. How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants? SHYLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter\u2019s flight. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal. SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam. SHYLOCK. She is damn\u2019d for it. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, if the devil may be her judge. SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel! SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years? SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood. SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\u2019s that good for? SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac\u2019d me and hind\u2019red me half a million, laugh\u2019d at my losses, mock\u2019d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies.", " [_Exeunt._] SCENE V. The same. Before Shylock\u2019s house. Enter Shylock the Jew and Launcelet his man that was the clown. SHYLOCK. Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.\u2014 What, Jessica!\u2014Thou shalt not gormandize As thou hast done with me;\u2014What, Jessica!\u2014 And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out. Why, Jessica, I say! LAUNCELET. Why, Jessica! SHYLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call. LAUNCELET. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding. Enter Jessica. JESSICA. Call you? What is your will? SHYLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica. There are my keys. But wherefore should I go? I am not bid for love, they flatter me. But yet I\u2019ll go in hate, to feed upon The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loath to go; There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money-bags tonight. LAUNCELET. I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach. SHYLOCK. So do I his. LAUNCELET. And they have conspired together. I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o\u2019clock i\u2019 th\u2019 morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in th\u2019 afternoon. SHYLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica, Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry-neck\u2019d fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnish\u2019d faces, But stop my house\u2019s ears, I mean my casements.", " O love, dispatch all business and be gone! BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste; but, till I come again, No bed shall e\u2019er be guilty of my stay, Nor rest be interposer \u2019twixt us twain. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. Venice. A street. Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler. SHYLOCK. Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy. This is the fool that lent out money gratis. Gaoler, look to him. ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond, speak not against my bond. I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call\u2019dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But since I am a dog, beware my fangs; The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request. ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I\u2019ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I\u2019ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not, I\u2019ll have no speaking, I will have my bond. [_Exit._] SALARINO. It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men. ANTONIO. Let him alone. I\u2019ll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life, his reason well I know: I oft deliver\u2019d from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me. Therefore he hates me. SALARINO. I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.", " I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea, Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence \u2019gainst the merchant there. SHYLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, The penalty and forfeit of my bond. PORTIA. Is he not able to discharge the money? BASSANIO. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court, Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o\u2019er On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority. To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will. PORTIA. It must not be, there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established; \u2019Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state. It cannot be. SHYLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel! O wise young judge, how I do honour thee! PORTIA. I pray you let me look upon the bond. SHYLOCK. Here \u2019tis, most reverend doctor, here it is. PORTIA. Shylock, there\u2019s thrice thy money offered thee. SHYLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven. Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No, not for Venice. PORTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit, And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant\u2019s heart. Be merciful, Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond."], "In the play, what breaks the cycle of insults, injuries and revenge that traps Shylock and the Christian characters together?": [" And what\u2019s his reason?

Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment. PORTIA. Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife. SHYLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man! PORTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond. SHYLOCK. \u2019Tis very true.

There\u2019s more depends on this than on the value. The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation, Only for this I pray you pardon me. PORTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers. You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer\u2019d. BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife, And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it. PORTIA. That \u2019scuse serves many men to save their gifts. And if your wife be not a mad-woman, And know how well I have deserv\u2019d this ring, She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!

In sooth I know not why I am so sad, It wearies me. you say it wearies you; But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, What stuff \u2019tis made of, whereof it is born, I am to learn. And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, That I have much ado to know myself. SALARINO. Your mind is tossing on the ocean, There where your argosies, with portly sail Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, Or as it were the pageants of the sea, Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them, do them reverence, As they fly by them with their woven wings. SOLANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, Peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads; And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt Would make me sad. SALARINO. My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea. I should not see the sandy hour-glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats, And see my wealthy Andrew dock\u2019d in sand, Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial. Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, Which, touching but my gentle vessel\u2019s side, Would scatter all her spices on the stream, Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, And, in a word, but even now worth this, And now worth nothing?", " O hell! what have we here? A carrion Death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll. I\u2019ll read the writing. _All that glisters is not gold, Often have you heard that told. Many a man his life hath sold But my outside to behold. Gilded tombs do worms infold. Had you been as wise as bold, Young in limbs, in judgment old, Your answer had not been inscroll\u2019d, Fare you well, your suit is cold._ Cold indeed and labour lost, Then farewell heat, and welcome frost. Portia, adieu! I have too griev\u2019d a heart To take a tedious leave. Thus losers part. [_Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets._] PORTIA. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go. Let all of his complexion choose me so. [_Exeunt._] SCENE VIII. Venice. A street. Enter Salarino and Solanio. SALARINO. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail; With him is Gratiano gone along; And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not. SOLANIO. The villain Jew with outcries rais\u2019d the Duke, Who went with him to search Bassanio\u2019s ship. SALARINO. He came too late, the ship was under sail; But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica. Besides, Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship. SOLANIO. I never heard a passion so confus\u2019d, So strange, outrageous, and so variable As the dog Jew did utter in the streets. \u201cMy daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter! Fled with a Christian!", " Shall I have the thought To think on this, and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanc\u2019d would make me sad? But tell not me, I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise. ANTONIO. Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it, My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year. Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad. SALARINO. Why then you are in love. ANTONIO. Fie, fie! SALARINO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry; and \u2019twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram\u2019d strange fellows in her time: Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper. And other of such vinegar aspect That they\u2019ll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable. Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and Gratiano. SOLANIO. Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well. We leave you now with better company. SALARINO. I would have stay\u2019d till I had made you merry, If worthier friends had not prevented me. ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard. I take it your own business calls on you, And you embrace th\u2019 occasion to depart. SALARINO. Good morrow, my good lords. BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh?"], "What aspect of Gratiano does Bassanio joke about after Gratiano has left?": [" LEONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein. Enter Gratiano. GRATIANO. Where\u2019s your master? LEONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks. [_Exit._] GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio! BASSANIO. Gratiano! GRATIANO. I have suit to you. BASSANIO. You have obtain\u2019d it. GRATIANO. You must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont. BASSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano, Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice, Parts that become thee happily enough, And in such eyes as ours appear not faults; But where thou art not known, why there they show Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour I be misconst\u2019red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes. GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me. If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect, and swear but now and then, Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say \u201camen\u201d; Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more. BASSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing. GRATIANO. Nay, but I bar tonight, you shall not gauge me By what we do tonight. BASSANIO. No, that were pity. I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment. But fare you well, I have some business.", " I\u2019ll tell thee more of this another time. But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon, this opinion. Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while. I\u2019ll end my exhortation after dinner. LORENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time. I must be one of these same dumb wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak. GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue. ANTONIO. Fare you well. I\u2019ll grow a talker for this gear. GRATIANO. Thanks, i\u2019 faith, for silence is only commendable In a neat\u2019s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible. [_Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo._] ANTONIO. Is that anything now? BASSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the search. ANTONIO. Well, tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you today promis\u2019d to tell me of? BASSANIO. \u2019Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance. Nor do I now make moan to be abridg\u2019d From such a noble rate, but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag\u2019d. To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love, And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe.", " And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too. BASSANIO. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife. GRATIANO. I thank your lordship, you have got me one. My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours: You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid. You lov\u2019d, I lov\u2019d; for intermission No more pertains to me, my lord, than you. Your fortune stood upon the caskets there, And so did mine too, as the matter falls. For wooing here until I sweat again, And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love, at last, (if promise last) I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love, provided that your fortune Achiev\u2019d her mistress. PORTIA. Is this true, Nerissa? NERISSA. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas\u2019d withal. BASSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith? GRATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord. BASSANIO. Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage. GRATIANO. We\u2019ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats. NERISSA. What! and stake down? GRATIANO. No, we shall ne\u2019er win at that sport and stake down. But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio! Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and Salerio. BASSANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither, If that the youth of my new int\u2019rest here Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave, I bid my very friends and countrymen, Sweet Portia, welcome.", " Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer. JESSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames? They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light. Why, \u2019tis an office of discovery, love, And I should be obscur\u2019d. LORENZO. So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. But come at once, For the close night doth play the runaway, And we are stay\u2019d for at Bassanio\u2019s feast. JESSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself With some moe ducats, and be with you straight. [_Exit above._] GRATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew. LORENZO. Beshrew me but I love her heartily, For she is wise, if I can judge of her, And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true, And true she is, as she hath prov\u2019d herself. And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, Shall she be placed in my constant soul. Enter Jessica. What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away! Our masquing mates by this time for us stay. [_Exit with Jessica and Salarino._] Enter Antonio. ANTONIO. Who\u2019s there? GRATIANO. Signior Antonio! ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest? \u2019Tis nine o\u2019clock, our friends all stay for you. No masque tonight, the wind is come about; Bassanio presently will go aboard. I have sent twenty out to seek for you. GRATIANO. I am glad on\u2019t. I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight. [_Exeunt._] SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in Portia\u2019s house.

ANTONIO. Thou know\u2019st that all my fortunes are at sea; Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum, therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do; That shall be rack\u2019d even to the uttermost, To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.

You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer. PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc\u2019d. NERISSA. They would be better if well followed. PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men\u2019s cottages princes\u2019 palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.", " PORTIA. I will have nothing else but only this, And now methinks I have a mind to it. BASSANIO. There\u2019s more depends on this than on the value.

You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer\u2019d. BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife, And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it. PORTIA. That \u2019scuse serves many men to save their gifts.

Dramatis Person\u00e6 THE DUKE OF VENICE THE PRINCE OF MOROCCO, suitor to Portia THE PRINCE OF ARRAGON, suitor to Portia ANTONIO, a merchant of Venice BASSANIO, his friend, suitor to Portia GRATIANO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio SOLANIO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio SALARINO, friend to Antonio and Bassanio LORENZO, in love with Jessica SHYLOCK, a rich Jew TUBAL, a Jew, his friend LAUNCELET GOBBO, a clown, servant to Shylock OLD GOBBO, father to Launcelet LEONARDO, servant to Bassanio BALTHAZAR, servant to Portia STEPHANO, servant to Portia SALERIO, a messenger from Venice PORTIA, a rich heiress NERISSA, her waiting-woman JESSICA, daughter to Shylock Magnificoes of Venice, Officers of the Court of Justice, a Gaoler, Servants and other Attendants SCENE: Partly at Venice, and partly at Belmont, the seat of Portia on the Continent ACT I SCENE I. Venice."], "In an aside, what does Shylock confess?": [" And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so, Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I. I speak too long, but \u2019tis to peise the time, To eche it, and to draw it out in length, To stay you from election. BASSANIO. Let me choose, For as I am, I live upon the rack. PORTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love. BASSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust, Which makes me fear th\u2019 enjoying of my love. There may as well be amity and life \u2019Tween snow and fire as treason and my love. PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything. BASSANIO. Promise me life, and I\u2019ll confess the truth. PORTIA. Well then, confess and live. BASSANIO. \u201cConfess and love\u201d Had been the very sum of my confession: O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance! But let me to my fortune and the caskets. PORTIA. Away, then! I am lock\u2019d in one of them. If you do love me, you will find me out. Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof. Let music sound while he doth make his choice. Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end, Fading in music. That the comparison May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream And wat\u2019ry death-bed for him. He may win, And what is music then? Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new-crowned monarch. Such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom\u2019s ear And summon him to marriage.", " DUKE. You are welcome. Take your place. Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court? PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause. Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew? DUKE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth. PORTIA. Is your name Shylock? SHYLOCK. Shylock is my name. PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow, Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed. [_To Antonio_.] You stand within his danger, do you not? ANTONIO. Ay, so he says. PORTIA. Do you confess the bond? ANTONIO. I do. PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful. SHYLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that. PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain\u2019d, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. \u2019Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown. His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God\u2019s When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy, And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy.", " Enter Shylock. How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants? SHYLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter\u2019s flight. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal. SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam. SHYLOCK. She is damn\u2019d for it. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, if the devil may be her judge. SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel! SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years? SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood. SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\u2019s that good for? SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac\u2019d me and hind\u2019red me half a million, laugh\u2019d at my losses, mock\u2019d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies.", " SHYLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour. It doth appear you are a worthy judge; You know the law; your exposition Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law, Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar, Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me. I stay here on my bond. ANTONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment. PORTIA. Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife. SHYLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man! PORTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty, Which here appeareth due upon the bond. SHYLOCK. \u2019Tis very true. O wise and upright judge, How much more elder art thou than thy looks! PORTIA. Therefore lay bare your bosom. SHYLOCK. Ay, his breast So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge? \u201cNearest his heart\u201d: those are the very words. PORTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh The flesh? SHYLOCK. I have them ready. PORTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death. SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond? PORTIA. It is not so express\u2019d, but what of that? \u2019Twere good you do so much for charity. SHYLOCK. I cannot find it; \u2019tis not in the bond. PORTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say? ANTONIO. But little. I am arm\u2019d and well prepar\u2019d. Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well, Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you, For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom: it is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty, from which ling\u2019ring penance Of such misery doth she cut me off."], "What is it that Antonio criticizes and that Shylock does as a regular business practice?": [" O love, dispatch all business and be gone! BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste; but, till I come again, No bed shall e\u2019er be guilty of my stay, Nor rest be interposer \u2019twixt us twain. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. Venice. A street. Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler. SHYLOCK. Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy. This is the fool that lent out money gratis. Gaoler, look to him. ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond, speak not against my bond. I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond. Thou call\u2019dst me dog before thou hadst a cause, But since I am a dog, beware my fangs; The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request. ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I\u2019ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I\u2019ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors. Follow not, I\u2019ll have no speaking, I will have my bond. [_Exit._] SALARINO. It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men. ANTONIO. Let him alone. I\u2019ll follow him no more with bootless prayers. He seeks my life, his reason well I know: I oft deliver\u2019d from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me. Therefore he hates me. SALARINO. I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.", " If I can catch him once upon the hip, I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him! BASSANIO. Shylock, do you hear? SHYLOCK. I am debating of my present store, And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me. But soft! how many months Do you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior, Your worship was the last man in our mouths. ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I\u2019ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess\u2019d How much ye would? SHYLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats. ANTONIO. And for three months. SHYLOCK. I had forgot, three months, you told me so. Well then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you, Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage. ANTONIO. I do never use it. SHYLOCK. When Jacob graz\u2019d his uncle Laban\u2019s sheep,\u2014 This Jacob from our holy Abram was As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor; ay, he was the third. ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest? SHYLOCK. No, not take interest, not, as you would say, Directly interest; mark what Jacob did.", " Enter Shylock.

The same. Before Shylock\u2019s house. Enter Shylock the Jew and Launcelet his man that was the clown. SHYLOCK. Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge, The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.\u2014 What, Jessica!\u2014Thou shalt not gormandize As thou hast done with me;\u2014What, Jessica!\u2014 And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out. Why, Jessica, I say! LAUNCELET. Why, Jessica! SHYLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call. LAUNCELET. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding. Enter Jessica. JESSICA. Call you? What is your will? SHYLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica. There are my keys. But wherefore should I go? I am not bid for love, they flatter me. But yet I\u2019ll go in hate, to feed upon The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl, Look to my house. I am right loath to go; There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money-bags tonight. LAUNCELET. I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach. SHYLOCK. So do I his. LAUNCELET. And they have conspired together. I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o\u2019clock i\u2019 th\u2019 morning, falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in th\u2019 afternoon. SHYLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica, Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry-neck\u2019d fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnish\u2019d faces, But stop my house\u2019s ears, I mean my casements.", " ANTONIO. Content, in faith, I\u2019ll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew. BASSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me, I\u2019ll rather dwell in my necessity. ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it, Within these two months, that\u2019s a month before This bond expires, I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond. SHYLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this, If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture? A pound of man\u2019s flesh, taken from a man, Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say, To buy his favour, I extend this friendship. If he will take it, so. If not, adieu, And for my love I pray you wrong me not. ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond. SHYLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary\u2019s, Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I\u2019ll be with you. ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew. [_Exit Shylock._] This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind. BASSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain\u2019s mind. ANTONIO.

Yes, here I tender it for him in the court, Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o\u2019er On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority. To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will. PORTIA. It must not be, there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established; \u2019Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state. It cannot be.

Be merciful, Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond."], "How does Bassanio feel about the arrangement and the conditions of the loan?": [" Look on beauty, And you shall see \u2019tis purchas\u2019d by the weight, Which therein works a miracle in nature, Making them lightest that wear most of it: So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness, often known To be the dowry of a second head, The skull that bred them in the sepulchre. Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest. Therefore thou gaudy gold, Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee, Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge \u2019Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead, Which rather threaten\u2019st than dost promise aught, Thy palenness moves me more than eloquence, And here choose I, joy be the consequence! PORTIA. [_Aside._] How all the other passions fleet to air, As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac\u2019d despair, And shudd\u2019ring fear, and green-ey\u2019d jealousy. O love, be moderate; allay thy ecstasy, In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess! I feel too much thy blessing, make it less, For fear I surfeit. BASSANIO. What find I here? [_Opening the leaden casket_.] Fair Portia\u2019s counterfeit! What demi-god Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes? Or whether, riding on the balls of mine, Seem they in motion? Here are sever\u2019d lips, Parted with sugar breath, so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends.", " LEONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein. Enter Gratiano. GRATIANO. Where\u2019s your master? LEONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks. [_Exit._] GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio! BASSANIO. Gratiano! GRATIANO. I have suit to you. BASSANIO. You have obtain\u2019d it. GRATIANO. You must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont. BASSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano, Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice, Parts that become thee happily enough, And in such eyes as ours appear not faults; But where thou art not known, why there they show Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour I be misconst\u2019red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes. GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me. If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect, and swear but now and then, Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say \u201camen\u201d; Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more. BASSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing. GRATIANO. Nay, but I bar tonight, you shall not gauge me By what we do tonight. BASSANIO. No, that were pity. I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment. But fare you well, I have some business.", " PORTIA. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble? BASSANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, The best condition\u2019d and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies, and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy. PORTIA. What sum owes he the Jew? BASSANIO. For me three thousand ducats. PORTIA. What, no more? Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond. Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio\u2019s fault. First go with me to church and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend. For never shall you lie by Portia\u2019s side With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over. When it is paid, bring your true friend along. My maid Nerissa and myself meantime, Will live as maids and widows. Come, away! For you shall hence upon your wedding day. Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer; Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear. But let me hear the letter of your friend. BASSANIO. _Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are clear\u2019d between you and I, if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter._ PORTIA.", " PORTIA. So do I, my lord, They are entirely welcome. LORENZO. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord, My purpose was not to have seen you here, But meeting with Salerio by the way, He did entreat me, past all saying nay, To come with him along. SALERIO. I did, my lord, And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio Commends him to you. [_Gives Bassanio a letter._] BASSANIO. Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth. SALERIO. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind, Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there Will show you his estate. [_Bassanio opens the letter._] GRATIANO. Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome. Your hand, Salerio. What\u2019s the news from Venice? How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio? I know he will be glad of our success. We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece. SALERIO. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost. PORTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the colour from Bassanio\u2019s cheek. Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man. What, worse and worse? With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself, And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you. BASSANIO. O sweet Portia, Here are a few of the unpleasant\u2019st words That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady, When I did first impart my love to you, I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman."], "What is the penalty for Portia\u2019s suitors if they guess the wrong casket?": [" I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea, Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence \u2019gainst the merchant there. SHYLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, The penalty and forfeit of my bond. PORTIA. Is he not able to discharge the money? BASSANIO. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court, Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o\u2019er On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority. To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will. PORTIA. It must not be, there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established; \u2019Twill be recorded for a precedent, And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state. It cannot be. SHYLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel! O wise young judge, how I do honour thee! PORTIA. I pray you let me look upon the bond. SHYLOCK. Here \u2019tis, most reverend doctor, here it is. PORTIA. Shylock, there\u2019s thrice thy money offered thee. SHYLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven. Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? No, not for Venice. PORTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit, And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant\u2019s heart. Be merciful, Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.", " I think the Frenchman became his surety, and seal\u2019d under for another. NERISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\u2019s nephew? PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him. NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father\u2019s will, if you should refuse to accept him. PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge. NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father\u2019s imposition, depending on the caskets. PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father\u2019s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.", " SOLANIO.

BASSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the self-same flight The self-same way, with more advised watch To find the other forth; and by adventuring both I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence. I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, That which I owe is lost. But if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, As I will watch the aim, or to find both, Or bring your latter hazard back again, And thankfully rest debtor for the first. ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance; And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have. Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak. BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu\u2019d To Cato\u2019s daughter, Brutus\u2019 Portia. Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\u2019 strond, And many Jasons come in quest of her."], "Who is the first suitor that actually chooses a casket?": [" The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\u2019er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\u2019er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word \u201cchoose\u201d! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\u2019d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none? NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lott\u2019ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come? PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection. NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. PORTIA. Ay, that\u2019s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\u2019d false with a smith. NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine. PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say \u201cAnd you will not have me, choose.\u201d He hears merry tales and smiles not.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MERCHANT OF VENICE *** This etext was prepared by the PG Shakespeare Team, a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers. cover THE MERCHANT OF VENICE by William Shakespeare Contents ACT I Scene I.

I once did lend my body for his wealth, Which but for him that had your husband\u2019s ring Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again, My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord Will never more break faith advisedly. PORTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this, And bid him keep it better than the other. ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring. BASSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor! PORTIA. I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio, For by this ring, the doctor lay with me. NERISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano, For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor\u2019s clerk, In lieu of this, last night did lie with me. GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways In summer, where the ways are fair enough. What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv\u2019d it? PORTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz\u2019d. Here is a letter; read it at your leisure. It comes from Padua from Bellario. There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here Shall witness I set forth as soon as you, And even but now return\u2019d. I have not yet Enter\u2019d my house.

Thou know\u2019st that all my fortunes are at sea; Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum, therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do; That shall be rack\u2019d even to the uttermost, To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia. Go presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is, and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia\u2019s house. Enter Portia with her waiting-woman Nerissa. PORTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world. NERISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer. PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc\u2019d. NERISSA. They would be better if well followed. PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men\u2019s cottages princes\u2019 palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.", " BASSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul, No woman had it, but a civil doctor, Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me, And begg\u2019d the ring, the which I did deny him, And suffer\u2019d him to go displeas\u2019d away, Even he that had held up the very life Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady? I was enforc\u2019d to send it after him. I was beset with shame and courtesy. My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady; For by these blessed candles of the night, Had you been there, I think you would have begg\u2019d The ring of me to give the worthy doctor. PORTIA. Let not that doctor e\u2019er come near my house, Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, And that which you did swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you, I\u2019ll not deny him anything I have, No, not my body, nor my husband\u2019s bed. Know him I shall, I am well sure of it. Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus, If you do not, if I be left alone, Now by mine honour which is yet mine own, I\u2019ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow. NERISSA. And I his clerk. Therefore be well advis\u2019d How you do leave me to mine own protection. GRATIANO. Well, do you so. Let not me take him then, For if I do, I\u2019ll mar the young clerk\u2019s pen. ANTONIO. I am th\u2019 unhappy subject of these quarrels. PORTIA. Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding. BASSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong, And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes, Wherein I see myself\u2014 PORTIA.", " ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law, For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice, if it be denied, \u2019Twill much impeach the justice of the state, Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go. These griefs and losses have so bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.

Madam, although I speak it in your presence, You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord. But if you knew to whom you show this honour, How true a gentleman you send relief, How dear a lover of my lord your husband, I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you. PORTIA. I never did repent for doing good, Nor shall not now; for in companions That do converse and waste the time together, Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit; Which makes me think that this Antonio, Being the bosom lover of my lord, Must needs be like my lord.

There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish.

There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\u2019s that good for? SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac\u2019d me and hind\u2019red me half a million, laugh\u2019d at my losses, mock\u2019d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies.", " ANTONIO.

Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it, Within these two months, that\u2019s a month before This bond expires, I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond. SHYLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are, Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this, If he should break his day, what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture? A pound of man\u2019s flesh, taken from a man, Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say, To buy his favour, I extend this friendship. If he will take it, so. If not, adieu, And for my love I pray you wrong me not. ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond. SHYLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary\u2019s, Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I\u2019ll be with you. ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew. [_Exit Shylock._] This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind. BASSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain\u2019s mind. ANTONIO.

A pound of that same merchant\u2019s flesh is thine, The court awards it and the law doth give it. SHYLOCK. Most rightful judge! PORTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.

I do wonder, Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request. ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak. SHYLOCK. I\u2019ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak. I\u2019ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more. I\u2019ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool, To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors.

Yes, here I tender it for him in the court, Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o\u2019er On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart. If this will not suffice, it must appear That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, Wrest once the law to your authority. To do a great right, do a little wrong, And curb this cruel devil of his will. PORTIA.

You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance; And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have.

Ay, so he says. PORTIA. Do you confess the bond? ANTONIO. I do. PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful. SHYLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that. PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain\u2019d, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. \u2019Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown. His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway, It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God\u2019s When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy, And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy.", " SHYLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour.

Double six thousand, and then treble that, Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio\u2019s fault. First go with me to church and call me wife, And then away to Venice to your friend. For never shall you lie by Portia\u2019s side With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over. When it is paid, bring your true friend along. My maid Nerissa and myself meantime, Will live as maids and widows. Come, away! For you shall hence upon your wedding day. Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer; Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear. But let me hear the letter of your friend. BASSANIO. _Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are clear\u2019d between you and I, if I might but see you at my death.

Fair sir, you are well o\u2019erta\u2019en. My Lord Bassanio upon more advice, Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat Your company at dinner. PORTIA. That cannot be; His ring I do accept most thankfully, And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock\u2019s house. GRATIANO. That will I do. NERISSA. Sir, I would speak with you. [_Aside to Portia_.] I\u2019ll see if I can get my husband\u2019s ring, Which I did make him swear to keep for ever. PORTIA. [_To Nerissa_.] Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men; But we\u2019ll outface them, and outswear them too. Away! make haste! Thou know\u2019st where I will tarry. NERISSA.

My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg\u2019d it, and indeed Deserv\u2019d it too. And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begg\u2019d mine, And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings. PORTIA. What ring gave you, my lord? Not that, I hope, which you receiv\u2019d of me. BASSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it, but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone. PORTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth. By heaven, I will ne\u2019er come in your bed Until I see the ring. NERISSA. Nor I in yours Till I again see mine! BASSANIO. Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring, When nought would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure. PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas\u2019d to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony? Nerissa teaches me what to believe: I\u2019ll die for\u2019t but some woman had the ring.", " PORTIA. I will have nothing else but only this, And now methinks I have a mind to it. BASSANIO. There\u2019s more depends on this than on the value. The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation, Only for this I pray you pardon me. PORTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers. You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer\u2019d. BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife, And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it. PORTIA. That \u2019scuse serves many men to save their gifts. And if your wife be not a mad-woman, And know how well I have deserv\u2019d this ring, She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you! [_Exeunt Portia and Nerissa._] ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring. Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued \u2019gainst your wife\u2019s commandment. BASSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him; Give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst Unto Antonio\u2019s house. Away, make haste.

Why, this is like the mending of highways In summer, where the ways are fair enough. What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv\u2019d it? PORTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz\u2019d.

SOLANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio,\u2014O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!\u2014 SALARINO. Come, the full stop. SOLANIO. Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship. SALARINO. I would it might prove the end of his losses. SOLANIO. Let me say \u201camen\u201d betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.", " I\u2019ll tell thee more of this another time. But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon, this opinion. Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while. I\u2019ll end my exhortation after dinner. LORENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time. I must be one of these same dumb wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak. GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue. ANTONIO. Fare you well. I\u2019ll grow a talker for this gear. GRATIANO. Thanks, i\u2019 faith, for silence is only commendable In a neat\u2019s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible. [_Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo._] ANTONIO. Is that anything now? BASSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the search. ANTONIO. Well, tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you today promis\u2019d to tell me of? BASSANIO. \u2019Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance. Nor do I now make moan to be abridg\u2019d From such a noble rate, but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag\u2019d. To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love, And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe.", " Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer. JESSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames? They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light. Why, \u2019tis an office of discovery, love, And I should be obscur\u2019d. LORENZO. So are you, sweet, Even in the lovely garnish of a boy. But come at once, For the close night doth play the runaway, And we are stay\u2019d for at Bassanio\u2019s feast. JESSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself With some moe ducats, and be with you straight. [_Exit above._] GRATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew. LORENZO. Beshrew me but I love her heartily, For she is wise, if I can judge of her, And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true, And true she is, as she hath prov\u2019d herself. And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true, Shall she be placed in my constant soul. Enter Jessica. What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away! Our masquing mates by this time for us stay. [_Exit with Jessica and Salarino._] Enter Antonio. ANTONIO. Who\u2019s there? GRATIANO. Signior Antonio! ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest? \u2019Tis nine o\u2019clock, our friends all stay for you. No masque tonight, the wind is come about; Bassanio presently will go aboard. I have sent twenty out to seek for you. GRATIANO. I am glad on\u2019t. I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight. [_Exeunt._] SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in Portia\u2019s house. Flourish of cornets."]}
