Why then you are in love. ANTONIO. Fie, fie! SALARINO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry; and \u2019twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, Nature hath fram\u2019d strange fellows in her time: Some that will evermore peep through their eyes, And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper. And other of such vinegar aspect That they\u2019ll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable. Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo and Gratiano. SOLANIO. Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well. We leave you now with better company. SALARINO. I would have stay\u2019d till I had made you merry, If worthier friends had not prevented me. ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard. I take it your own business calls on you, And you embrace th\u2019 occasion to depart.", " SALARINO. Good morrow, my good lords. BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when? You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so? SALARINO. We\u2019ll make our leisures to attend on yours. [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio._] LORENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you, but at dinner-time I pray you have in mind where we must meet. BASSANIO. I will not fail you. GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio, You have too much respect upon the world. They lose it that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang\u2019d. ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano, A stage, where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one. GRATIANO. Let me play the fool, With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?", " SHYLOCK. I have possess\u2019d your Grace of what I purpose, And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond. If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city\u2019s freedom! You\u2019ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats. I\u2019ll not answer that, But say it is my humour. Is it answer\u2019d? What if my house be troubled with a rat, And I be pleas\u2019d to give ten thousand ducats To have it ban\u2019d? What, are you answer\u2019d yet? Some men there are love not a gaping pig; Some that are mad if they behold a cat; And others, when the bagpipe sings i\u2019 the nose, Cannot contain their urine; for affection Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer: As there is no firm reason to be render\u2019d Why he cannot abide a gaping pig, Why he a harmless necessary cat, Why he a woollen bagpipe, but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend, himself being offended, So can I give no reason, nor I will not, More than a lodg\u2019d hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio, that I follow thus A losing suit against him."], "From what characterflaw does Bassanio believe Gratiano suffers?": [" These things being bought and orderly bestow\u2019d, Return in haste, for I do feast tonight My best esteem\u2019d acquaintance; hie thee, go. LEONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein. Enter Gratiano. GRATIANO. Where\u2019s your master? LEONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks. [_Exit._] GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio! BASSANIO. Gratiano! GRATIANO. I have suit to you. BASSANIO. You have obtain\u2019d it. GRATIANO. You must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont. BASSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano, Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice, Parts that become thee happily enough, And in such eyes as ours appear not faults; But where thou art not known, why there they show Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviour I be misconst\u2019red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes. GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me.", " SALARINO. Good morrow, my good lords. BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when? You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so? SALARINO.

My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, We two will leave you, but at dinner-time I pray you have in mind where we must meet. BASSANIO. I will not fail you. GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio, You have too much respect upon the world. They lose it that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang\u2019d. ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano, A stage, where every man must play a part, And mine a sad one. GRATIANO. Let me play the fool, With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?", " NERISSA. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas\u2019d withal. BASSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith? GRATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord. BASSANIO. Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage. GRATIANO. We\u2019ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats. NERISSA. What! and stake down? GRATIANO. No, we shall ne\u2019er win at that sport and stake down. But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio! Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and Salerio. BASSANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither, If that the youth of my new int\u2019rest here Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave, I bid my very friends and countrymen, Sweet Portia, welcome. PORTIA. So do I, my lord, They are entirely welcome. LORENZO. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord, My purpose was not to have seen you here, But meeting with Salerio by the way, He did entreat me, past all saying nay, To come with him along.", " GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue. ANTONIO. Fare you well. I\u2019ll grow a talker for this gear. GRATIANO. Thanks, i\u2019 faith, for silence is only commendable In a neat\u2019s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible. [_Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo._] ANTONIO. Is that anything now? BASSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the search. ANTONIO. Well, tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you today promis\u2019d to tell me of? BASSANIO. \u2019Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance. Nor do I now make moan to be abridg\u2019d From such a noble rate, but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time, something too prodigal, Hath left me gag\u2019d."], "The caskets thatPortia\u2019s suitors must pick from are made of what materials?": [" ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance; And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have. Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak. BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu\u2019d To Cato\u2019s daughter, Brutus\u2019 Portia. Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\u2019 strond, And many Jasons come in quest of her. O my Antonio, had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate.", " PORTIA. Go, draw aside the curtains and discover The several caskets to this noble prince. Now make your choice. PRINCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears, \u201cWho chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.\u201d The second, silver, which this promise carries, \u201cWho chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\u201d This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt, \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d How shall I know if I do choose the right? PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, prince. If you choose that, then I am yours withal. PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see. I will survey the inscriptions back again. What says this leaden casket? \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead! This casket threatens; men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages: A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross, I\u2019ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.", " Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity. O that estates, degrees, and offices Were not deriv\u2019d corruptly, and that clear honour Were purchas\u2019d by the merit of the wearer! How many then should cover that stand bare? How many be commanded that command? How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honour? And how much honour Pick\u2019d from the chaff and ruin of the times, To be new varnish\u2019d? Well, but to my choice. \u201cWho chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\u201d I will assume desert. Give me a key for this, And instantly unlock my fortunes here. [_He opens the silver casket._] PORTIA. Too long a pause for that which you find there. ARRAGON. What\u2019s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule! I will read it. How much unlike art thou to Portia! How much unlike my hopes and my deservings! \u201cWho chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.\u201d Did I deserve no more than a fool\u2019s head?", " But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come? PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection. NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. PORTIA. Ay, that\u2019s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\u2019d false with a smith. NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine. PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say \u201cAnd you will not have me, choose.\u201d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death\u2019s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!"], "Which of the followingis not a reason Shylock gives for hating Antonio?": [" SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats, well. BASSANIO. Ay, sir, for three months. SHYLOCK. For three months, well. BASSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound. SHYLOCK. Antonio shall become bound, well. BASSANIO. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer? SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound. BASSANIO. Your answer to that. SHYLOCK. Antonio is a good man. BASSANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary? SHYLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves\u2014I mean pirates\u2014and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.", " He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him! BASSANIO. Shylock, do you hear? SHYLOCK. I am debating of my present store, And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me. But soft! how many months Do you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior, Your worship was the last man in our mouths. ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I\u2019ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess\u2019d How much ye would? SHYLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats. ANTONIO. And for three months. SHYLOCK. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.", " This was a way to thrive, and he was blest; And thrift is blessing if men steal it not. ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv\u2019d for, A thing not in his power to bring to pass, But sway\u2019d and fashion\u2019d by the hand of heaven. Was this inserted to make interest good? Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams? SHYLOCK. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast. But note me, signior. ANTONIO. Mark you this, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart. O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath! SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats, \u2019tis a good round sum. Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate. ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you? SHYLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances. Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, (For suff\u2019rance is the badge of all our tribe.)", " I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation._ You hear the learn\u2019d Bellario what he writes, And here, I take it, is the doctor come. Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws. Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario? PORTIA. I did, my lord. DUKE. You are welcome. Take your place. Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court? PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause. Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew? DUKE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth. PORTIA. Is your name Shylock? SHYLOCK. Shylock is my name. PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow, Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Cannot impugn you as you do proceed. [_To Antonio_.] You stand within his danger, do you not? ANTONIO. Ay, so he says. PORTIA. Do you confess the bond? ANTONIO. I do. PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful."], "How does Shylockinitially describe his demand for a pound of flesh to Bassanio andAntonio?": [" SHYLOCK. These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter\u2014 Would any of the stock of Barabbas Had been her husband, rather than a Christian! We trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence. PORTIA. A pound of that same merchant\u2019s flesh is thine, The court awards it and the law doth give it. SHYLOCK. Most rightful judge! PORTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast. The law allows it and the court awards it. SHYLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare. PORTIA. Tarry a little, there is something else. This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood. The words expressly are \u201ca pound of flesh\u201d: Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh, But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate Unto the state of Venice. GRATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge! SHYLOCK. Is that the law?", " Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will. BASSANIO. For thy three thousand ducats here is six. SHYLOCK. If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts, and every part a ducat, I would not draw them, I would have my bond. DUKE. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend\u2019ring none? SHYLOCK. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong? You have among you many a purchas\u2019d slave, Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules, You use in abject and in slavish parts, Because you bought them. Shall I say to you \u201cLet them be free, marry them to your heirs? Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates Be season\u2019d with such viands\u201d? You will answer \u201cThe slaves are ours.\u201d So do I answer you: The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought; \u2019tis mine and I will have it. If you deny me, fie upon your law! There is no force in the decrees of Venice.", " PORTIA. Thyself shalt see the act. For, as thou urgest justice, be assur\u2019d Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir\u2019st. GRATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge! SHYLOCK. I take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go. BASSANIO. Here is the money. PORTIA. Soft! The Jew shall have all justice. Soft! no haste! He shall have nothing but the penalty. GRATIANO. O Jew, an upright judge, a learned judge! PORTIA. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh. Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more, But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak\u2019st more Or less than a just pound, be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance, Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate. GRATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew! Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.", " SHYLOCK. She is damn\u2019d for it. SALARINO. That\u2019s certain, if the devil may be her judge. SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel! SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years? SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood. SALARINO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO. Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What\u2019s that good for? SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge."], "Why does the princeof Morocco fear that Portia will dislike him?": [" ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.

Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge. NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father\u2019s imposition, depending on the caskets. PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father\u2019s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure. NERISSA.

PORTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love. BASSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust, Which makes me fear th\u2019 enjoying of my love. There may as well be amity and life \u2019Tween snow and fire as treason and my love. PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything. BASSANIO. Promise me life, and I\u2019ll confess the truth. PORTIA. Well then, confess and live. BASSANIO. \u201cConfess and love\u201d Had been the very sum of my confession: O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance! But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas\u2019d to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony?

There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur\u2019sy; let him look to his bond. SALARINO.

PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, prince. If you choose that, then I am yours withal. PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see. I will survey the inscriptions back again. What says this leaden casket? \u201cWho chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\u201d Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead!

I am enjoin\u2019d by oath to observe three things: First, never to unfold to anyone Which casket \u2019twas I chose; next, if I fail Of the right casket, never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage; Lastly, If I do fail in fortune of my choice, Immediately to leave you and be gone.", " NERISSA. They would be better if well followed. PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men\u2019s cottages princes\u2019 palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\u2019er a cold decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\u2019er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word \u201cchoose\u201d! I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb\u2019d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none? NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations. Therefore the lott\u2019ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love.", " PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge. NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father\u2019s imposition, depending on the caskets. PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father\u2019s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure. NERISSA.

BASSANIO. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further. Take some remembrance of us as a tribute, Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you, Not to deny me, and to pardon me. PORTIA. You press me far, and therefore I will yield. [_To Antonio_.] Give me your gloves, I\u2019ll wear them for your sake. [_To Bassanio_.] And, for your love, I\u2019ll take this ring from you. Do not draw back your hand; I\u2019ll take no more, And you in love shall not deny me this. BASSANIO. This ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle, I will not shame myself to give you this. PORTIA. I will have nothing else but only this, And now methinks I have a mind to it. BASSANIO. There\u2019s more depends on this than on the value. The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation, Only for this I pray you pardon me. PORTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.", " BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun. PORTIA.

Give welcome to my friend. This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound. PORTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him, For, as I hear, he was much bound for you. ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of. PORTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house. It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. GRATIANO.

There may as well be amity and life \u2019Tween snow and fire as treason and my love. PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything. BASSANIO. Promise me life, and I\u2019ll confess the truth. PORTIA. Well then, confess and live.

Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad.

Go presently inquire, and so will I, Where money is, and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia\u2019s house. Enter Portia with her waiting-woman Nerissa. PORTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world. NERISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer. PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc\u2019d.", " ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance; And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have. Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak. BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left, And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu\u2019d To Cato\u2019s daughter, Brutus\u2019 Portia. Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\u2019 strond, And many Jasons come in quest of her. O my Antonio, had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them, I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate."], "What animal does Shylock remember Antonio comparing him to?": [" PORTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call\u2019d. NERISSA. True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look\u2019d upon, was the best deserving a fair lady. PORTIA. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise. Enter a Servingman. How now! what news? SERVINGMAN. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight. PORTIA. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. Venice. A public place. Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.", " SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats, well. BASSANIO. Ay, sir, for three months. SHYLOCK. For three months, well. BASSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound. SHYLOCK. Antonio shall become bound, well. BASSANIO. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer? SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound. BASSANIO. Your answer to that. SHYLOCK. Antonio is a good man. BASSANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary? SHYLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves\u2014I mean pirates\u2014and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.", " He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, Even there where merchants most do congregate, On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him! BASSANIO. Shylock, do you hear? SHYLOCK. I am debating of my present store, And by the near guess of my memory I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me. But soft! how many months Do you desire? [_To Antonio._] Rest you fair, good signior, Your worship was the last man in our mouths. ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I\u2019ll break a custom. [_To Bassanio._] Is he yet possess\u2019d How much ye would? SHYLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats. ANTONIO. And for three months. SHYLOCK. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.", " This was a way to thrive, and he was blest; And thrift is blessing if men steal it not. ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv\u2019d for, A thing not in his power to bring to pass, But sway\u2019d and fashion\u2019d by the hand of heaven. Was this inserted to make interest good? Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams? SHYLOCK. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast. But note me, signior. ANTONIO. Mark you this, Bassanio, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose. An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart. O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath! SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats, \u2019tis a good round sum. Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate. ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you? SHYLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances. Still have I borne it with a patient shrug, (For suff\u2019rance is the badge of all our tribe.)"], "Lorenzo and Portia discuss helping Antonio. Why does Portia agree to help?": [" Peace!

I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad.

Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation.

Here comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter. LORENZO. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode. Not I but my affairs have made you wait. When you shall please to play the thieves for wives, I\u2019ll watch as long for you then. Approach. Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who\u2019s within? Enter Jessica above, in boy\u2019s clothes. JESSICA. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty, Albeit I\u2019ll swear that I do know your tongue. LORENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love. JESSICA. Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed, For who love I so much? And now who knows But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?"], "What does Portia believe makes the music she and Nerissa hear more beautiful?": [" Enter Musicians. Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn. With sweetest touches pierce your mistress\u2019 ear, And draw her home with music. [_Music._] JESSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music. LORENZO. The reason is, your spirits are attentive. For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud, Which is the hot condition of their blood, If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, Or any air of music touch their ears, You shall perceive them make a mutual stand, Their savage eyes turn\u2019d to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods, Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage, But music for the time doth change his nature. The man that hath no music in himself, Nor is not mov\u2019d with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils; The motions of his spirit are dull as night, And his affections dark as Erebus.", " Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music. Enter Portia and Nerissa. PORTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world. NERISSA. When the moon shone we did not see the candle. PORTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less. A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters. Music! hark! NERISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house. PORTIA. Nothing is good, I see, without respect. Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day. NERISSA. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam. PORTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended; and I think The nightingale, if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren. How many things by season season\u2019d are To their right praise and true perfection!", " Let me choose, For as I am, I live upon the rack. PORTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love. BASSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust, Which makes me fear th\u2019 enjoying of my love. There may as well be amity and life \u2019Tween snow and fire as treason and my love. PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything. BASSANIO. Promise me life, and I\u2019ll confess the truth. PORTIA. Well then, confess and live. BASSANIO. \u201cConfess and love\u201d Had been the very sum of my confession: O happy torment, when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance! But let me to my fortune and the caskets. PORTIA. Away, then! I am lock\u2019d in one of them. If you do love me, you will find me out. Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof. Let music sound while he doth make his choice. Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end, Fading in music.", " But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come? PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and according to my description level at my affection. NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince. PORTIA. Ay, that\u2019s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play\u2019d false with a smith. NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine. PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say \u201cAnd you will not have me, choose.\u201d He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death\u2019s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!"], "Why does Nerissa chastise her husband Gratiano, who has given away her ring?": [" The same. A street. Enter Portia and Nerissa. PORTIA. Inquire the Jew\u2019s house out, give him this deed, And let him sign it, we\u2019ll away tonight, And be a day before our husbands home. This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo. Enter Gratiano. GRATIANO. Fair sir, you are well o\u2019erta\u2019en. My Lord Bassanio upon more advice, Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat Your company at dinner. PORTIA. That cannot be; His ring I do accept most thankfully, And so I pray you tell him. Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock\u2019s house. GRATIANO. That will I do. NERISSA. Sir, I would speak with you. [_Aside to Portia_.] I\u2019ll see if I can get my husband\u2019s ring, Which I did make him swear to keep for ever. PORTIA. [_To Nerissa_.] Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing That they did give the rings away to men; But we\u2019ll outface them, and outswear them too. Away! make haste! Thou know\u2019st where I will tarry.", " By heaven, I will ne\u2019er come in your bed Until I see the ring. NERISSA. Nor I in yours Till I again see mine! BASSANIO. Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring, When nought would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure. PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, Or your own honour to contain the ring, You would not then have parted with the ring. What man is there so much unreasonable, If you had pleas\u2019d to have defended it With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony? Nerissa teaches me what to believe: I\u2019ll die for\u2019t but some woman had the ring. BASSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul, No woman had it, but a civil doctor, Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me, And begg\u2019d the ring, the which I did deny him, And suffer\u2019d him to go displeas\u2019d away, Even he that had held up the very life Of my dear friend.", " You taught me first to beg, and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer\u2019d. BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife, And when she put it on, she made me vow That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it. PORTIA. That \u2019scuse serves many men to save their gifts. And if your wife be not a mad-woman, And know how well I have deserv\u2019d this ring, She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you! [_Exeunt Portia and Nerissa._] ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring. Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued \u2019gainst your wife\u2019s commandment. BASSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him; Give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst Unto Antonio\u2019s house. Away, make haste. [_Exit Gratiano._] Come, you and I will thither presently, And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II.", " I gave my love a ring, and made him swear Never to part with it, and here he stands. I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief, An \u2019twere to me I should be mad at it. BASSANIO. [_Aside._] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off, And swear I lost the ring defending it. GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg\u2019d it, and indeed Deserv\u2019d it too. And then the boy, his clerk, That took some pains in writing, he begg\u2019d mine, And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings. PORTIA. What ring gave you, my lord? Not that, I hope, which you receiv\u2019d of me. BASSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it, but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone. PORTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth."], "What does Antonio offer as bond against any future infidelity by Gratiano or Bassanio?": [" Commend me to your honourable wife, Tell her the process of Antonio\u2019s end, Say how I lov\u2019d you, speak me fair in death. And when the tale is told, bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love. Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt. For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I\u2019ll pay it instantly with all my heart. BASSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself, But life itself, my wife, and all the world, Are not with me esteem\u2019d above thy life. I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil, to deliver you. PORTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer. GRATIANO.

ANTONIO. Content, in faith, I\u2019ll seal to such a bond, And say there is much kindness in the Jew. BASSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me, I\u2019ll rather dwell in my necessity.", " These things being bought and orderly bestow\u2019d, Return in haste, for I do feast tonight My best esteem\u2019d acquaintance; hie thee, go.

I will not fail you. GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio, You have too much respect upon the world. They lose it that do buy it with much care. Believe me, you are marvellously chang\u2019d.
