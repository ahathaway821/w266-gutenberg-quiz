What the voice of persuasion had failed in for a year, accident had silently accomplished in a single day. The circumstance I allude to was this: I received a copy of the Iliad and Odyssey of Pope, then recently published by the Editor above mentioned, with illustrative and critical notes of his own."], "Which of the followingcharacters do not engage in one-on-one combat with each other inthe poem?": [" The Editor has been confirmed in this opinion by the concurrence of every person with whom he has communicated on the subject. Among others he takes the liberty of mentioning Mr. Cary, whose authority upon such a question is of especial weight, the Translator of Dante being the only one of our countrymen who has ever executed a translation of equal magnitude and not less difficulty, with the same perfect fidelity and admirable skill. In support of this determination, the case of Tasso may be cited as curiously in point. The great Italian poet altered his Jerusalem like Cowper, against his own judgment, in submission to his critics: he made the alteration in the latter years of his life, and in a diseased state of mind; and he proceeded upon the same prescribed rule of smoothing down his versification, and removing all the elisions. The consequence has been that the reconstructed poem is utterly neglected, and has rarely, if ever, been reprinted, except in the two great editions of his collected works; while the original poem has been and continues to be in such demand, that the most diligent bibliographer might vainly attempt to enumerate all the editions through which it has passed.", " A figurative expression.

The ceremony of cutting off the hair in honor of the dead, was practised not only among the Greeks, but among other nations.", " It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from the Gods forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their general at their head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon this hinge turns the whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of Patroclus, and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles. The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents. He gives Achilles the pleasure of seeing that the Greeks could not carry on the war without his assistance, and upon this depends the great catastrophe of the poem. 291 THE ILIAD.

We can hardly imagine that a poem of the length and general excellence of the Iliad, could be composed without the aid of writing; and yet, we are told, there are well-authenticated examples of such works being preserved and handed down by traditional memory. However this may be, we know that the Oriental nations were in possession of the art of alphabetical writing it a very early period, and before the Trojan war. It cannot, then, seem very improbable, that the authors of the Iliad should also have been acquainted with it.\u2014Felton. The Solymi were an ancient nation inhabiting the mountainous parts of Asia Minor, between Lycia and Pisidia. Pliny mentions them as having become extinct in his time.

Then, due libation made, Each sought his tent, and took the gift of sleep. There is much in this book which is worthy of close attention. The consummate genius, the varied and versatile power, the eloquence, truth, and nature displayed in it, will always be admired.

The sacredness attached to it gave him hopes that they would not violate his person, should he chance to be taken; and his riches he knew were sufficient to purchase his liberty. Besides these advantages, he probably trusted to his swiftness to escape pursuit. Eustathius remarks upon the different manner in which the Grecians and Trojans conduct the same enterprise.

According to the belief of the ancients, the gods were supposed to have a peculiar light in their eyes. That Homer was not ignorant of this opinion appears from his use of it in other places. Minerva is the goddess of the art of war rather than of war itself. And this fable of her descent is an allegory of Achilles restraining his wrath through his consideration of martial law and order. This law in that age, prescribed that a subordinate should not draw his sword upon the commander of all, but allowed a liberty of speech which appears to us moderns rather out of order.\u2014E.P.P.

We can hardly imagine that a poem of the length and general excellence of the Iliad, could be composed without the aid of writing; and yet, we are told, there are well-authenticated examples of such works being preserved and handed down by traditional memory. However this may be, we know that the Oriental nations were in possession of the art of alphabetical writing it a very early period, and before the Trojan war. It cannot, then, seem very improbable, that the authors of the Iliad should also have been acquainted with it.\u2014Felton. The Solymi were an ancient nation inhabiting the mountainous parts of Asia Minor, between Lycia and Pisidia. Pliny mentions them as having become extinct in his time. It was the custom in ancient times, upon the performance of any signal service by kings or great men, for the public to grant them a tract of land as a reward.", " As the poet did not intend to draw the character of a perfect man in Achilles, he makes him delighted with the destruction of the Greeks, because it gratified his revenge. That resentment which is the subject of the poem, still presides over every other feeling, even the love of his country. He begins now to pity his countrymen, yet he seems gratified by their distress, because it will contribute to his glory. This onion was very different from the root which now passes under that name.

Upon observing her confusion, he attributes the misfortunes of the war to the gods alone. This sentiment is also natural to old age. Those who have had the longest experience of life, are the most inclined to ascribe the disposal of all things to the will of Heaven. This view of the Grecian leaders from the walls of Troy, is admired as an episode of great beauty, and considered a masterly manner of acquainting the reader with the figure and qualifications of each hero. Helen sees no where in the plain her two brothers Castor and Pollux. Her inquiry is a natural one, and her self-reproach naturally suggests her own disgrace as the cause of their not appearing among the other commanders.

The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege."], "Who raised Patroclus?": [" 387 THE ILIAD.

Very far removed from the savage state on the one hand, and equally distant from the artificial state of an extended commerce and a manufacturing population on the other, the spirit and habitudes of the two modes of society are almost identical. The hero and the Patriarch are substantially co\u00ebval; but the first wanders in twilight, the last stands in the eye of Heaven. When three men appeared to Abraham in the plains of Mamre, he ran to meet them from the tent door, brought them in, directed Sarah to make bread, fetched from the herd himself a calf tender and good, dressed it, and set it before them.

It is real and important; it affords a standard of the feelings with which we ought to read the Iliad, if we mean to read it as it deserves; and it explains and sets in the true point of view numberless passages, which the ignorance or frivolity of after-times has charged with obscurity, meanness or error. The Old Testament and the Iliad reflect light mutually on each other; and both in respect of poetry and morals (for the whole of Homer\u2019s poetry is a praise of virtue, and every thing in him tends to this point, except that which is merely superfluous and for ornament) it may with great truth be said, that he who has the longest studied, and the most deeply imbibed, the spirit of the Hebrew Bible, will the best understand and the most lastingly appreciate the tale of Troy divine.\u2014H.N."], "What magicalcharm does Hera use in seducing Zeus and making him fall asleep?": [" In _antiquity_, a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_, any sacrifice of a large number of victims. [The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids. The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend.

[\u0391\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03b7\u03bd.] Homer represents Aphrodite as the protector of \u00c6neas, and in the battle of the Trojans, Ares appears in a disadvantageous light; the weakness of the goddess, and the brutal confidence of the god are described with evident irony. In like manner Diana and the river-god Scamander sometimes play a very undignified part. Apollo alone uniformly maintains his dignity.\u2014Muller. This is a very beautiful soliloquy of Agenor, such as would naturally arise in the soul of a brave man going upon a desperate enterprise. From the conclusion it is evident, that the story of Achilles being invulnerable except in the heel, is an invention of a later age. Footnotes for Book XXII: This simile is very striking.

Homer takes occasion from it, to open the scene with a beautiful allegory. He supposes that such afflictions are sent from Heaven for the punishment of evil actions; and because the sun was the principal agent, he says it was sent to punish Agamemnon for despising that god, and injuring his priest. Hippocrates observes two things of plagues; that their cause is in the air, and that different animals are differently affected by them, according to their nature and nourishment. This philosophy is referred to the plagues here mentioned. First, the cause is in the air by means of the darts or beams of Apollo; second, the mules and dogs are said to die sooner than the men, partly from their natural quickness of smell, and partly from their feeding so near the earth whence the exhalations arise.", " The poet here changes the narration, and apostrophises the reader. Critics commend this figure, as the reader then becomes a spectator, and his mind is kept fixed on the action. In the following review of the army, we see the skill of an accomplished general as well as the characters of the leaders whom Agamemnon addresses. He begins with an address to the army in general, and then turns to individuals. To the brave he urges their secure hopes of conquest, since the gods must punish perjury; to the timid, their inevitable destruction if the enemy should burn their ships. After this he flies from rank to rank, skilfully addressing each ally, and presents a lively picture of a great mind in the highest emotion. The ancients usually in their feasts divided to the guests in equal portions, except they took particular occasion to show distinction. It was then considered the highest mark of honor to be allotted the best portion of meat and wine, and to be allowed an exemption from the laws of the feast in drinking wine unmingled and without measure.", " Homer magnifies the ambush as the boldest enterprise of war. They went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of sceptre.

The effect of Helen\u2019s appearance upon the aged counsellors is striking and poetical. It must be borne in mind, that Helen was of divine parentage and unfading beauty, and this will explain the enthusiasm which her sight called forth from the old men. The poet\u2019s skill in taking this method of describing the Grecian chieftains is obvious, and the sketches themselves are living and characteristic to a high degree. The reminiscences of the aged Priam, as their names are announced, and the penitential sorrow of the erring Helen, which the sight of her countrymen, and the recollection of her home, her child, her companions, excite in her bosom, are among the most skilful touches of natural feeling.\u2014Felton.", " Probably it had some private mark, and not the name, as it was only recognized by the owner. This reply is supposed to allude to some gesture made by Ajax in approaching Hector. The heralds were considered as sacred persons, the delegates of Mercury, and inviolable by the laws of nations.

In fact, it is one of his numberless excellences, and a point in which his judgment never fails him, that he is grand and lofty always in the right place, and knows infallibly how to rise and fall with his subject. _Big words on small matters_ may serve as a pretty exact definition of the burlesque; an instance of which they will find in the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, but none in the Iliad. By others I expect to be told that my numbers, though here and there tolerably smooth, are not always such, but have, now and then, an ugly hitch in their gait, ungraceful in itself, and inconvenient to the reader.

This speech of Nestor is happily conceived. It belonged to him as the aged counsellor to begin the debate, by laying the subject before the assembly, especially as it was necessary to impale the blame of the present unfortunate condition of the army to Agamemnon. It would have been presumptuous in any other, and it was a matter of difficulty and delicacy even for Nestor.\u2014Felton. In the heroic age, the bridegroom, before marriage, was obliged to make two presents, one to his betrothed wife, and one to his father-in-law. This was also an ancient custom of the Hebrews.

There are none, I believe, which I have not translated in one way or other, though the reader will not find them repeated so often as most of them are in Homer, for a reason that need not be mentioned. Few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the Iliad or Odyssey by their own name only, but their patronymic is given also.

This is a striking simile, from its exactness in two points\u2014the noise and the order. It has been supposed that the embattling of an army was first learned by observing the close order of the flight of these birds. The noise of the Trojans contrasts strongly with the silence of the Greeks. Plutarch remarks upon this distinction as a credit to the military discipline of the latter, and Homer would seem to have attached some importance to it, as he again alludes to the same thing.

This passage sufficiently justifies Diomede for his choice of Ulysses. Diomede, who was most renowned for valor, might have given a wrong interpretation to this omen, and have been discouraged from proceeding in the attempt. For though it really signified that, as the bird was not seen, but only heard, so they should not be discovered by the Trojans, but perform actions of which all Troy should hear with sorrow; yet, on the other hand, it might imply that, as they discovered the bird by the noise of its wings, so the noise they should make would betray them to the Trojans.", " Which penalty should Priam and his sons345 Not pay, though Paris fall, then here in arms I will contend for payment of the mulct My due, till, satisfied, I close the war.

Thus burn\u2019d the battle like devouring fire. Meantime, Antilochus with rapid steps Came to Achilles. Him he found before His lofty barks, occupied, as he stood, With boding fears of all that had befall\u2019n.5 He groan\u2019d, and to his noble self he said.

[To control anger argues a great mind\u2014and to avoid occasions that may betray one into it, argues a still greater. An observation that should suggest itself to us with no little force, when Achilles, not remarkable either for patience or meekness, exhorts Priam to beware of provoking him; and when having cleansed the body of Hector and covered it, he places it himself in the litter, lest his father, seeing how indecently he had treated it, should be exasperated at the sight, and by some passionate reproach exasperate himself also.", " While ye on preparation of the feast940 Attended both, Ulysses and myself Stood in the vestibule; Achilles flew Toward us, introduced us by the hand, And, seating us, such liberal portion gave To each, as hospitality requires.945 Our thirst, at length, and hunger both sufficed, I, foremost speaking, ask\u2019d you to the wars, And ye were eager both, but from your sires Much admonition, ere ye went, received. Old Peleus charged Achilles to aspire950 To highest praise, and always to excel. But thee, thy sire Men\u0153tius thus advised. \u201cMy son! Achilles boasts the nobler birth, But thou art elder; he in strength excels Thee far; thou, therefore, with discretion rule955 His inexperience; thy advice impart With gentleness; instruction wise suggest Wisely, and thou shalt find him apt to learn.\u201d So thee thy father taught, but, as it seems, In vain. Yet even now essay to move960 Warlike Achilles; if the Gods so please, Who knows but that thy reasons may prevail To rouse his valiant heart?"], "What does Chryses want Agamemnon to do?": [" Meantime Ulysses came To Chrysa with the Hecatomb in charge. Arrived within the haven[30] deep, their sails Furling, they stowed them in the bark below.535 Then by its tackle lowering swift the mast Into its crutch, they briskly push\u2019d to land, Heaved anchors out, and moor\u2019d the vessel fast. Forth came the mariners, and trod the beach; Forth came the victims of Apollo next,540 And, last, Chrys\u00ebis. Her Ulysses led Toward the altar, gave her to the arms Of her own father, and him thus address\u2019d. O Chryses! Agamemnon, King of men, Hath sent thy daughter home, with whom we bring545 A Hecatomb on all our host\u2019s behalf To Ph\u0153bus, hoping to appease the God 022 By whose dread shafts the Argives now expire. So saying, he gave her to him, who with joy Received his daughter. Then, before the shrine550 Magnificent in order due they ranged The noble Hecatomb. [31] Each laved his hands And took the salted meal, and Chryses made His fervent prayer with hands upraised on high.", " Since, mother, though ordain\u2019d so soon to die,440 I am thy son, I might with cause expect Some honor at the Thunderer\u2019s hands, but none To me he shows, whom Agamemnon, Chief 018 Of the Achaians, hath himself disgraced, Seizing by violence my just reward.445 So prayed he weeping, whom his mother heard Within the gulfs of Ocean where she sat Beside her ancient sire. From the gray flood Ascending sudden, like a mist she came, Sat down before him, stroked his face, and said.450 Why weeps my son? and what is thy distress? Hide not a sorrow that I wish to share. To whom Achilles, sighing deep, replied. Why tell thee woes to thee already known? At Thebes, E\u00ebtion\u2019s city we arrived,455 Smote, sack\u2019d it, and brought all the spoil away. Just distribution made among the Greeks, The son of Atreus for his lot received Blooming Chrys\u00ebis. Her, Apollo\u2019s priest Old Chryses followed to Achaia\u2019s camp,460 That he might loose his daughter.", " 003 BOOK I. Achilles sing, O Goddess! Peleus\u2019 son; His wrath pernicious, who ten thousand woes Caused to Achaia\u2019s host, sent many a soul Illustrious into Ades premature, And Heroes gave (so stood the will of Jove)5 To dogs and to all ravening fowls a prey, When fierce dispute had separated once The noble Chief Achilles from the son Of Atreus, Agamemnon, King of men. Who them to strife impell\u2019d? What power divine?10 Latona\u2019s son and Jove\u2019s. [1] For he, incensed 004 Against the King, a foul contagion raised In all the host, and multitudes destroy\u2019d, For that the son of Atreus had his priest Dishonored, Chryses. To the fleet he came15 Bearing rich ransom glorious to redeem His daughter, and his hands charged with the wreath And golden sceptre[2] of the God shaft-arm\u2019d. His supplication was at large to all The host of Greece, but most of all to two,20 The sons of Atreus, highest in command. Ye gallant Chiefs, and ye their gallant host, (So may the Gods who in Olympus dwell Give Priam\u2019s treasures to you for a spoil And ye return in safety,) take my gifts25 And loose my child, in honor of the son Of Jove, Apollo, archer of the skies.", " Juno, queen of Olympus, sides with the Grecians. Mr. Coleridge (in his disquisition upon the Prometheus of \u00c6schylus, published in his Remains) shows very clearly by historical criticism, that Juno, in the Grecian religion, expressed the spirit of conservatism. Without going over his argument we assume it here, for Homer always attributes to Juno every thing that may be predicated of this principle. She is persistent, obstinate, acts from no idea, but often uses a superficial reasoning, and refers to Fate, with which she upbraids Jupiter. Jupiter is the intellectual power or Free Will, and by their union, or rather from their antagonism, the course of things proceeds with perpetual vicissitude, but with a great deal of life.\u2014E.P.P. Observe this Grecian priest. He has no political power, and commands little reverence. In Agamemnon\u2019s treatment of him, as well as Chryses, is seen the relation of the religion to the government."], "How does Apollo react to Chryses\u2019 prayers for help?": [" This Homer could only have known intuitively. In making Apollo author of the plague, he was confounded with Helios, which was frequent afterwards, but is not seen elsewhere in Homer. The arrows of Apollo were \u201csilent as light,\u201d and their emblem the sun\u2019s rays. The analogies are multitudinous between the natural and intellectual sun; but Helios and Apollo were two.\u2014E.P.P. There is something exceedingly venerable in this appearance of the priest. He comes with the ensigns of the gods to whom he belongs, with the laurel wreath, to show that he was a suppliant, and a golden sceptre, which the ancients gave in particular to Apollo, as they did one of silver to Diana. The art of this speech is remarkable. Chryses considers the army of Greeks, as made up of troops, partly from the kingdoms and partly from democracies, and therefore begins with a distinction that includes all. Then, as priest of Apollo, he prays that they may obtain the two blessings they most desire\u2014the conquest of Troy and a safe return.", " Prayers are Jove\u2019s daughters,[15] wrinkled,[16] lame, slant-eyed, Which though far distant, yet with constant pace Follow Offence. Offence, robust of limb,625 226 And treading firm the ground, outstrips them all, And over all the earth before them runs Hurtful to man. They, following, heal the hurt.

This speech of Agamemnon over his wounded brother, is full of noble power and touching eloquence. The Trojans have violated a truce sanctioned by a solemn sacrifice to the gods. The reflection that such perjury cannot pass with impunity, but that Jove will, sooner or later, punish it, occurs first to the mind of the warrior.

The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege.", " From Phylace, and from the flowery fields850 Of Pyrrhasus, a land to Ceres given By consecration, and from Iton green, Mother of flocks; from Antron by the sea, And from the grassy meads of Pteleus, came A people, whom while yet he lived, the brave855 Protesila\u00fcs led; but him the earth Now cover\u2019d dark and drear.

This is a striking simile, from its exactness in two points\u2014the noise and the order. It has been supposed that the embattling of an army was first learned by observing the close order of the flight of these birds. The noise of the Trojans contrasts strongly with the silence of the Greeks. Plutarch remarks upon this distinction as a credit to the military discipline of the latter, and Homer would seem to have attached some importance to it, as he again alludes to the same thing.

The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods.

His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege.", " Secondly, the restoration, the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles, and the withdrawing of the latter from the Grecian army. Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter. The poet, throughout this book, maintains a simple, unadorned style, but highly descriptive, and happily adapted to the nature of the subject.\u2014Felton. 029 THE ILIAD.

Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting sons520 Of Dardanus, within this narrow pass Stand firm, retreat not, but redeem the son Of Clytius, lest the Grecians of his arms Despoil him slain in battle at the ships. 376 So saying, at Ajax his bright spear he cast525 Him pierced he not, but Lycophron the son Of Mastor, a Cytherian, who had left Cytheras, fugitive for blood, and dwelt With Ajax. Him standing at Ajax\u2019 side, He pierced above his ear; down from the stern530 Supine he fell, and in the dust expired. Then, shuddering, Ajax to his brother spake.

The effect of Helen\u2019s appearance upon the aged counsellors is striking and poetical. It must be borne in mind, that Helen was of divine parentage and unfading beauty, and this will explain the enthusiasm which her sight called forth from the old men. The poet\u2019s skill in taking this method of describing the Grecian chieftains is obvious, and the sketches themselves are living and characteristic to a high degree. The reminiscences of the aged Priam, as their names are announced, and the penitential sorrow of the erring Helen, which the sight of her countrymen, and the recollection of her home, her child, her companions, excite in her bosom, are among the most skilful touches of natural feeling.\u2014Felton.", " Behold her husband!

According to the belief of the ancients, the gods were supposed to have a peculiar light in their eyes. That Homer was not ignorant of this opinion appears from his use of it in other places. Minerva is the goddess of the art of war rather than of war itself. And this fable of her descent is an allegory of Achilles restraining his wrath through his consideration of martial law and order. This law in that age, prescribed that a subordinate should not draw his sword upon the commander of all, but allowed a liberty of speech which appears to us moderns rather out of order.\u2014E.P.P.

No moral is so evident throughout the Iliad, as the dependence of man upon divine assistance and protection. Apollo saves Hector from the dart, and Minerva Ulysses.

[The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids. The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue.", " [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege.", " For that a person so singularly irascible and of a temper harsh as his, should not only be aware of his infirmity, but even guard against it with so much precaution, evidences a prudence truly wonderful.\u2014Plutarch.]\u2014Tr.

Clarke renders the word in this place, _falso met\u00fb, ludens,_ and Eustathius says that Achilles suggested such cause of fear to Priam, to excuse his lodging him in an exterior part of the tent. The general import of the Greek word is sarcastic, but here it signifies rather\u2014to intimidate. See also Dacier.]\u2014Tr. The poet here shows the importance of Achilles in the army. Agamemnon is the general, yet all the chief commanders appeal to him for advice, and on his own authority he promises Priam a cessation of arms. Giving his hand to confirm the promise, agrees with the custom of the present day. This lament of Andromache may be compared to her pathetic address to Hector in the scene at the Sc\u00e6an gate.", " The poet here changes the narration, and apostrophises the reader. Critics commend this figure, as the reader then becomes a spectator, and his mind is kept fixed on the action. In the following review of the army, we see the skill of an accomplished general as well as the characters of the leaders whom Agamemnon addresses. He begins with an address to the army in general, and then turns to individuals. To the brave he urges their secure hopes of conquest, since the gods must punish perjury; to the timid, their inevitable destruction if the enemy should burn their ships. After this he flies from rank to rank, skilfully addressing each ally, and presents a lively picture of a great mind in the highest emotion. The ancients usually in their feasts divided to the guests in equal portions, except they took particular occasion to show distinction. It was then considered the highest mark of honor to be allotted the best portion of meat and wine, and to be allowed an exemption from the laws of the feast in drinking wine unmingled and without measure."], "Who proposes returning to Greece because the war was a failure?": [" Last came Eumelus drawing to the goal, Himself, his splendid chariot, and his mares660 Driving before him.

The sacredness attached to it gave him hopes that they would not violate his person, should he chance to be taken; and his riches he knew were sufficient to purchase his liberty.

He ceased, and Dolon would have stretch\u2019d his hand Toward his beard, and pleaded hard for life, But with his falchion, rising to the blow,540 On the mid-neck he smote him, cutting sheer Both tendons with a stroke so swift, that ere His tongue had ceased, his head was in the dust. [18] They took his helmet clothed with ferret\u2019s felt, Stripp\u2019d off his wolf-skin, seized his bow and spear,545 And brave Ulysses lifting in his hand The trophy to Minerva, pray\u2019d and said: Hail Goddess; these are thine! for thee of all Who in Olympus dwell, we will invoke First to our aid. Now also guide our steps,550 Propitious, to the Thracian tents and steeds.", " Instant, at the voice, Wild stir arose and clamorous uproar Of fast-assembling Trojans. Deeds they saw\u2014620 Terrible deeds, and marvellous perform\u2019d, But not their authors\u2014they had sought the ships. Meantime arrived where they had slain the spy Of Hector, there Ulysses, dear to Jove, The coursers stay\u2019d, and, leaping to the ground,625 The son of Tydeus in Ulysses\u2019 hands The arms of Dolon placed foul with his blood, Then vaulted light into his seat again. He lash\u2019d the steeds, they, not unwilling, flew To the deep-bellied barks, as to their home.630 First Nestor heard the sound, and thus he said. Friends! Counsellors! and leaders of the Greeks! False shall I speak, or true?\u2014but speak I must. The echoing sound of hoofs alarms my ear. Oh, that Ulysses, and brave Diomede635 This moment might arrive drawn into camp By Trojan steeds! But, ah, the dread I feel! Lest some disaster have for ever quell\u2019d 256 In yon rude host those noblest of the Greeks."], "What does Zeus do to the Achaeans that causes them to panic?": [" In _antiquity_, a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_, any sacrifice of a large number of victims. [The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids. The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue.", " The swarms of locusts that sometimes invade whole countries in the East, have often been described. It seems that the ancient mode of exterminating them was, to kindle a fire, and thus drive them into a lake or river. The simile illustrates in the most striking manner the panic caused by Achilles.\u2014Felton. According to the Scholiast, Arisba was a city of Thrace, and near to the Hellespont; but according to Eustathius, a city of Troas, inhabited by a colony from Mitylene. It was an ancient custom to cast living horses into rivers, to honor, as it were, the rapidity of their streams. This gives us an idea of the superior strength of Achilles. His spear pierced so deep in the ground, that another hero of great strength could not disengage it, but immediately after, Achilles draws it with the utmost ease.

BOOK V. 106 ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH BOOK. Diomede is extraordinarily distinguished. He kills Pandarus, who had violated the truce, and wounds first Venus and then Mars.", " It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from the Gods forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their general at their head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon this hinge turns the whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of Patroclus, and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles. The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents. He gives Achilles the pleasure of seeing that the Greeks could not carry on the war without his assistance, and upon this depends the great catastrophe of the poem. 291 THE ILIAD. BOOK XII. 292 ARGUMENT OF THE TWELFTH BOOK. The Trojans assail the ramparts, and Hector forces the gates. 293 BOOK XII. So was Men\u0153tius\u2019 gallant son employ\u2019d Healing Eurypylus.

Achilles, at the suit of Patroclus, grants him his own armor, and permission to lead the Myrmidons to battle. They, sallying, repulse the Trojans. Patroclus slays Sarpedon, and Hector, when Apollo had first stripped off his armor and Euphorbus wounded him, slays Patroclus. 389 BOOK XVI. Such contest for that gallant bark they waged. Meantime Patroclus, standing at the side Of the illustrious Chief Achilles, wept Fast as a crystal fountain from the height Of some rude rock pours down its rapid[1] stream.5 Divine Achilles with compassion moved Mark\u2019d him, and in wing\u2019d accents thus began. [2] Who weeps Patroclus like an infant girl Who, running at her mother\u2019s side, entreats To be uplifted in her arms?

BOOK XVII. 422 ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK. Sharp contest ensues around the body of Patroclus. Hector puts on the armor of Achilles. Menelaus, having dispatched Antilochus to Achilles with news of the death of Patroclus, returns to the battle, and, together with Meriones, bears Patroclus off the field, while the Ajaces cover their retreat. 423 BOOK XVII. Nor Menelaus, Atreus\u2019 valiant son, Knew not how Men\u0153tiades had fallen By Trojan hands in battle; forth he rush\u2019d All bright in burnish\u2019d armor through his van, And as some heifer with maternal fears5 Now first acquainted, compasses around Her young one murmuring, with tender moan, So moved the hero of the amber locks Around Patroclus, before whom his spear Advancing and broad shield, he death denounced10 On all opposers; neither stood the son Spear-famed of Panthus inattentive long To slain Patroclus, but approach\u2019d the dead, And warlike Menelaus thus bespake.", " He twenty men (Although a learner yet of martial feats,990 And by his steeds then first to battle borne) Dismounted.

First threw a lance at thee, which yet life Quell\u2019d not; then snatching hasty from the wound His ashen beam, he ran into the crowd,995 Nor dared confront in fight even the unarm\u2019d Patroclus. But Patroclus, by the lance, And by the stroke of an immortal hand Subdued, fell back toward his ranks again. Then, soon as Hector the retreat perceived1000 Of brave Patroclus wounded, issuing forth From his own phalanx, he approach\u2019d and drove A spear right through his body at the waist.

There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller."], "What do Hector and Paris find when they get to the left end of the line?": [" Him Hebe bathed, and with divine attire Graceful adorn\u2019d; when at the side of Jove Again his glorious seat sublime he took.

BOOK VI. 140 ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK. The battle is continued. The Trojans being closely pursued, Hector by the advice of Helenus enters Troy, and recommends it to Hecuba to go in solemn procession to the temple of Minerva; she with the matrons goes accordingly. Hector takes the opportunity to find out Paris, and exhorts him to return to the field of battle. An interview succeeds between Hector and Andromache, and Paris, having armed himself in the mean time, comes up with Hector at the close of it, when they sally from the gate together. 141 BOOK VI. Thus was the field forsaken by the Gods.", " For, spacious though it were, the shore alone That fleet sufficed not, incommoding much The people; wherefore they had ranged the ships40 Line above line gradual, and the bay Between both promontories, all was fill\u2019d. They, therefore, curious to survey the fight, Came forth together, leaning on the spear, When Nestor met them; heavy were their hearts,45 And at the sight of him still more alarm\u2019d, Whom royal Agamemnon thus bespake. Neleian Nestor, glory of the Greeks! What moved thee to forsake yon bloody field, And urged thee hither? Cause I see of fear,50 Lest furious Hector even now his threat Among the Trojans publish\u2019d, verify, That he would never enter Ilium more Till he had burn\u2019d our fleet, and slain ourselves. So threaten\u2019d Hector, and shall now perform.55 Alas! alas! the Achaians brazen-greaved All, like Achilles, have deserted me Resentful, and decline their fleet\u2019s defence.

Haste, seek the field This moment, lest, the next, all Ilium blaze.405 To whom thus Paris, graceful as a God. Since, Hector, thou hast charged me with a fault, And not unjustly, I will answer make, And give thou special heed. That here I sit, The cause is sorrow, which I wish\u2019d to soothe410 In secret, not displeasure or revenge. I tell thee also, that even now my wife Was urgent with me in most soothing terms That I would forth to battle; and myself, Aware that victory oft changes sides,415 That course prefer.", " He has, in imagination, already forced the Grecian entrenchments, set the fleet in flames, and destroyed the whole army. From this speech, it may be gathered that women were accustomed to loosen the horses from the chariot, on their return from battle, and feed them; and from line 214, unless it is spurious, it seems that the provender was sometimes mixed with wine. It is most probable, however, that the line is not genuine.\u2014Felton. Homer describes a princess so tender in her love to her husband, that she meets him on his return from every battle, and, in the joy of seeing him again, feeds his horses with bread and wine, as an acknowledgment to them for bringing him back.\u2014Dacier.

We can hardly imagine that a poem of the length and general excellence of the Iliad, could be composed without the aid of writing; and yet, we are told, there are well-authenticated examples of such works being preserved and handed down by traditional memory. However this may be, we know that the Oriental nations were in possession of the art of alphabetical writing it a very early period, and before the Trojan war. It cannot, then, seem very improbable, that the authors of the Iliad should also have been acquainted with it.\u2014Felton. The Solymi were an ancient nation inhabiting the mountainous parts of Asia Minor, between Lycia and Pisidia. Pliny mentions them as having become extinct in his time.

[The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids. The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ILIAD *** Produced by Ted Garvin, Melissa Er-Raqabi, Fred Robinson and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net THE ILIAD OF HOMER, TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE BY WILLIAM COWPER.

Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter. The poet, throughout this book, maintains a simple, unadorned style, but highly descriptive, and happily adapted to the nature of the subject.\u2014Felton. 029 THE ILIAD. BOOK II. 030 ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. Jupiter, in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Grecians in answer to the prayer of Thetis, deceives Agamemnon by a dream. He, in consequence of it, calls a council, the result of which is that the army shall go forth to battle. Thersites is mutinous, and is chastised by Ulysses. Ulysses, Nestor, and Agamemnon, harangue the people; and preparation is made for battle.", " Juno, forbear. Indulge not always wrath Against the Gods. They shall not share alike, And in the same proportion our regards. Yet even Hector was the man in Troy90 Most favor\u2019d by the Gods, and him no less I also loved, for punctual were his gifts To us; mine altar never miss\u2019d from him Libation, or the steam of sacrifice, The meed allotted to us from of old.95 But steal him not, since by Achilles\u2019 eye 592 Unseen ye cannot, who both day and night Watches[3] him, as a mother tends her son.

Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons Of Dardanus, oh be ye men, my friends!225 Now summon all your fortitude, while I Put on the armor of Achilles, won From the renown\u2019d Patroclus slain by me. So saying, illustrious Hector from the clash Of spears withdrew, and with his swiftest pace230 Departing, overtook, not far remote, The bearers of Achilles\u2019 arms to Troy. Apart from all the horrors of the field Standing, he changed his armor; gave his own To be by them to sacred Ilium borne,235 And the immortal arms of Peleus\u2019 son Achilles, by the ever-living Gods To Pele\u00fcs given, put on. Those arms the Sire, Now old himself, had on his son conferr\u2019d 430 But in those arms his son grew never old.240 Him, therefore, soon as cloud-assembler Jove Saw glittering in divine Achilles\u2019 arms, Contemplative he shook his brows, and said, Ah hapless Chief! thy death, although at hand, Nought troubles thee.", " It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from the Gods forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their general at their head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon this hinge turns the whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of Patroclus, and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles. The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents. He gives Achilles the pleasure of seeing that the Greeks could not carry on the war without his assistance, and upon this depends the great catastrophe of the poem. 291 THE ILIAD. BOOK XII. 292 ARGUMENT OF THE TWELFTH BOOK. The Trojans assail the ramparts, and Hector forces the gates. 293 BOOK XII. So was Men\u0153tius\u2019 gallant son employ\u2019d Healing Eurypylus.

Know this thyself Also; the hour is nigh when thou shalt ask990 In prayer to Jove and all the Gods of heaven, That speed more rapid than the falcon\u2019s flight May wing thy coursers, while, exciting dense The dusty plain, they whirl thee back to Troy.", " Hector takes measures for the security of Troy during the night, and prepares his host for an assault to be made on the Grecian camp in the morning. 185 BOOK VIII. The saffron-mantled morning[1] now was spread O\u2019er all the nations, when the Thunderer Jove On the deep-fork\u2019d Olympian topmost height Convened the Gods in council, amid whom He spake himself; they all attentive heard.5 Gods! Goddesses! Inhabitants of heaven! Attend; I make my secret purpose known. Let neither God nor Goddess interpose My counsel to rescind, but with one heart Approve it, that it reach, at once, its end.10 Whom I shall mark soever from the rest Withdrawn, that he may Greeks or Trojans aid, Disgrace shall find him; shamefully chastised He shall return to the Olympian heights, Or I will hurl him deep into the gulfs15 Of gloomy Tartarus, where Hell shuts fast Her iron gates, and spreads her brazen floor, As far below the shades, as earth from heaven.", " For, while they press\u2019d to pass, they spied a bird Sublime in air, an eagle. Right between Both hosts he soar\u2019d (the Trojan on his left) A serpent bearing in his pounces clutch\u2019d250 Enormous, dripping blood, but lively still And mindful of revenge; for from beneath 300 The eagle\u2019s breast, updarting fierce his head, Fast by the throat he struck him; anguish-sick The eagle cast him down into the space255 Between the hosts, and, clanging loud his plumes As the wind bore him, floated far away. Shudder\u2019d the Trojans viewing at their feet The spotted serpent ominous, and thus Polydamas to dauntless Hector spake.260 Ofttimes in council, Hector, thou art wont To censure me, although advising well; Nor ought the private citizen, I confess, Either in council or in war to indulge Loquacity, but ever to employ265 All his exertions in support of thine. Yet hear my best opinion once again. Proceed we not in our attempt against The Grecian fleet.", " Thrice, swift Achilles sprang to the assault Impetuous, thrice the pitchy cloud he smote, And at his fourth assault, godlike in act,550 And terrible in utterance, thus exclaim\u2019d. Dog! thou art safe, and hast escaped again; But narrowly, and by the aid once more Of Ph\u0153bus, without previous suit to whom Thou venturest never where the javelin sings.555 But when we next encounter, then expect, 509 If one of all in heaven aid also me, To close thy proud career. Meantime I seek Some other, and assail e\u2019en whom I may. So saying, he pierced the neck of Dryops through,560 And at his feet he fell. Him there he left, And turning on a valiant warrior huge, Philetor\u2019s son, Demuchus, in the knee Pierced, and detain\u2019d him by the planted spear, Till with his sword he smote him, and he died.565 Laogonus and Dardanus he next Assaulted, sons of Bias; to the ground Dismounting both, one with his spear he slew, The other with his falchion at a blow."], "What does Agamemnon give Achilles when he returns?": [" To Ulysses he returns a flat denial, and threatens to leave the Trojan shore in the morning. To Ph\u0153nix his answer is more gentle. After Ajax has spoken, he seems determined not to depart, but yet refuses to bear arms, except in defence of his own squadron. Footnotes for Book X: With slight alteration, Homer here repeats the verses that open the 2d Book, and ascribes to Agamemnon the same watchfulness over men that Jupiter had over the gods. Menelaus starts a design, which is afterwards proposed by Nestor in council. The poet knew that the project would come with greater weight from the age of the one than from the youth of the other, and that the valiant would be ready to engage in the enterprise suggested by so venerable a counsellor. Agamemnon is uniformly represented as an example of brotherly affection, and at all times defends Menelaus. [\u03a3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u2014seems to have been a hollow iron with a point, fitted to the obtuse end of the spear, for the purpose of planting that end of it in the ground.", " From this we learn that the Lydians and Carians were famous for their skill in dying purple, and that their women excelled in works of ivory; and also that there were certain ornaments that only kings and princes were privileged to wear. This speech of Agamemnon over his wounded brother, is full of noble power and touching eloquence. The Trojans have violated a truce sanctioned by a solemn sacrifice to the gods. The reflection that such perjury cannot pass with impunity, but that Jove will, sooner or later, punish it, occurs first to the mind of the warrior. In the excitement of the moment, he predicts that the day will surely come when sacred Troy shall fall. From this impetuous feeling his mind suddenly returns to the condition of his brother, and imagines with much pathos, the consequences that will follow from his death, and ends with the wish, that the earth may open before him when that time shall come.\u2014Felton.", " Of thy proper stores Hereafter give to him a richer prize Than this, or give it now, so shall the Greeks685 Applaud thee; but this mare yield I to none; Stand forth the Grecian who desires to win That recompense, and let him fight with me. He ended, and Achilles, godlike Chief, Smiled on him, gratulating his success,690 Whom much he loved; then, ardent, thus replied. Antilochus! if thou wouldst wish me give Eumelus of my own, even so I will. I will present to him my corslet bright Won from Asterop\u00e6us, edged around695 With glittering tin; a precious gift, and rare. So saying, he bade Automedon his friend Produce it from the tent; he at his word Departing, to Achilles brought the spoil, Which at his hands Eumelus glad received.700 Then, stung with grief, and with resentment fired Immeasurable, Menelaus rose To charge Antilochus. His herald gave The sceptre to his hand, and (silence bidden To all) the godlike hero thus began.705 Antilochus!", " He said; then pressing with his heel the trunk1055 Supine, and backward thursting it, he drew His glittering weapon from the wound, nor stay\u2019d, But lance in hand, the godlike charioteer Pursued of swift \u00c6acides, on fire To smite Automedon; but him the steeds1060 Immortal, rapid, by the Gods conferr\u2019d (A glorious gift) on Peleus, snatch\u2019d away. 421 THE ILIAD. BOOK XVII. 422 ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK. Sharp contest ensues around the body of Patroclus. Hector puts on the armor of Achilles. Menelaus, having dispatched Antilochus to Achilles with news of the death of Patroclus, returns to the battle, and, together with Meriones, bears Patroclus off the field, while the Ajaces cover their retreat. 423 BOOK XVII. Nor Menelaus, Atreus\u2019 valiant son, Knew not how Men\u0153tiades had fallen By Trojan hands in battle; forth he rush\u2019d All bright in burnish\u2019d armor through his van, And as some heifer with maternal fears5 Now first acquainted, compasses around Her young one murmuring, with tender moan, So moved the hero of the amber locks Around Patroclus, before whom his spear Advancing and broad shield, he death denounced10 On all opposers; neither stood the son Spear-famed of Panthus inattentive long To slain Patroclus, but approach\u2019d the dead, And warlike Menelaus thus bespake."], "Why does Achilles reprimand his horses?": [" This alludes to the custom of placing columns upon tombs, on which were frequently represented chariots with two or four horses. The horses standing still to mourn for their master, could not be more finely represented than by the dumb sorrow of images standing over a tomb. Perhaps the very posture in which these horses are described, their heads bowed down, and their manes falling in the dust, has an allusion to the attitude in which those statues on monuments were usually represented; there are bas-reliefs that favor this conjecture. [The Latin plural of Ajax is sometimes necessary, because the English plural\u2014Ajaxes\u2014would be insupportable.]\u2014Tr. [Le\u00eftus was another chief of the B\u0153otians.]\u2014Tr.

The fact was that Idomeneus had left the camp on foot, and was on foot when Hector prepared to throw at him.", " He has, in imagination, already forced the Grecian entrenchments, set the fleet in flames, and destroyed the whole army. From this speech, it may be gathered that women were accustomed to loosen the horses from the chariot, on their return from battle, and feed them; and from line 214, unless it is spurious, it seems that the provender was sometimes mixed with wine. It is most probable, however, that the line is not genuine.\u2014Felton. Homer describes a princess so tender in her love to her husband, that she meets him on his return from every battle, and, in the joy of seeing him again, feeds his horses with bread and wine, as an acknowledgment to them for bringing him back.\u2014Dacier. These were the arms that Diomede had received from Glaucus. [None daring to keep the field, and all striving to enter the gates together, they obstructed their own passage, and were, of course, compelled into the narrow interval between the foss and rampart.", " But thy speech420 Was light as is the wind, and rashly made.

In like manner Diana and the river-god Scamander sometimes play a very undignified part. Apollo alone uniformly maintains his dignity.\u2014Muller. This is a very beautiful soliloquy of Agenor, such as would naturally arise in the soul of a brave man going upon a desperate enterprise. From the conclusion it is evident, that the story of Achilles being invulnerable except in the heel, is an invention of a later age. Footnotes for Book XXII: This simile is very striking.

No moral is so evident throughout the Iliad, as the dependence of man upon divine assistance and protection. Apollo saves Hector from the dart, and Minerva Ulysses.
