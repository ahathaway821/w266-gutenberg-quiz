{"Who sends theplague to the Achaean camp near the beginning of The Iliad?": [" Him there they found Beneath the shadow of his bark reclined,415 Nor glad at their approach. Trembling they stood, In presence of the royal Chief, awe-struck, Nor questioned him or spake. He not the less Knew well their embassy, and thus began. Ye heralds, messengers of Gods and men,420 Hail, and draw near! I bid you welcome both. I blame not you; the fault is his alone Who sends you to conduct the damsel hence Bris\u00ebis. Go, Patroclus, generous friend! Lead forth, and to their guidance give the maid.425 But be themselves my witnesses before The blessed Gods, before mankind, before The ruthless king, should want of me be felt To save the host from havoc[25]\u2014Oh, his thoughts Are madness all; intelligence or skill,430 Forecast or retrospect, how best the camp May be secured from inroad, none hath he. He ended, nor Patroclus disobey\u2019d, But leading beautiful Bris\u00ebis forth Into their guidance gave her; loth she went435 From whom she loved, and looking oft behind. Then wept Achilles, and apart from all, With eyes directed to the gloomy Deep And arms outstretch\u2019d, his mother suppliant sought. Since, mother, though ordain\u2019d so soon to die,440 I am thy son, I might with cause expect Some honor at the Thunderer\u2019s hands, but none To me he shows, whom Agamemnon, Chief 018 Of the Achaians, hath himself disgraced, Seizing by violence my just reward.445 So prayed he weeping, whom his mother heard Within the gulfs of Ocean where she sat Beside her ancient sire.", " As the spring that succeeded was a happier spring, so it led to a happier summer. We had no longer air and exercise alone, but exercise and Homer hand in hand. He even followed us thrice to the sea: and whether our walks were \u201con the margin of the land, O\u2019er the green summit of the\u201d cliffs, \u201cwhose base Beats back the roaring surge,\u201d \u201cor on the shore Of the untillable and barren deep,\u201d they were always within hearing of his magic song. About the middle of this busy summer, the revisal of the Iliad was brought to a close; and on the very next day, the 24th of July, the correction of the Odyssey commenced,\u2014a xx morning rendered memorable by a kind and unexpected visit from the patroness of that work, the Dowager Lady Spencer! It is not my intention to detain the reader with a progressive account of the Odyssey revised, as circumstantial as that of the Iliad, because it went on smoothly from beginning to end, and was finished in less than eight months. I cannot deliver these volumes to the public without feeling emotions of gratitude toward Heaven, in recollecting how often this corrected Work has appeared to me an instrument of Divine mercy, to mitigate the sufferings of my excellent relation. Its progress in our private hours was singularly medicinal to his mind: may its presentment to the Public prove not less conducive to the honor of the departed Author, who has every claim to my veneration!", " To my inexpressible astonishment and joy, I surprised him, one morning, with the Iliad in his hand; and with an excess of delight, which I am still more unable to describe, I the next day discovered that he had been writing.\u2014Were I to mention one of the happiest moments of my life, it might be that which introduced me to the following lines:\u2014 Mistaken meanings corrected, admonente G.

He had written these lines with a pencil, on a leaf at the end of his Iliad; and when I reflected on the cause which had given them birth, I could not but admire its disproportion to the effect. What the voice of persuasion had failed in for a year, accident had silently accomplished in a single day. The circumstance I allude to was this: I received a copy of the Iliad and Odyssey of Pope, then recently published by the Editor above mentioned, with illustrative and critical notes of his own.", " In the addition of notes I have availed myself of the learning of various commentators (Pope, Coleridge, M\u00fcller, etc.) and covet no higher praise than the approval of my judgment in the selection. Those bearing the signature E.P.P., were furnished by my friend Miss Peabody, of Boston. I would also acknowledge my obligations to C.C. Felton, Eliot Professor of Greek in Harvard University. It should be observed, that the remarks upon the language of the poem refer to it in the original. For a definite treatment of the character of each deity introduced in the Iliad, and for the fable of the Judgment of Paris, which was the primary cause of the Trojan war, the reader is referred to \u201cGrecian and Roman Mythology.\u201d It is intended that this edition of the Iliad shall be followed by a similar one of the Odyssey, provided sufficient encouragement is given by the demand for the present volume. xxv CONTENTS.

XXIV. 001 THE ILIAD OF HOMER, TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE. 002 ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK. The book opens with an account of a pestilence that prevailed in the Grecian camp, and the cause of it is assigned. A council is called, in which fierce altercation takes place between Agamemnon and Achilles. The latter solemnly renounces the field. Agamemnon, by his heralds, demands Bris\u00ebis, and Achilles resigns her."], "Which of the followingcharacters do not engage in one-on-one combat with each other inthe poem?": [" It seemed to me, that here and there, perhaps a slight alteration might satisfy the demands of some, whom I was desirous to please; and I comforted myself with the reflection, that if I still failed to conciliate all, I should yet have no cause to account myself in a singular degree unfortunate. To please an unqualified judge, an author must sacrifice too much; and the attempt to please an uncandid one were altogether hopeless. In one or other of these classes may be ranged all such objectors, as would deprive blank verse of one of its principal advantages, the variety of its pauses; together with all such as deny the good effect, on the whole, of a line, now and then, less harmonious than its fellows. With respect to the pauses, it has been affirmed with an unaccountable rashness, that Homer himself has given me an example of verse without them. Had this been true, it would by no means have concluded against the use of them in an English version of Homer; because, in one language, and in one species of metre, that may be musical, which in another would be found disgusting. But the assertion is totally unfounded. The pauses in Homer\u2019s verse are so frequent and various, that to name another poet, if pauses are a fault, more faulty than he, were, perhaps, impossible. It may even be questioned, if a single passage of ten lines flowing with uninterrupted smoothness could be singled out from all the thousands that he has left us.", " Among others he takes the liberty of mentioning Mr. Cary, whose authority upon such a question is of especial weight, the Translator of Dante being the only one of our countrymen who has ever executed a translation of equal magnitude and not less difficulty, with the same perfect fidelity and admirable skill. In support of this determination, the case of Tasso may be cited as curiously in point. The great Italian poet altered his Jerusalem like Cowper, against his own judgment, in submission to his critics: he made the alteration in the latter years of his life, and in a diseased state of mind; and he proceeded upon the same prescribed rule of smoothing down his versification, and removing all the elisions. The consequence has been that the reconstructed poem is utterly neglected, and has rarely, if ever, been reprinted, except in the two great editions of his collected works; while the original poem has been and continues to be in such demand, that the most diligent bibliographer might vainly attempt to enumerate all the editions through which it has passed. xxiii EDITOR\u2019S NOTE. It will be seen by the Advertisement to Southey\u2019s edition of Cowper\u2019s Translation of the Iliad, that he has the highest opinion of its merits, and that he also gives the preference to Cowper\u2019s unrevised edition. The Editor of the present edition is happy to offer it to the public under the sanction of such high authority.", " The sons of Actor[16] in the chariot-race795 Alone surpass\u2019d me, being two for one, And jealous both lest I should also win That prize, for to the victor charioteer They had assign\u2019d the noblest prize of all. They were twin-brothers, and one ruled the steeds,800 The steeds one ruled,[17] the other lash\u2019d them on. Such once was I; but now, these sports I leave To younger; me submission most befits To withering age, who then outshone the best. But go. The funeral of thy friend with games805 Proceed to celebrate; I accept thy gift With pleasure; and my heart is also glad That thou art mindful evermore of one Who loves thee, and such honor in the sight Yield\u2019st me of all the Greeks, as is my due.810 May the Gods bless thee for it more and more! He spake, and Peleus\u2019 son, when he had heard At large his commendation from the lips Of Nestor, through the assembled Greeks return\u2019d. He next proposed, not lightly to be won,815 The boxer\u2019s prize. He tether\u2019d down a mule, Untamed and hard to tame, but strong to toil, And in her prime of vigor, in the midst; A goblet to the vanquish\u2019d he assign\u2019d, Then stood erect and to the Greeks exclaim\u2019d.820 Atrid\u00e6! and ye Argives brazen-greaved! I call for two bold combatants expert To wage fierce strife for these, with lifted fists 578 Smiting each other. He, who by the aid Of Ph\u0153bus shall o\u2019ertome, and whom the Greeks825 Shall all pronounce victorious, leads the mule Hence to his tent; the vanquish\u2019d takes the cup.", " But if the relations of the murdered person were willing, the criminal, by paying a certain fine, might buy off the exile and remain at home. Ajax sums up this argument with great strength: We see, says he, a brother forgive the murder of his brother, a father that of his son; but Achilles will not forgive the injury offered him by taking away one captive woman. The character of Achilles is well sustained in all his speeches. To Ulysses he returns a flat denial, and threatens to leave the Trojan shore in the morning. To Ph\u0153nix his answer is more gentle. After Ajax has spoken, he seems determined not to depart, but yet refuses to bear arms, except in defence of his own squadron. Footnotes for Book X: With slight alteration, Homer here repeats the verses that open the 2d Book, and ascribes to Agamemnon the same watchfulness over men that Jupiter had over the gods. Menelaus starts a design, which is afterwards proposed by Nestor in council. The poet knew that the project would come with greater weight from the age of the one than from the youth of the other, and that the valiant would be ready to engage in the enterprise suggested by so venerable a counsellor. Agamemnon is uniformly represented as an example of brotherly affection, and at all times defends Menelaus.

All night the leaders of the host of Greece Lay sunk in soft repose, all, save the Chief,[1] The son of Atreus; him from thought to thought Roving solicitous, no sleep relieved. As when the spouse of beauteous Juno, darts5 His frequent fires, designing heavy rain Immense, or hail-storm, or field-whitening snow, Or else wide-throated war calamitous, So frequent were the groans by Atreus\u2019 son Heaved from his inmost heart, trembling with dread.10 For cast he but his eye toward the plain Of Ilium, there, astonish\u2019d he beheld The city fronted with bright fires, and heard Pipes, and recorders, and the hum of war; But when again the Grecian fleet he view\u2019d,15 And thought on his own people, then his hair Uprooted elevating to the Gods, He from his generous bosom groan\u2019d again. At length he thus resolved; of all the Greeks To seek Neleian Nestor first, with whom20 He might, perchance, some plan for the defence Of the afflicted Dana\u00ef devise. Rising, he wrapp\u2019d his tunic to his breast, 238 And to his royal feet unsullied bound His sandals; o\u2019er his shoulders, next, he threw25 Of amplest size a lion\u2019s tawny skin That swept his footsteps, dappled o\u2019er with blood, Then took his spear.", " [This, according to the Scholiast, is a probable sense of \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2.\u2014He derives it \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bd\u03b5\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03ba \u03b3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd.\u2014See Villoisson.]\u2014Tr.

It is said that Lycurgus caused most of the vines of his country to be rooted up, so that his subjects were obliged to mix their wine with water, as it became less plentiful. Hence the fable that Thetis received Bacchus into her bosom. This style of language was according to the manners of the times. Thus Goliath to David, \u201cApproach, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field.\u201d The Orientals still speak in the same manner. Though this comparison may be justly admired for its beauty in the obvious application to the mortality and succession of human life, it seems designed by the poet, in this place, as a proper emblem of the transitory state of families which, by their misfortune or folly, have fallen and decayed, and again appear, in a happier season, to revive and flourish in the fame and virtues of their posterity. In this sense it is a direct answer to the question of Diomede, as well as a proper preface to what Glaticus relates of his own family, which, having become extinct in Corinth, recovers new life in Lycia. The same as Corinth. Some suppose that alphabetical writing was unknown in the Homeric age, and consequently that these signs must have been hieroglyphical marks. The question is a difficult one, and the most distinguished scholars are divided in opinion. We can hardly imagine that a poem of the length and general excellence of the Iliad, could be composed without the aid of writing; and yet, we are told, there are well-authenticated examples of such works being preserved and handed down by traditional memory.", " To my inexpressible astonishment and joy, I surprised him, one morning, with the Iliad in his hand; and with an excess of delight, which I am still more unable to describe, I the next day discovered that he had been writing.\u2014Were I to mention one of the happiest moments of my life, it might be that which introduced me to the following lines:\u2014 Mistaken meanings corrected, admonente G.

We are alarmed at the approach of Dolon, hear his very footsteps, assist the two chiefs in pursuing him, and stop just with the spear that arrests him. We are perfectly acquainted with the situation of all the forces, with the figure in which they lie, with the disposition of Rhesus and the Thracians, with the posture of his chariot and horses. The marshy spot of ground where Dolon is killed, the tamarisk, or aquatic plant upon which they hung his spoils, and the reeds that are heaped together to mark the place, are circumstances the most picturesque imaginable. 259 THE ILIAD. BOOK XI. 260 ARGUMENT OF THE ELEVENTH BOOK. Agamemnon distinguishes himself. He is wounded, and retires. Diomede is wounded by Paris; Ulysses by Socus. Ajax with Menelaus flies to the relief of Ulysses, and Eurypylus, soon after, to the relief of Ajax. While he is employed in assisting Ajax, he is shot in the thigh by Paris, who also wounds Machaon. Nestor conveys Machaon from the field. Achilles dispatches Patroclus to the tent of Nestor, and Nestor takes that occasion to exhort Patroclus to engage in battle, clothed in the armor of Achilles. 261 BOOK XI. Aurora from Tithonus\u2019 side arose With light for heaven and earth, when Jove dispatch\u2019d Discord, the fiery signal in her hand Of battle bearing, to the Grecian fleet.", " Tell them, and the effect shall sure ensue, That I will smite their steeds, and they shall halt Disabled; break their chariot, dash themselves470 Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface The wounds by my avenging bolts impress\u2019d. So shall my blue-eyed daughter learn to dread A father\u2019s anger; but for the offence Of Juno, I resent it less; for she475 Clashes[15] with all my counsels from of old. 199 He ended; Iris with a tempest\u2019s speed From the Id\u00e6an summit soar\u2019d at once To the Olympian; at the open gates Exterior of the mountain many-valed480 She stayed them, and her coming thus declared.

Ah Pallas, progeny of Jove! henceforth No longer, in the cause of mortal men,500 Contend we against Jove.", " Footnotes for Book V: In each battle there is one prominent person who may be called the hero of the day. This arrangement preserves unity, and helps to fix the attention of the reader. The gods sometimes favor one hero, and sometimes another. In this book we have the exploits of Diomede. Assisted by Minerva, he is eminent both for prudence and valor. Sirius. This comparison, among many others, shows how constantly the poet\u2019s attention was directed to the phenomena of nature.\u2014Felton. \u0397\u03b9\u03bf\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9. The chariots were probably very low. We frequently find in the Iliad that a person standing in a chariot is killed (and sometimes by a stroke on the head) by a foot soldier with a sword. This may farther appear from the ease with which they mount or alight, to facilitate which, the chariots were made open behind. That the wheels were small, may be supposed from their custom of taking them off and putting them on. Hebe puts on the wheels of Juno\u2019s chariot, when he called for it in battle. It may be in allusion to the same custom, that it is said in Ex., ch. xiv. : \u201cThe Lord took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them heavily.\u201d That it was very small and light, is evident from a passage in the tenth Il., where Diomede debates whether he shall draw the chariot of Rhesus out of the way, or carry it on his shoulders to a place of safety. [Meges, son of Phyleus.] This whole passage is considered by critics as very beautiful."], "Who kills Dolon?": [" In the council of the Greeks, a wise old man proposes the adventure with an air of deference; in that of the Trojans, a brave young man with an air of authority. The one promises a small gift, but honorable and certain; the other a great one, but uncertain and less honorable, because it is given as a reward. Diomede and Ulysses are inspired with a love of glory; Dolon with the thirst of gain. They proceed with caution and bravery; he with rashness and vanity. They go in conjunction; he alone. They cross the fields out of the road, he follows the common track. In all this there is an admirable contrast, and a moral that strikes every reader at first sight. [Commentators are extremely in the dark, and even Aristarchus seems to have attempted an explanation in vain. The translator does not pretend to have ascertained the distance intended, but only to have given a distance suited to the occasion.]\u2014Tr. Ulysses makes no promise of life, but artfully bids Dolon, who is overpowered by fear, not to think of death. He was so cautious as not to believe a friend just before without an oath, but he trusts an enemy without even a promise. ['\u039f\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03a4\u03c1\u03c9\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u2014As many as are owners of hearths\u2014that is to say, all who are householders here, or natives of the city. ]\u2014Tr It seems barbarous in Diomede thus to have killed Dolon, but Eustathius observes that it was necessary to their success, as his cries might have put the Trojans on their guard.", " Dolon, suspecting nought, ran swiftly by. [15]But when such space was interposed as mules415 Plow in a day (for mules the ox surpass Through fallows deep drawing the ponderous plow) Both ran toward him. Dolon at the sound Stood; for he hoped some Trojan friends at hand From Hector sent to bid him back again.420 But when within spear\u2019s cast, or less they came, 250 Knowing them enemies he turn\u2019d to flight Incontinent, whom they as swift pursued. As two fleet hounds sharp fang\u2019d, train\u2019d to the chase, Hang on the rear of flying hind or hare,425 And drive her, never swerving from the track, Through copses close; she screaming scuds before; So Diomede and dread Ulysses him Chased constant, intercepting his return. And now, fast-fleeting to the ships, he soon430 Had reach\u2019d the guard, but Pallas with new force Inspired Tydides, lest a meaner Greek Should boast that he had smitten Dolon first, And Diomede win only second praise. He poised his lifted spear, and thus exclaim\u2019d.435 Stand! or my spear shall stop thee. Death impends At every step; thou canst not \u2019scape me long. He said, and threw his spear, but by design, Err\u2019d from the man. The polish\u2019d weapon swift O\u2019er-glancing his right shoulder, in the soil440 Stood fixt, beyond him. Terrified he stood, Stammering, and sounding through his lips the clash Of chattering teeth, with visage deadly wan. They panting rush\u2019d on him, and both his hands Seized fast; he wept, and suppliant them bespake.445 Take me alive, and I will pay the price Of my redemption.", " His steeds I saw, the fairest by these eyes Ever beheld, and loftiest; snow itself520 They pass in whiteness, and in speed the winds, With gold and silver all his chariot burns, And he arrived in golden armor clad Stupendous! little suited to the state Of mortal man\u2014fit for a God to wear!525 Now, either lead me to your gallant fleet, Or where ye find me leave me straitly bound Till ye return, and after trial made, Shall know if I have spoken false or true. 253 But him brave Diomede with aspect stern530 Answer\u2019d. Since, Dolon! thou art caught, although Thy tidings have been good, hope not to live; For should we now release thee and dismiss, Thou wilt revisit yet again the fleet A spy or open foe; but smitten once535 By this death-dealing arm, thou shall return To render mischief to the Greeks no more. He ceased, and Dolon would have stretch\u2019d his hand Toward his beard, and pleaded hard for life, But with his falchion, rising to the blow,540 On the mid-neck he smote him, cutting sheer Both tendons with a stroke so swift, that ere His tongue had ceased, his head was in the dust.

The Trojans were required to sacrifice two lambs; one male of a white color to the Sun, as the father of light, and one female and black to the Earth, the mother and nurse of men. That these were the powers to which they sacrificed appears from their being attested by name in the oath. III. 330. Helen\u2019s weaving the events of the Trojan war in a veil is an agreeable fiction; and one might suppose that it was inherited by Homer, and explained in his Iliad.\u2014Dacier. [Not the grasshopper, but an insect well known in hot countries, and which in Italy is called Cic\u00e1la. The grasshopper rests on the ground, but the favorite abode of the Cic\u00e1la is in the trees and hedges.\u2014Tr.] This episode is remarkable for its beauty. The effect of Helen\u2019s appearance upon the aged counsellors is striking and poetical. It must be borne in mind, that Helen was of divine parentage and unfading beauty, and this will explain the enthusiasm which her sight called forth from the old men. The poet\u2019s skill in taking this method of describing the Grecian chieftains is obvious, and the sketches themselves are living and characteristic to a high degree. The reminiscences of the aged Priam, as their names are announced, and the penitential sorrow of the erring Helen, which the sight of her countrymen, and the recollection of her home, her child, her companions, excite in her bosom, are among the most skilful touches of natural feeling.\u2014Felton.", " \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1. \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2. Agamemnon\u2019s anger is that of a lover, and Achilles\u2019 that of a warrior. Agamemnon speaks of Chrys\u00ebis as a beauty whom he values too much to resign. Achilles treats Bris\u00ebis as a slave, whom he is anxious to preserve in point of honor, and as a testimony of his glory. Hence he mentions her only as \u201chis spoil,\u201d \u201cthe reward of war,\u201d etc. ; accordingly he relinquishes her not in grief for a favorite whom he loses, but in sullenness for the injury done him.\u2014Dacier. Jupiter, in the disguise of an ant, deceived Eurymedusa, the daughter of Cleitos. Her son was for this reason called Myrmidon (from \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7\u03be, an ant), and was regarded as the ancestor of the Myrmidons in Thessaly.\u2014Smith. According to the belief of the ancients, the gods were supposed to have a peculiar light in their eyes. That Homer was not ignorant of this opinion appears from his use of it in other places. Minerva is the goddess of the art of war rather than of war itself. And this fable of her descent is an allegory of Achilles restraining his wrath through his consideration of martial law and order. This law in that age, prescribed that a subordinate should not draw his sword upon the commander of all, but allowed a liberty of speech which appears to us moderns rather out of order.\u2014E.P.P.

Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck, By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes470 She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake. Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish Now to ensnare me? Wouldst thou lure me, say, To some fair city of M\u00e6onian name Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still?475 Hast thou some human favorite also there?

As the poet did not intend to draw the character of a perfect man in Achilles, he makes him delighted with the destruction of the Greeks, because it gratified his revenge. That resentment which is the subject of the poem, still presides over every other feeling, even the love of his country. He begins now to pity his countrymen, yet he seems gratified by their distress, because it will contribute to his glory. This onion was very different from the root which now passes under that name. It had a sweet flavor, and was used to impart an agreeable flavor to wine. It is in high repute at the present day in Egypt.\u2014Felton.

Homer here reminds the reader, that Nestor belonged to a former generation of men, who were stronger than the heroes of the war.

He begins with an address to the army in general, and then turns to individuals. To the brave he urges their secure hopes of conquest, since the gods must punish perjury; to the timid, their inevitable destruction if the enemy should burn their ships. After this he flies from rank to rank, skilfully addressing each ally, and presents a lively picture of a great mind in the highest emotion. The ancients usually in their feasts divided to the guests in equal portions, except they took particular occasion to show distinction. It was then considered the highest mark of honor to be allotted the best portion of meat and wine, and to be allowed an exemption from the laws of the feast in drinking wine unmingled and without measure. This custom was much more ancient than the time of the Trojan war, and we find it practised in the banquet given by Joseph to his brethren. [Diverse interpretations are given of this passage. I have adopted that which to me appeared most plausible. It seems to be a caution against the mischiefs that might ensue, should the horses be put under the management of a driver with whom they were unacquainted.\u2014The scholium by Villoisson much countenances this solution.\u2014Tr.] [Here Nestor only mentions the name of Ereuthalion, knowing the present to be an improper time for story-telling; in the seventh book he relates his fight and victory at length.", " More dispatch Had pleased thee more, for such was thy command.

The depressing effect of his sad interview is wearing away from his mind, and he is already prepared for the battle with Ajax, which awaits him. The student who has once read this book, will read it again and again.

It is said in the life of Alexander the Great, that when that prince visited the monuments of the heroes of Troy, and placed a crown upon the tomb of Achilles, his friend Heph\u00e6stion placed another on that of Patroclus; an intimation of his being to Alexander, what Patroclus was to Achilles. It is also said, that Alexander remarked, \u201cAchilles was happy indeed, in having had such a friend to love him when living, and such a poet to celebrate him when dead.\u201d [\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. A word of incomparable force, and that defies translation.] This charge is in keeping with the ambitious character of Achilles. He is unwilling that even his dearest friend should have the honor of conquering Hector. The picture of the situation of Ajax, exhausted by his efforts, pressed by the arms of his assailants and the will of Jupiter, is drawn with much graphic power.\u2014Felton. Argus-slayer. The mythi which we find in the Iliad respecting Mercury, represent him as the god who blessed the land with fertility, which was his attribute in the original worship. He is represented as loving the daughter of Phthiotian Phylas, the possessor of many herds, and by her had Eudorus (or riches) whom the aged Phylas fostered and brought up in his house\u2014quite a significant local mythus, which is here related, like others in the usual tone of heroic mythology.\u2014Muller.", " Hector puts on the armor of Achilles.

Such contest for that gallant bark they waged.

Now, on the golden floor of Jove\u2019s abode The Gods all sat consulting; Hebe them, Graceful, with nectar served;[1] they pledging each His next, alternate quaff\u2019d from cups of gold, And at their ease reclined, look\u2019d down on Troy,5 When, sudden, Jove essay\u2019d by piercing speech Invidious, to enkindle Juno\u2019s ire.

The Trojans were required to sacrifice two lambs; one male of a white color to the Sun, as the father of light, and one female and black to the Earth, the mother and nurse of men. That these were the powers to which they sacrificed appears from their being attested by name in the oath. III. 330. Helen\u2019s weaving the events of the Trojan war in a veil is an agreeable fiction; and one might suppose that it was inherited by Homer, and explained in his Iliad.\u2014Dacier.

The grasshopper rests on the ground, but the favorite abode of the Cic\u00e1la is in the trees and hedges.\u2014Tr.] This episode is remarkable for its beauty. The effect of Helen\u2019s appearance upon the aged counsellors is striking and poetical. It must be borne in mind, that Helen was of divine parentage and unfading beauty, and this will explain the enthusiasm which her sight called forth from the old men. The poet\u2019s skill in taking this method of describing the Grecian chieftains is obvious, and the sketches themselves are living and characteristic to a high degree. The reminiscences of the aged Priam, as their names are announced, and the penitential sorrow of the erring Helen, which the sight of her countrymen, and the recollection of her home, her child, her companions, excite in her bosom, are among the most skilful touches of natural feeling.\u2014Felton.", " So Menelaus spake; and in all hearts Awaken\u2019d joyful hope that there should end War\u2019s long calamities.

It cannot, then, seem very improbable, that the authors of the Iliad should also have been acquainted with it.\u2014Felton. The Solymi were an ancient nation inhabiting the mountainous parts of Asia Minor, between Lycia and Pisidia. Pliny mentions them as having become extinct in his time. It was the custom in ancient times, upon the performance of any signal service by kings or great men, for the public to grant them a tract of land as a reward. When Sarpedon, in the 12th Book, exhorts Glaucus to behave valiantly, he reminds him of these possessions granted by his countrymen. The laws of hospitality were considered so sacred, that a friendship contracted under their observance was preferred to the ties of consanguinity and alliance, and regarded as obligatory even to the third and fourth generation. Diomede and Glaucus here became friends, on the ground of their grandfathers having been mutual guests. The presents made on these occasions were preserved by families, as it was considered obligatory to transmit them as memorials to their children.

When Cilicia\u2019s city, Thebes The populous, was by Achilles sack\u2019d. He slew my father; yet his gorgeous arms510 Stripp\u2019d not through reverence of him, but consumed, Arm\u2019d as it was, his body on the pile, And heap\u2019d his tomb, which the Oreades, Jove\u2019s daughters, had with elms inclosed around. [29] My seven brothers, glory of our house,515 All in one day descended to the shades; For brave Achilles,[30] while they fed their herds And snowy flocks together, slew them all. My mother, Queen of the well-wooded realm Of Hypoplacian Thebes, her hither brought520 Among his other spoils, he loosed again At an inestimable ransom-price, But by Diana pierced, she died at home.", " How, then, had Hector his impending fate Eluded, had not Ph\u0153bus, at his last,235 Last effort meeting him, his strength restored, And wing\u2019d for flight his agile limbs anew? The son of Peleus, as he ran, his brows Shaking, forbad the people to dismiss A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand240 Piercing him, should usurp the foremost praise. But when the fourth time to those rivulets. They came, then lifting high his golden scales, Two lots the everlasting Father placed Within them, for Achilles one, and one245 For Hector, balancing the doom of both. Grasping it in the midst, he raised the beam. Down went the fatal day of Hector, down To Ades, and Apollo left his side. Then blue-eyed Pallas hasting to the son250 Of Peleus, in wing\u2019d accents him address\u2019d. Now, dear to Jove, Achilles famed in arms! I hope that, fierce in combat though he be, We shall, at last, slay Hector, and return Crown\u2019d with great glory to the fleet of Greece.255 No fear of his deliverance now remains, Not even should the King of radiant shafts, Apollo, toil in supplication, roll\u2019d 543 And roll\u2019d again[11] before the Thunderer\u2019s feet. But stand, recover breath; myself, the while,260 Shall urge him to oppose thee face to face. So Pallas spake, whom joyful he obey\u2019d, And on his spear brass-pointed lean\u2019d. But she, (Achilles left) to noble Hector pass\u2019d, And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned265 Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear In accents, as of pity, thus address\u2019d."], "Which of thefollowing do not appear on Achilles\u2019 new shield?": [" Ajax, next,295 Heroic Chief, hurl\u2019d his long shadow\u2019d spear And struck the oval shield of Priam\u2019s son. Through his bright disk the weapon tempest-driven Glided, and in his hauberk-rings infixt At his soft flank, ripp\u2019d wide his vest within.300 Inclined oblique he \u2019scaped the dreadful doom Then each from other\u2019s shield his massy spear Recovering quick, like lions hunger-pinch\u2019d Or wild boars irresistible in force, They fell to close encounter. Priam\u2019s son305 The shield of Ajax at its centre smote, But fail\u2019d to pierce it, for he bent his point. Sprang Ajax then, and meeting full the targe Of Hector, shock\u2019d him; through it and beyond He urged the weapon with its sliding edge310 Athwart his neck, and blood was seen to start. But still, for no such cause, from battle ceased Crest-tossing Hector, but retiring, seized 174 A huge stone angled sharp and black with age That on the champain lay. The bull-hide guard315 Sevenfold of Ajax with that stone he smote Full on its centre; sang the circling brass. Then Ajax far a heavier stone upheaved; He whirled it, and with might immeasurable Dismiss\u2019d the mass, which with a mill-stone weight320 Sank through the shield of Hector, and his knees Disabled; with his shield supine he fell, But by Apollo raised, stood soon again. And now, with swords they had each other hewn, Had not the messengers of Gods and men325 The heralds wise, Id\u00e6us on the part Of Ilium, and Talthybius for the Greeks, Advancing interposed.", " Ajax advancing like a tower his shield Sevenfold, approach\u2019d. It was the labor\u2019d work Of Tychius, armorer of matchless skill, Who dwelt in Hyla; coated with the hides260 Of seven high-pamper\u2019d bulls that shield he framed For Ajax, and the disk plated with brass. Advancing it before his breast, the son Of Telamon approach\u2019d the Trojan Chief, And face to face, him threatening, thus began.265 Now, Hector, prove, by me alone opposed, What Chiefs the Dana\u00ef can furnish forth In absence of the lion-hearted prince Achilles, breaker of the ranks of war. He, in his billow-cleaving barks incensed270 Against our leader Agamemnon, lies; But warriors of my measure, who may serve To cope with thee, we want not; numerous such Are found amongst us. But begin the fight. To whom majestic Hector fierce in arms.275 Ajax! heroic leader of the Greeks! Offspring of Telamon! essay not me 173 With words to terrify, as I were boy. Or girl unskill\u2019d in war;[9] I am a man Well exercised in battle, who have shed280 The blood of many a warrior, and have learn\u2019d, From hand to hand shifting my shield, to fight Unwearied; I can make a sport of war, In standing fight adjusting all my steps To martial measures sweet, or vaulting light285 Into my chariot, thence can urge the foe. Yet in contention with a Chief like thee I will employ no stratagem, or seek To smite thee privily, but with a stroke (If I may reach thee) visible to all.290 So saying, he shook, then hurl\u2019d his massy spear At Ajax, and his broad shield sevenfold On its eighth surface of resplendent brass Smote full; six hides the unblunted weapon pierced, But in the seventh stood rooted.", " The Pelian ash Started right through the buckler, and it rang. \u00c6neas crouch\u2019d terrified, and his shield Thrust farther from him; but the rapid beam Bursting both borders of the ample disk,345 Glanced o\u2019er his back, and plunged into the soil. He \u2019scaped it, and he stood; but, as he stood, With horror infinite the weapon saw Planted so near him. Then, Achilles drew His falchion keen, and with a deafening shout350 Sprang on him; but \u00c6neas seized a stone Heavy and huge, a weight to overcharge Two men (such men as are accounted strong Now) but he wielded it with ease, alone. Then had \u00c6neas, as Achilles came355 Impetuous on, smitten, although in vain, His helmet or his shield, and Peleus\u2019 son Had with his falchion him stretch\u2019d at his feet, But that the God of Ocean quick perceived His peril, and the Immortals thus bespake.360 I pity brave \u00c6neas, who shall soon, Slain by Achilles, see the realms below, By smooth suggestions of Apollo lured To danger, such as he can ne\u2019er avert. But wherefore should the Chief, guiltless himself,365 Die for the fault of others? at no time His gifts have fail\u2019d, grateful to all in heaven. Come, therefore, and let us from death ourselves Rescue him, lest if by Achilles\u2019 arm This hero perish, Jove himself be wroth;370 For he is destined to survive, lest all The house of Dardanus (whom Jove beyond All others loved, his sons of woman born) Fail with \u00c6neas, and be found no more.", " These chariots were used by the deities only on occasion of a long journey, or when they wished to appear with state and magnificence. Ordinarily they were transported from place to place by the aid of their golden sandals, with the exception of the \u201csilver-footed Thetis,\u201d to whom they seem to have been superfluous. When at home, the gods were barefoot, according to the custom of the age, as we see from various representations of antique art. [These which I have called crescents, were a kind of hook of a semicircular form, to which the reins were occasionally fastened.\u2014Tr.] The Greeks borrowed the vest and shield of Minerva from the Lybians, only with this difference: the Lybian shield was fringed with thongs of leather, and the Grecian with serpents.\u2014Herodotus. This expression (the gates of Heaven) is in the eastern manner, and common in the Scriptures. [\u0391\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5.] Every thing that enters the dark empire of Hades disappears, and is seen no more; hence the figurative expression, to put on Pluto\u2019s helmet; that is to become invisible. Footnotes for Book VI: The Simo\u00efs and Xanthus were two rivers of the Troad, which form a junction before they reached the Hellespont. The Simo\u00efs rose in Mt. Ida, and the Xanthus had its origin near Troy.\u2014Felton. Ajax commences his exploits immediately on the departure of the gods from the battle. It is observed of this hero, that he is never assisted by the deities."], "With which immortaldoes Achilles engage in one-on-one combat?": [" [12] Some neighbor chief, it may be, even now Oppresses him, and there is none at hand, No friend to suocor him in his distress.615 Yet, doubtless, hearing that Achilles lives, He still rejoices, hoping, day by day, That one day he shall see the face again Of his own son from distant Troy return\u2019d. But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons,620 So late the flower of Ilium, all are slain. When Greece came hither, I had fifty sons; Nineteen were children of one bed, the rest Born of my concubines. A numerous house! But fiery Mars hath thinn\u2019d it. One I had,625 One, more than all my sons the strength of Troy, Whom standing for his country thou hast slain\u2014 Hector\u2014his body to redeem I come Into Achaia\u2019s fleet, bringing, myself, Ransom inestimable to thy tent.630 Reverence the Gods, Achilles! recollect Thy father; for his sake compassion show To me more pitiable still, who draw Home to my lips (humiliation yet Unseen on earth) his hand who slew my son.635 So saying, he waken\u2019d in his soul regret Of his own sire; softly he placed his hand On Priam\u2019s hand, and push\u2019d him gently away. 607 Remembrance melted both. Rolling before Achilles\u2019 feet, Priam his son deplored640 Wide-slaughtering Hector, and Achilles wept By turns his father, and by turns his friend Patroclus; sounds of sorrow fill\u2019d the tent. But when, at length satiate, Achilles felt His heart from grief, and all his frame relieved,645 Upstarting from his seat, with pity moved Of Priam\u2019s silver locks and silver beard, He raised the ancient father by his hand, Whom in wing\u2019d accents kind he thus bespake.", " But if the relations of the murdered person were willing, the criminal, by paying a certain fine, might buy off the exile and remain at home. Ajax sums up this argument with great strength: We see, says he, a brother forgive the murder of his brother, a father that of his son; but Achilles will not forgive the injury offered him by taking away one captive woman. The character of Achilles is well sustained in all his speeches. To Ulysses he returns a flat denial, and threatens to leave the Trojan shore in the morning. To Ph\u0153nix his answer is more gentle. After Ajax has spoken, he seems determined not to depart, but yet refuses to bear arms, except in defence of his own squadron. Footnotes for Book X: With slight alteration, Homer here repeats the verses that open the 2d Book, and ascribes to Agamemnon the same watchfulness over men that Jupiter had over the gods. Menelaus starts a design, which is afterwards proposed by Nestor in council. The poet knew that the project would come with greater weight from the age of the one than from the youth of the other, and that the valiant would be ready to engage in the enterprise suggested by so venerable a counsellor. Agamemnon is uniformly represented as an example of brotherly affection, and at all times defends Menelaus. [\u03a3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u2014seems to have been a hollow iron with a point, fitted to the obtuse end of the spear, for the purpose of planting that end of it in the ground.", " It seemed to me, that here and there, perhaps a slight alteration might satisfy the demands of some, whom I was desirous to please; and I comforted myself with the reflection, that if I still failed to conciliate all, I should yet have no cause to account myself in a singular degree unfortunate. To please an unqualified judge, an author must sacrifice too much; and the attempt to please an uncandid one were altogether hopeless. In one or other of these classes may be ranged all such objectors, as would deprive blank verse of one of its principal advantages, the variety of its pauses; together with all such as deny the good effect, on the whole, of a line, now and then, less harmonious than its fellows. With respect to the pauses, it has been affirmed with an unaccountable rashness, that Homer himself has given me an example of verse without them. Had this been true, it would by no means have concluded against the use of them in an English version of Homer; because, in one language, and in one species of metre, that may be musical, which in another would be found disgusting. But the assertion is totally unfounded. The pauses in Homer\u2019s verse are so frequent and various, that to name another poet, if pauses are a fault, more faulty than he, were, perhaps, impossible. It may even be questioned, if a single passage of ten lines flowing with uninterrupted smoothness could be singled out from all the thousands that he has left us.", " Thrice o\u2019er the trench Achilles sent his voice Sonorous, and confusion at the sound Thrice seized the Trojans, and their famed allies.280 Twelve in that moment of their noblest died By their own spears and chariots, and with joy The Grecians from beneath a hill of darts Dragging Patroclus, placed him on his bier. Around him throng\u2019d his fellow-warriors bold,285 All weeping, after whom Achilles went Fast-weeping also at the doleful sight Of his true friend on his funereal bed Extended, gash\u2019d with many a mortal wound, Whom he had sent into the fight with steeds290 And chariot, but received him thence no more. And now majestic Juno sent the sun, Unwearied minister of light, although Reluctant, down into the Ocean stream. [5] So the sun sank, and the Achaians ceased295 From the all-wasting labors of the war. On the other side, the Trojans, from the fight Retiring, loosed their steeds, but ere they took Thought of refreshment, in full council met. It was a council at which no man sat,300 Or dared; all stood; such terror had on all Fallen, for that Achilles had appear\u2019d, After long pause from battle\u2019s arduous toil.

Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell! What Trojan first, or what ally of Troy265 Opposed the force of Agamemnon\u2019s arm?

King of Pylus, an ancient city of Elis. [Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him.\u2014Tr.] [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege. [The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles.\u2014Tr.]", " With Gorgon looks, meantime, and eyes of Mars,400 Hector impetuous his mane-tossing steeds 197 From side to side before the rampart drove, When white-arm\u2019d Juno pitying the Greeks, In accents wing\u2019d her speech to Pallas turn\u2019d.

The hero and the Patriarch are substantially co\u00ebval; but the first wanders in twilight, the last stands in the eye of Heaven. When three men appeared to Abraham in the plains of Mamre, he ran to meet them from the tent door, brought them in, directed Sarah to make bread, fetched from the herd himself a calf tender and good, dressed it, and set it before them.

It is real and important; it affords a standard of the feelings with which we ought to read the Iliad, if we mean to read it as it deserves; and it explains and sets in the true point of view numberless passages, which the ignorance or frivolity of after-times has charged with obscurity, meanness or error.", " My mother! it is true; Olympian Jove That prayer fulfils; but thence, what joy to me,100 Patroclus slain? the friend of all my friends Whom most I loved, dear to me as my life\u2014 Him I have lost.

That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue. Why it was \u00c6g\u00e6on, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was called \u00c6g\u00e6on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub\u0153a, the seat of Poseidon \u00c6g\u00e6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller. Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an allegory.", " Homer magnifies the ambush as the boldest enterprise of war. They went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of sceptre. Ovid, in speaking of Jupiter, describes him as resting on his sceptre.\u2014Spence. From the description here given, it would appear to have been a young tree cut from the root and stripped of its branches. It was the custom of Kings to swear by their sceptres. For an account of the contest between the Centaurs and Lapiths here referred to, see Grecian and Roman Mythology. In _antiquity_, a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_, any sacrifice of a large number of victims. [The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids.", " Homer introduces it without reference to its meaning, which was undoubtedly some physical truth connected with the ether and the atmosphere.\u2014E.P.P. [The reader, in order that he may partake with the gods in the drollery of this scene, should observe that the crippled and distorted Vulcan had thrust himself into an office at all other times administered either by Hebe or Ganymede.\u2014Tr.] As Minerva or Wisdom was among the company, the poet\u2019s making Vulcan act the part of peace-maker, would appear to have been from choice, knowing that a mirthful person may often stop a quarrel, by making himself the subject of merriment. Footnotes for Book II: The poem now becomes more exciting; the language more animated; the descriptions more lively and figurative. Homer seems to kindle with his subject, and to press all the phenomena of nature into his service for the purpose of illustration and adornment. Jupiter prepares to keep his promise of avenging Achilles, by drawing Agamemnon into a deceitful expectation of taking the city. The forces are arranged for battle, which gives occasion for the celebrated catalogue.\u2014Felton. The whole action of the Dream is natural. It takes the figure of one much beloved by Agamemnon, as the object that is most in our thoughts when awake, is the one that oftenest appears to us in our dreams, and just at the instant of its vanishing, leaves so strong an impression, that the voice seems still sounding in his ear.", " He ended, and regaining, quick, his tent, Ulysses slung his shield, then coming forth175 Join\u2019d them.

The large round shield, sometimes made of osiers twisted together and covered with several ox-hides, and bound round the edge with metal. In the Homeric times it was supported by a belt; subsequently a band was placed across the inner side, in which the left arm was inserted, and a strong leather strap fastened near the edge at certain distances, which was grasped by the hand. The helmet, made of metal and lined with felt. Lastly the spear, and in many cases two. The heavy-armed soldiery were distinguished from the light. The covering of the latter consisted of skins, and instead of the sword and lance, they fought with darts, bows and arrows, or slings, and were generally attached in a subordinate capacity to the heavy-armed soldiery. Homer puts a prayer in the mouth of Menela\u00fcs, but none in that of Paris. Menela\u00fcs is injured and innocent, and may therefore ask for justice; but Paris, who is the criminal, remains silent.

When Minerva would persuade the Greeks, she seeks Ulysses; when she would break the truce, for Pandarus; and when she would conquer, for Diomede.

In like manner Diana and the river-god Scamander sometimes play a very undignified part. Apollo alone uniformly maintains his dignity.\u2014Muller. This is a very beautiful soliloquy of Agenor, such as would naturally arise in the soul of a brave man going upon a desperate enterprise. From the conclusion it is evident, that the story of Achilles being invulnerable except in the heel, is an invention of a later age. Footnotes for Book XXII: This simile is very striking. It not only describes the appearance of Achilles, but is peculiarly appropriate because the star was supposed to be of evil omen, and to bring with it disease and destruction.

So saying, the Goddess raised his courage high. Then, through the nostrils of the dead she pour\u2019d Ambrosia, and the ruddy juice divine45 Of nectar, antidotes against decay.

At once, the anodyne his pain assuaged, The wound was dried within, and the blood ceased. It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from the Gods forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their general at their head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon this hinge turns the whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of Patroclus, and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles. The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents."], "Which two characters are referred to as the \u201cAeantes\u201d?": [" In the following review of the army, we see the skill of an accomplished general as well as the characters of the leaders whom Agamemnon addresses. He begins with an address to the army in general, and then turns to individuals. To the brave he urges their secure hopes of conquest, since the gods must punish perjury; to the timid, their inevitable destruction if the enemy should burn their ships. After this he flies from rank to rank, skilfully addressing each ally, and presents a lively picture of a great mind in the highest emotion. The ancients usually in their feasts divided to the guests in equal portions, except they took particular occasion to show distinction. It was then considered the highest mark of honor to be allotted the best portion of meat and wine, and to be allowed an exemption from the laws of the feast in drinking wine unmingled and without measure. This custom was much more ancient than the time of the Trojan war, and we find it practised in the banquet given by Joseph to his brethren. [Diverse interpretations are given of this passage. I have adopted that which to me appeared most plausible.

Ezekiel describing a great lamentation, says, \u201cThey shall make themselves utterly bald for thee.\u201d ch. xxvii. 31. If it was the general custom of any country to wear long hair, then the cutting it off was a token of sorrow; but if the custom was to wear it short, then letting it grow, in neglect, was a sign of mourning. It was the custom of the ancients not only to offer their own hair to the river-gods of their country, but also the hair of their children. In Egypt hair was consecrated to the Nile.

He who prays either kills his enemy, or has signs given him that he has been heard.

Homer takes occasion from it, to open the scene with a beautiful allegory. He supposes that such afflictions are sent from Heaven for the punishment of evil actions; and because the sun was the principal agent, he says it was sent to punish Agamemnon for despising that god, and injuring his priest. Hippocrates observes two things of plagues; that their cause is in the air, and that different animals are differently affected by them, according to their nature and nourishment. This philosophy is referred to the plagues here mentioned. First, the cause is in the air by means of the darts or beams of Apollo; second, the mules and dogs are said to die sooner than the men, partly from their natural quickness of smell, and partly from their feeding so near the earth whence the exhalations arise.", " Homer magnifies the ambush as the boldest enterprise of war. They went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of sceptre. Ovid, in speaking of Jupiter, describes him as resting on his sceptre.\u2014Spence.

But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids."], "Who attempts to fight Achilles in one-on-one battle, allowing the Trojan army to flee inside to walls of Troy?": [" [39] Jove also, kindler of the fires of heaven, His couch ascending as at other times750 When gentle sleep approach\u2019d him, slept serene, With golden-sceptred Juno at his side. The first book contains the preliminaries to the commencement of serious action. First, the visit of the priest of Apollo to ransom his captive daughter, the refusal of Agamemnon to yield her up, and the pestilence sent by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence. Secondly, the restoration, the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles, and the withdrawing of the latter from the Grecian army. Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter. The poet, throughout this book, maintains a simple, unadorned style, but highly descriptive, and happily adapted to the nature of the subject.\u2014Felton. 029 THE ILIAD. BOOK II. 030 ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. Jupiter, in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Grecians in answer to the prayer of Thetis, deceives Agamemnon by a dream. He, in consequence of it, calls a council, the result of which is that the army shall go forth to battle. Thersites is mutinous, and is chastised by Ulysses. Ulysses, Nestor, and Agamemnon, harangue the people; and preparation is made for battle.", " Passing the prospect-mount where high in air The wild-fig waved,[6] they rush\u2019d along the road, Declining never from the wall of Troy.170 And now they reach\u2019d the running rivulets clear, Where from Scamander\u2019s dizzy flood arise Two fountains,[7] tepid one, from which a smoke Issues voluminous as from a fire, The other, even in summer heats, like hail175 For cold, or snow, or crystal-stream frost-bound. Beside them may be seen the broad canals Of marble scoop\u2019d, in which the wives of Troy And all her daughters fair were wont to lave Their costly raiment,[8] while the land had rest,180 And ere the warlike sons of Greece arrived. By these they ran, one fleeing, one in chase. Valiant was he who fled, but valiant far Beyond him he who urged the swift pursuit; Nor ran they for a vulgar prize, a beast185 For sacrifice, or for the hide of such, The swift foot-racer\u2019s customary meed, 541 But for the noble Hector\u2019s life they ran.

King of Pylus, an ancient city of Elis. [Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him.\u2014Tr.] [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death.

The Libyans carried no other arms than the spear and a bag of stones. The Trojans were required to sacrifice two lambs; one male of a white color to the Sun, as the father of light, and one female and black to the Earth, the mother and nurse of men. That these were the powers to which they sacrificed appears from their being attested by name in the oath. III. 330. Helen\u2019s weaving the events of the Trojan war in a veil is an agreeable fiction; and one might suppose that it was inherited by Homer, and explained in his Iliad.\u2014Dacier.

The effect of Helen\u2019s appearance upon the aged counsellors is striking and poetical. It must be borne in mind, that Helen was of divine parentage and unfading beauty, and this will explain the enthusiasm which her sight called forth from the old men. The poet\u2019s skill in taking this method of describing the Grecian chieftains is obvious, and the sketches themselves are living and characteristic to a high degree. The reminiscences of the aged Priam, as their names are announced, and the penitential sorrow of the erring Helen, which the sight of her countrymen, and the recollection of her home, her child, her companions, excite in her bosom, are among the most skilful touches of natural feeling.\u2014Felton.", " 079 That prize the Hero, whirling it aloft, Threw to his Greeks, who caught it and secured, Then with vindictive strides he rush\u2019d again450 On Paris, spear in hand; but him involved In mist opaque Venus with ease divine Snatch\u2019d thence, and in his chamber placed him, fill\u2019d With scents odorous, spirit-soothing sweets.

The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods.

The first book contains the preliminaries to the commencement of serious action. First, the visit of the priest of Apollo to ransom his captive daughter, the refusal of Agamemnon to yield her up, and the pestilence sent by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence. Secondly, the restoration, the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles, and the withdrawing of the latter from the Grecian army. Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter.

If it be easier, therefore, to throw five balls into the air and to catch them in succession, than to sport in that manner with one only, then may blank verse be more easily fabricated than rhyme. And if to these labors we add others equally requisite, a style in general more elaborate than rhyme requires, farther removed from the vernacular idiom both in the language xi itself and in the arrangement of it, we shall not long doubt which of these two very different species of verse threatens the composer with most expense of study and contrivance. I feel it unpleasant to appeal to my own experience, but, having no other voucher at hand, am constrained to it. As I affirm, so I have found. I have dealt pretty largely in both kinds, and have frequently written more verses in a day, with tags, than I could ever write without them.

It required some address in Diomede to make a choice without offending the Grecian princes, each one of whom might consider it an indignity to be refused such a place of honor. Diomede, therefore, chose Ulysses, not for his valor, but for his wisdom. On this point, the other leaders all yielded to him. The heroes are well armed for their design. Ulysses has a bow and arrows, that he may be able to wound the enemy at a distance, and Diomede a two-edged sword.

This is a striking simile, from its exactness in two points\u2014the noise and the order. It has been supposed that the embattling of an army was first learned by observing the close order of the flight of these birds. The noise of the Trojans contrasts strongly with the silence of the Greeks. Plutarch remarks upon this distinction as a credit to the military discipline of the latter, and Homer would seem to have attached some importance to it, as he again alludes to the same thing.

[The name signifies, the _Chief of the city_.\u2014Tr.] It was the custom to plant about tombs only such trees as elms, alders, etc., that bear no fruit, as being most appropriate to the dead. In this recapitulation, Homer acquaints us with some of the great achievements of Achilles, which preceded the opening of the poem\u2014a happy manner of exalting his hero, and exciting our expectation as to what he is yet to accomplish. His greatest enemies never upbraid him, but confess his glory. When Apollo encourages the Trojans to fight, it is by telling them Achilles fights no more. When Juno animates the Greeks, she reminds them how their enemies fear Achilles; and when Andromache trembles for Hector, it is with the remembrance of his resistless force. Drawing water was considered the most servile employment. [The Scholiast in Villoisson calls it \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1 a natural and moderate laughter.\u2014Tr.] According to the ancient belief, the fatal period of life is appointed to all men at the time of their birth, which no precaution can avoid and no danger hasten.", " She ended, to whom Paris thus replied. Ah Helen, wound me not with taunt severe!515 Me, Menela\u00fcs, by Minerva\u2019s aid, Hath vanquish\u2019d now, who may hereafter, him. We also have our Gods. But let us love. For never since the day when thee I bore From pleasant Laced\u00e6mon o\u2019er the waves520 To Cran\u00e4e\u2019s fair isle, and first enjoy\u2019d Thy beauty, loved I as I love thee now, Or felt such sweetness of intense desire. 081 He spake, and sought his bed, whom follow\u2019d soon Jove\u2019s daughter, reconciled to his embrace.525 But Menela\u00fcs like a lion ranged The multitude, inquiring far and near For Paris lost. Yet neither Trojan him Nor friend of Troy could show, whom, else, through love None had conceal\u2019d, for him as death itself530 All hated, but his going none had seen. Amidst them all then spake the King of men. Trojans, and Dardans, and allies of Troy! The warlike Menela\u00fcs hath prevailed, As is most plain. Now therefore bring ye forth535 Helen with all her treasures, also bring Such large amercement as is meet, a sum To be remember\u2019d in all future times. So spake Atrides, and Achaia\u2019s host With loud applause confirm\u2019d the monarch\u2019s claim.540 083 THE ILIAD. BOOK IV. 084 ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK. In a Council of the Gods, a dispute arises between Jupiter and Juno, which is at last compromised, Jove consenting to dispatch Minerva with a charge to incite some Trojan to a violation of the truce. Minerva descends for that purpose, and in the form of Laodocus, a son of Priam, exhorts Pandarus to shoot at Menelaus, and succeeds."], "How does Agamemnon avoid taking responsibility for his bad decisions?": [" But if the relations of the murdered person were willing, the criminal, by paying a certain fine, might buy off the exile and remain at home. Ajax sums up this argument with great strength: We see, says he, a brother forgive the murder of his brother, a father that of his son; but Achilles will not forgive the injury offered him by taking away one captive woman. The character of Achilles is well sustained in all his speeches. To Ulysses he returns a flat denial, and threatens to leave the Trojan shore in the morning. To Ph\u0153nix his answer is more gentle. After Ajax has spoken, he seems determined not to depart, but yet refuses to bear arms, except in defence of his own squadron. Footnotes for Book X: With slight alteration, Homer here repeats the verses that open the 2d Book, and ascribes to Agamemnon the same watchfulness over men that Jupiter had over the gods. Menelaus starts a design, which is afterwards proposed by Nestor in council. The poet knew that the project would come with greater weight from the age of the one than from the youth of the other, and that the valiant would be ready to engage in the enterprise suggested by so venerable a counsellor. Agamemnon is uniformly represented as an example of brotherly affection, and at all times defends Menelaus. [\u03a3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u2014seems to have been a hollow iron with a point, fitted to the obtuse end of the spear, for the purpose of planting that end of it in the ground.", " Homer introduces it without reference to its meaning, which was undoubtedly some physical truth connected with the ether and the atmosphere.\u2014E.P.P. [The reader, in order that he may partake with the gods in the drollery of this scene, should observe that the crippled and distorted Vulcan had thrust himself into an office at all other times administered either by Hebe or Ganymede.\u2014Tr.] As Minerva or Wisdom was among the company, the poet\u2019s making Vulcan act the part of peace-maker, would appear to have been from choice, knowing that a mirthful person may often stop a quarrel, by making himself the subject of merriment. Footnotes for Book II: The poem now becomes more exciting; the language more animated; the descriptions more lively and figurative. Homer seems to kindle with his subject, and to press all the phenomena of nature into his service for the purpose of illustration and adornment. Jupiter prepares to keep his promise of avenging Achilles, by drawing Agamemnon into a deceitful expectation of taking the city. The forces are arranged for battle, which gives occasion for the celebrated catalogue.\u2014Felton. The whole action of the Dream is natural. It takes the figure of one much beloved by Agamemnon, as the object that is most in our thoughts when awake, is the one that oftenest appears to us in our dreams, and just at the instant of its vanishing, leaves so strong an impression, that the voice seems still sounding in his ear.", " So vow\u2019d the hoary Chief, whose wishes thou Leavest unperform\u2019d. Since, therefore, never more I see my native home, the hero these190 Patroclus takes down with him to the shades. He said, and filling with his hair the hand Of his dead friend, the sorrows of his train Waken\u2019d afresh. And now the lamp of day Westering[6] apace, had left them still in tears,195 Had not Achilles suddenly address\u2019d King Agamemnon, standing at his side. Atrides! (for Achaia\u2019s sons thy word Will readiest execute) we may with grief Satiate ourselves hereafter; but, the host200 561 Dispersing from the pile, now give command That they prepare repast; ourselves,[7] to whom These labors in peculiar appertain Will finish them; but bid the Chiefs abide. Which when imperial Agamemnon heard,205 He scatter\u2019d instant to their several ships The people; but the burial-dressers thence Went not; they, still abiding, heap\u2019d the pile. A hundred feet of breadth from side to side They gave to it, and on the summit placed210 With sorrowing hearts the body of the dead. Many a fat sheep, with many an ox full-horn\u2019d They flay\u2019d before the pile, busy their task Administering, and Peleus\u2019 son the fat Taking from every victim, overspread215 Complete the body with it of his friend[8] Patroclus, and the flay\u2019d beasts heap\u2019d around. Then, placing flagons on the pile, replete With oil and honey, he inclined their mouths Toward the bier, and slew and added next,220 Deep-groaning and in haste, four martial steeds.", " The Dream also repeats the words of Jupiter without variation, which is considered as a great propriety in delivering a message from the father of gods and men. King of Pylus, an ancient city of Elis. [Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him.\u2014Tr.] [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege. [The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles.\u2014Tr.]"], "How do others respond to Paris spending time with Helen rather than fighting?": [" 079 That prize the Hero, whirling it aloft, Threw to his Greeks, who caught it and secured, Then with vindictive strides he rush\u2019d again450 On Paris, spear in hand; but him involved In mist opaque Venus with ease divine Snatch\u2019d thence, and in his chamber placed him, fill\u2019d With scents odorous, spirit-soothing sweets. Nor stay\u2019d the Goddess, but at once in quest455 Of Helen went; her on a lofty tower She found, where many a damsel stood of Troy, And twitch\u2019d her fragrant robe. In form she seem\u2019d An ancient matron, who, while Helen dwelt In Laced\u00e6mon, her unsullied wool460 Dress\u2019d for her, faithfullest of all her train. Like her disguised the Goddess thus began. Haste\u2014Paris calls thee\u2014on his sculptured couch, (Sparkling alike his looks and his attire) He waits thy wish\u2019d return. Thou wouldst not dream465 That he had fought; he rather seems prepared For dance, or after dance, for soft repose. So saying, she tumult raised in Helen\u2019s mind. Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck, By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes470 She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake. Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish Now to ensnare me? Wouldst thou lure me, say, To some fair city of M\u00e6onian name Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still?475 Hast thou some human favorite also there? Is it because Atrides hath prevailed To vanquish Paris, and would bear me home Unworthy as I am, that thou attempt\u2019st Again to cheat me?", " I, the while, Seek Paris, and if Paris yet can hear, Shall call him forth. But oh that earth would yawn And swallow him, whom Jove hath made a curse345 To Troy, to Priam, and to all his house; Methinks, to see him plunged into the shades For ever, were a cure for all my woes. He ceased; the Queen, her palace entering, charged Her maidens; they, incontinent, throughout350 All Troy convened the matrons, as she bade. Meantime into her wardrobe incense-fumed, Herself descended; there her treasures lay, Works of Sidonian women,[21] whom her son The godlike Paris, when he cross\u2019d the seas355 With Jove-begotten Helen, brought to Troy. The most magnificent, and varied most With colors radiant, from the rest she chose For Pallas; vivid as a star it shone, And lowest lay of all. Then forth she went,360 The Trojan matrons all following her steps. But when the long procession reach\u2019d the fane Of Pallas in the heights of Troy, to them The fair Theano ope\u2019d the portals wide, Daughter of Cisseus, brave Antenor\u2019s spouse,365 153 And by appointment public, at that time, Priestess of Pallas. All with lifted hands[22] In presence of Minerva wept aloud. Beauteous Theano on the Goddess\u2019 lap Then spread the robe, and to the daughter fair370 Of Jove omnipotent her suit address\u2019d. Goddess[23] of Goddesses, our city\u2019s shield, Adored Minerva, hear! oh! break the lance Of Diomede, and give himself to fall Prone in the dust before the Sc\u00e6an gate.375 So will we offer to thee at thy shrine, This day twelve heifers of the year, untouch\u2019d By yoke or goad, if thou wilt pity show To Troy, and save our children and our wives.", " And last, without those towers and at their foot, Dig we a trench, which compassing around405 Our camp, both steeds and warriors shall exclude, And all fierce inroad of the haughty foe. So counsell\u2019d he, whom every Chief approved. 177 In Troy meantime, at Priam\u2019s gate beside The lofty citadel, debate began410 The assembled senators between, confused, Clamorous, and with furious heat pursued, When them Antenor, prudent, thus bespake. Ye Trojans, Dardans, and allies of Troy, My counsel hear! Delay not. Instant yield415 To the Atrid\u00e6, hence to be convey\u2019d, Helen of Greece with all that is her own. For charged with violated oaths we fight, And hope I none conceive that aught by us Design\u2019d shall prosper, unless so be done.420 He spake and sat; when from his seat arose Paris, fair Helen\u2019s noble paramour, Who thus with speech impassion\u2019d quick replied. Antenor! me thy counsel hath not pleased; Thou could\u2019st have framed far better; but if this425 Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth. But I will speak myself. Ye Chiefs of Troy, I tell you plain. I will not yield my spouse. But all her treasures to our house convey\u2019d430 From Argos, those will I resign, and add Still other compensation from my own. Thus Paris said and sat; when like the Gods Themselves in wisdom, from his seat uprose Dardanian Priam, who them thus address\u2019d.435 Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy!", " He spake, and Priam, shuddering, bade his train310 Prepare his steeds; they sedulous obey\u2019d. First, Priam mounting, backward stretch\u2019d the reins; Antenor, next, beside him sat, and through The Sc\u00e6an gate they drove into the plain. Arriving at the hosts of Greece and Troy315 They left the chariot, and proceeded both Into the interval between the hosts. 075 Then uprose Agamemnon, and uprose All-wise Ulysses. Next, the heralds came Conspicuous forward, expediting each320 The ceremonial; they the beaker fill\u2019d With wine, and to the hands of all the kings Minister\u2019d water. Agamemnon then Drawing his dagger which he ever bore Appendant to his heavy falchion\u2019s sheath,325 Cut off the forelocks of the lambs,[15] of which The heralds gave to every Grecian Chief A portion, and to all the Chiefs of Troy. Then Agamemnon raised his hands, and pray\u2019d. Jove, Father, who from Ida stretchest forth330 Thine arm omnipotent, o\u2019erruling all, And thou, all-seeing and all-hearing Sun, Ye Rivers, and thou conscious Earth, and ye Who under earth on human kind avenge Severe, the guilt of violated oaths,335 Hear ye, and ratify what now we swear!

As the poet did not intend to draw the character of a perfect man in Achilles, he makes him delighted with the destruction of the Greeks, because it gratified his revenge. That resentment which is the subject of the poem, still presides over every other feeling, even the love of his country. He begins now to pity his countrymen, yet he seems gratified by their distress, because it will contribute to his glory. This onion was very different from the root which now passes under that name.

Whether a translation of Homer may be best executed in blank verse or in rhyme, is a question in the decision of which no man can find difficulty, who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be, or who is in any degree practically acquainted with those very different kinds of versification. I will venture to assert that a just translation of any ancient poet in rhyme, is impossible. No human ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing every couplet with sounds homotonous, expressing at the same time the full sense, and only the full sense of his original."], "How is death portrayed in The Iliad?": [" [3] Such was my wrath which Agamemnon roused, The king of men. But since the past is fled140 Irrevocable, howsoe\u2019er distress\u2019d, Renounce we now vain musings on the past, Content through sad necessity. I go In quest of noble Hector, who hath slain My loved Patroclus, and such death will take145 As Jove ordains me and the Powers of Heaven At their own season, send it when they may. For neither might the force of Hercules, Although high-favored of Saturnian Jove, From death escape, but Fate and the revenge150 Restless of Juno vanquish\u2019d even Him. I also, if a destiny like his Await me, shall, like him, find rest in death; But glory calls me now; now will I make Some Trojan wife or Dardan with both hands155 Wipe her soft cheeks, and utter many a groan. Long time have I been absent from the field, And they shall know it. Love me as thou may\u2019st, Yet thwart me not, for I am fixt to go. Whom Thetis answer\u2019d, Goddess of the Deep.160 Thou hast well said, my son! it is no blame To save from threaten\u2019d death our suffering friends.

May not the son of Thetis azure-hair\u2019d, Achilles, perish first by spear of mine?

She found her son All tears, and close enfolding in his arms5 Patroclus, while his Myrmidons around Wept also;[1] she amid them, graceful, stood, And seizing fast his hand, him thus bespake.

In him fresh vengeance kindled at the view, And, while he gazed, a splendor as of fire Flash\u2019d from his eyes. Delighted, in his hand20 He held the glorious bounty of the God, And, wondering at those strokes of art divine, 476 His eager speech thus to his mother turn\u2019d.

Grecian heroes! ministers of Mars! Be men, my friends! now summon all your might!

How shall I seek the fight? they have my arms. My mother charged me also to abstain From battle, till she bring me armor new Which she hath promised me from Vulcan\u2019s hand.235 Meantime, whose armor else might serve my need 458 I know not, save perhaps alone the shield Of Telamonian Ajax, whom I deem Himself now busied in the stormy van, Slaying the Trojans in my friend\u2019s defence.240 To whom the swift-wing\u2019d messenger of heaven, Full well we know thine armor Hector\u2019s prize Yet, issuing to the margin of the foss, Show thyself only.", " They as a cloud of starlings or of daws Fly screaming shrill, warn\u2019d timely of the kite Or hawk, devourers of the smaller kinds,915 So they shrill-clamoring toward the fleet, Hasted before \u00c6neas and the might Of Hector, nor the battle heeded more.

Achilles, by command of Juno, shows himself to the Trojans, who fly at his appearance; Vulcan, at the insistence of Thetis, forges for him a suit of armor. 451 BOOK XVIII. Thus burn\u2019d the battle like devouring fire. Meantime, Antilochus with rapid steps Came to Achilles. Him he found before His lofty barks, occupied, as he stood, With boding fears of all that had befall\u2019n.5 He groan\u2019d, and to his noble self he said. Ah! wo is me\u2014why falls Achaia\u2019s host, With such disorder foul, back on the fleet? I tremble lest the Gods my anxious thoughts Accomplish and my mother\u2019s words, who erst10 Hath warn\u2019d me, that the bravest and the best Of all my Myrmidons, while yet I live, Slain under Troy, must view the sun no more. Brave Men\u0153tiades is, doubtless, slain. Unhappy friend! I bade thee oft, our barks15 Deliver\u2019d once from hostile fires, not seek To cope in arms with Hector, but return. While musing thus he stood, the son approach\u2019d Of noble Nestor, and with tears his cheeks Bedewing copious, his sad message told.20 Oh son of warlike Peleus!"], "What does The Iliad suggest about burial?": [" But now, Astyanax (so named in Troy For thy sake, guardian of her gates and towers) His father lost, must many a pang endure.590 And as for thee, cast naked forth among Yon galleys, where no parent\u2019s eye of thine Shall find thee, when the dogs have torn thee once Till they are sated, worms shall eat thee next. Meantime, thy graceful raiment rich, prepared595 By our own maidens, in thy palace lies; But I will burn it, burn it all, because Useless to thee, who never, so adorn\u2019d, Shalt slumber more; yet every eye in Troy Shall see, how glorious once was thy attire. [18]600 So, weeping, she; to whom the multitude Of Trojan dames responsive sigh\u2019d around. 553 THE ILIAD. BOOK XXIII. 554 ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-THIRD BOOK. The body of Patroclus is burned, and the funeral games ensue. 555 BOOK XXIII. Such mourning was in Troy; meantime the Greeks Their galleys and the shores of Hellespont Regaining, each to his own ship retired. But not the Myrmidons; Achilles them Close rank\u2019d in martial order still detain\u2019d,5 And thus his fellow-warriors brave address\u2019d. Ye swift-horsed Myrmidons, associates dear! Release not from your chariots yet your steeds Firm-hoof\u2019d, but steeds and chariots driving near, Bewail Patroclus, as the rites demand10 Of burial; then, satiate with grief and tears, We will release our steeds, and take repast. He ended, and, himself leading the way, His numerous band all mourn\u2019d at once the dead.", " From the fact that so few mystical myths are introduced in the Iliad, M\u00fcller infers that the mystical element of religion could not have predominated among the Grecian people for whom Homer sang. Otherwise, his poems in which that element is but little regarded, would not have afforded universal pleasure and satisfaction. He therefore takes but a passing notice of Demeter. M\u00fcller also remarks, that in this we cannot but admire the artistic skill of Homer, and the feeling for what is right and fitting that was innate with the Greeks. [Vide Samson to Harapha in the Agonistes. There the word is used in the same sense.\u2014Tr.] [This is a construction of \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9 given by some of the best commentators, and that seems the most probable.\u2014Tr.] This slow and orderly retreat of the Greeks, with their front constantly turned to the enemy, is a fine encomium on their courage and discipline. This manner of retreating was customary among the Laced\u00e6monians, as were many other martial customs described by Homer. The practice arose from the apprehension of being killed by a wound in the back, which was not only punished with infamy, but a person bearing the mark was denied the rites of burial. [This, according to Porphyrius as quoted by Clarke, is the true meaning of \u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2.\u2014Tr.] The chariots of the gods were formed of various metals, and drawn through the air, or upon the surface of the sea, by horses of celestial breed.", " Where now are all your promises and vows,410 Councils, libations, right-hand covenants? [14] Burn them, since all our occupation here Is to debate and wrangle, whereof end Or fruit though long we wait, shall none be found. But, Sovereign, be not thou appall\u2019d. Be firm.415 Relax not aught of thine accustomed sway, But set the battle forth as thou art wont. And if there be a Grecian, here and there, One,[15] adverse to the general voice, let such Wither alone. He shall not see his wish420 Gratified, neither will we hence return To Argos, ere events shall yet have proved Jove\u2019s promise false or true. For when we climb\u2019d Our gallant barks full-charged with Ilium\u2019s fate, Saturnian Jove omnipotent, that day,425 (Omen propitious!) thunder\u2019d on the right. Let no man therefore pant for home, till each Possess a Trojan spouse, and from her lips 044 Take sweet revenge for Helen\u2019s pangs of heart. Who then? What soldier languishes and sighs430 To leave us? Let him dare to lay his hand On his own vessel, and he dies the first. But hear, O King! I shall suggest a course Not trivial. Agamemnon! sort the Greeks By districts and by tribes, that tribe may tribe435 Support, and each his fellow. This performed, And with consent of all, thou shalt discern With ease what Chief, what private man deserts, And who performs his part. The base, the brave, Such disposition made, shall both appear;440 And thou shalt also know, if heaven or we, The Gods, or our supineness, succor Troy.", " An observation that should suggest itself to us with no little force, when Achilles, not remarkable either for patience or meekness, exhorts Priam to beware of provoking him; and when having cleansed the body of Hector and covered it, he places it himself in the litter, lest his father, seeing how indecently he had treated it, should be exasperated at the sight, and by some passionate reproach exasperate himself also. For that a person so singularly irascible and of a temper harsh as his, should not only be aware of his infirmity, but even guard against it with so much precaution, evidences a prudence truly wonderful.\u2014Plutarch.]\u2014Tr.

Clarke renders the word in this place, _falso met\u00fb, ludens,_ and Eustathius says that Achilles suggested such cause of fear to Priam, to excuse his lodging him in an exterior part of the tent. The general import of the Greek word is sarcastic, but here it signifies rather\u2014to intimidate. See also Dacier.]\u2014Tr. The poet here shows the importance of Achilles in the army. Agamemnon is the general, yet all the chief commanders appeal to him for advice, and on his own authority he promises Priam a cessation of arms. Giving his hand to confirm the promise, agrees with the custom of the present day. This lament of Andromache may be compared to her pathetic address to Hector in the scene at the Sc\u00e6an gate. It forms indeed, a most beautiful and eloquent pendant to that.\u2014Felton."], "What does Chryses want Agamemnon to do?": [" So saying, he gave her to him, who with joy Received his daughter. Then, before the shrine550 Magnificent in order due they ranged The noble Hecatomb. [31] Each laved his hands And took the salted meal, and Chryses made His fervent prayer with hands upraised on high. God of the silver bow, who with thy power555 Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign\u2019st supreme In Tenedos, and Cilla the divine! Thou prov\u2019dst propitious to my first request, Hast honor\u2019d me, and punish\u2019d sore the Greeks; Hear yet thy servant\u2019s prayer; take from their host560 At once the loathsome pestilence away! So Chryses prayed, whom Ph\u0153bus heard well-pleased; Then prayed the Grecians also, and with meal Sprinkling the victims, their retracted necks First pierced, then flay\u2019d them; the disjointed thighs565 They, next, invested with the double caul, Which with crude slices thin they overspread. The priest burned incense, and libation poured Large on the hissing brands, while, him beside, Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth570 Trained to the task. The thighs with fire consumed, They gave to each his portion of the maw, Then slashed the remnant, pierced it with the spits, And managing with culinary skill The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.575 Their whole task thus accomplish\u2019d, and the board 023 Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed. When neither hunger more nor thirst remained Unsatisfied, boys crown\u2019d the beakers high With wine delicious, and from right to left580 Distributing the cups, served every guest.", " From the gray flood Ascending sudden, like a mist she came, Sat down before him, stroked his face, and said.450 Why weeps my son? and what is thy distress?

She pleads it, and prevails. The book concludes with an account of what passed in Heaven on that occasion.

To the fleet he came15 Bearing rich ransom glorious to redeem His daughter, and his hands charged with the wreath And golden sceptre[2] of the God shaft-arm\u2019d. His supplication was at large to all The host of Greece, but most of all to two,20 The sons of Atreus, highest in command. Ye gallant Chiefs, and ye their gallant host, (So may the Gods who in Olympus dwell Give Priam\u2019s treasures to you for a spoil And ye return in safety,) take my gifts25 And loose my child, in honor of the son Of Jove, Apollo, archer of the skies.", " But short and sorrowful the fates ordain515 Thy life, peculiar trouble must be thine, Whom, therefore, oh that I had never borne! But seeking the Olympian hill snow-crown\u2019d, I will myself plead for thee in the ear Of Jove, the Thunderer. Meantime at thy fleet520 Abiding, let thy wrath against the Greeks Still burn, and altogether cease from war. For to the banks of the Oceanus,[28] Where \u00c6thiopia holds a feast to Jove,[29] 021 He journey\u2019d yesterday, with whom the Gods525 Went also, and the twelfth day brings them home.

So saying, she went; but him she left enraged530 For fair Bris\u00ebis\u2019 sake, forced from his arms By stress of power. Meantime Ulysses came To Chrysa with the Hecatomb in charge. Arrived within the haven[30] deep, their sails Furling, they stowed them in the bark below.535 Then by its tackle lowering swift the mast Into its crutch, they briskly push\u2019d to land, Heaved anchors out, and moor\u2019d the vessel fast. Forth came the mariners, and trod the beach; Forth came the victims of Apollo next,540 And, last, Chrys\u00ebis.

Agamemnon, King of men, Hath sent thy daughter home, with whom we bring545 A Hecatomb on all our host\u2019s behalf To Ph\u0153bus, hoping to appease the God 022 By whose dread shafts the Argives now expire."], "How does Apollo react to Chryses\u2019 prayers for help?": [" Throughout the Iliad, he appears and acts with splendor and effect, but always against the Greeks from mere partiality to Hector. It would perhaps be too much to say, that in this partiality to Hector, we detect the spirit of the Dorian worship, the only Paganism of antiquity that tended to perfect the individual\u2014Apollo being the expression of the moral harmony of the universe, and the great spirit of the Dorian culture being to make a perfect man, an incarnation of the \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2. This Homer could only have known intuitively. In making Apollo author of the plague, he was confounded with Helios, which was frequent afterwards, but is not seen elsewhere in Homer. The arrows of Apollo were \u201csilent as light,\u201d and their emblem the sun\u2019s rays. The analogies are multitudinous between the natural and intellectual sun; but Helios and Apollo were two.\u2014E.P.P. There is something exceedingly venerable in this appearance of the priest. He comes with the ensigns of the gods to whom he belongs, with the laurel wreath, to show that he was a suppliant, and a golden sceptre, which the ancients gave in particular to Apollo, as they did one of silver to Diana. The art of this speech is remarkable. Chryses considers the army of Greeks, as made up of troops, partly from the kingdoms and partly from democracies, and therefore begins with a distinction that includes all. Then, as priest of Apollo, he prays that they may obtain the two blessings they most desire\u2014the conquest of Troy and a safe return.", " Thee from my soul, thou semblance of the Gods, I loved, and all illustrious as thou art,600 Achilles! such I made thee. For with me, Me only, would\u2019st thou forth to feast abroad, Nor would\u2019st thou taste thy food at home, till first I placed thee on my knees, with my own hand Thy viands carved and fed thee, and the wine605 Held to thy lips; and many a time, in fits Of infant frowardness, the purple juice Rejecting thou hast deluged all my vest, And fill\u2019d my bosom. Oh, I have endured Much, and have also much perform\u2019d for thee,610 Thus purposing, that since the Gods vouchsaf\u2019d No son to me, thyself shouldst be my son, Godlike Achilles! who shouldst screen perchance From a foul fate my else unshelter\u2019d age. Achilles! bid thy mighty spirit down.615 Thou shouldst not be thus merciless; the Gods, Although more honorable, and in power And virtue thy superiors, are themselves Yet placable; and if a mortal man Offend them by transgression of their laws,620 Libation, incense, sacrifice, and prayer, In meekness offer\u2019d turn their wrath away. Prayers are Jove\u2019s daughters,[15] wrinkled,[16] lame, slant-eyed, Which though far distant, yet with constant pace Follow Offence. Offence, robust of limb,625 226 And treading firm the ground, outstrips them all, And over all the earth before them runs Hurtful to man. They, following, heal the hurt. Received respectfully when they approach, They help us, and our prayers hear in return.630 But if we slight, and with obdurate heart Resist them, to Saturnian Jove they cry Against us, supplicating that Offence May cleave to us for vengeance of the wrong.", " From the gray flood Ascending sudden, like a mist she came, Sat down before him, stroked his face, and said.450 Why weeps my son? and what is thy distress?

[Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him.\u2014Tr.] [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege. [The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles.\u2014Tr.]", " [39] Jove also, kindler of the fires of heaven, His couch ascending as at other times750 When gentle sleep approach\u2019d him, slept serene, With golden-sceptred Juno at his side.

First, the visit of the priest of Apollo to ransom his captive daughter, the refusal of Agamemnon to yield her up, and the pestilence sent by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence. Secondly, the restoration, the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles, and the withdrawing of the latter from the Grecian army. Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter. The poet, throughout this book, maintains a simple, unadorned style, but highly descriptive, and happily adapted to the nature of the subject.\u2014Felton. 029 THE ILIAD. BOOK II. 030 ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. Jupiter, in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Grecians in answer to the prayer of Thetis, deceives Agamemnon by a dream. He, in consequence of it, calls a council, the result of which is that the army shall go forth to battle. Thersites is mutinous, and is chastised by Ulysses.

Beside them may be seen the broad canals Of marble scoop\u2019d, in which the wives of Troy And all her daughters fair were wont to lave Their costly raiment,[8] while the land had rest,180 And ere the warlike sons of Greece arrived.

King of Pylus, an ancient city of Elis. [Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him.\u2014Tr.] [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege. [The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles.\u2014Tr.]", " [39] Jove also, kindler of the fires of heaven, His couch ascending as at other times750 When gentle sleep approach\u2019d him, slept serene, With golden-sceptred Juno at his side. The first book contains the preliminaries to the commencement of serious action. First, the visit of the priest of Apollo to ransom his captive daughter, the refusal of Agamemnon to yield her up, and the pestilence sent by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence. Secondly, the restoration, the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles, and the withdrawing of the latter from the Grecian army. Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter. The poet, throughout this book, maintains a simple, unadorned style, but highly descriptive, and happily adapted to the nature of the subject.\u2014Felton. 029 THE ILIAD. BOOK II. 030 ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. Jupiter, in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Grecians in answer to the prayer of Thetis, deceives Agamemnon by a dream. He, in consequence of it, calls a council, the result of which is that the army shall go forth to battle. Thersites is mutinous, and is chastised by Ulysses. Ulysses, Nestor, and Agamemnon, harangue the people; and preparation is made for battle.", " But waste the town he shall not, nor attempt345 461 With all the utmost valor that he boasts To force a pass; dogs shall devour him first. To whom brave Hector louring, and in wrath. Polydamas, I like not thy advice Who bidd\u2019st us in our city skulk, again350 Imprison\u2019d there. Are ye not yet content? Wish ye for durance still in your own towers? Time was, when in all regions under heaven Men praised the wealth of Priam\u2019s city stored With gold and brass; but all our houses now355 Stand emptied of their hidden treasures rare. Jove in his wrath hath scatter\u2019d them; our wealth Is marketed, and Phrygia hath a part Purchased, and part M\u00e6onia\u2019s lovely land. But since the son of wily Saturn old360 Hath given me glory now, and to inclose The Grecians in their fleet hemm\u2019d by the sea, Fool! taint not with such talk the public mind. For not a Trojan here will thy advice Follow, or shall; it hath not my consent.365 But thus I counsel. Let us, band by band, Throughout the host take supper, and let each, Guarded against nocturnal danger, watch. And if a Trojan here be rack\u2019d in mind Lest his possessions perish, let him cast370 His golden heaps into the public maw,[6] Far better so consumed than by the Greeks. Then, with the morrow\u2019s dawn, all fair array\u2019d In battle, we will give them at their fleet Sharp onset, and if Peleus\u2019 noble son375 Have risen indeed to conflict for the ships, The worse for him.", " In the following review of the army, we see the skill of an accomplished general as well as the characters of the leaders whom Agamemnon addresses. He begins with an address to the army in general, and then turns to individuals. To the brave he urges their secure hopes of conquest, since the gods must punish perjury; to the timid, their inevitable destruction if the enemy should burn their ships. After this he flies from rank to rank, skilfully addressing each ally, and presents a lively picture of a great mind in the highest emotion. The ancients usually in their feasts divided to the guests in equal portions, except they took particular occasion to show distinction. It was then considered the highest mark of honor to be allotted the best portion of meat and wine, and to be allowed an exemption from the laws of the feast in drinking wine unmingled and without measure. This custom was much more ancient than the time of the Trojan war, and we find it practised in the banquet given by Joseph to his brethren. [Diverse interpretations are given of this passage. I have adopted that which to me appeared most plausible. It seems to be a caution against the mischiefs that might ensue, should the horses be put under the management of a driver with whom they were unacquainted.\u2014The scholium by Villoisson much countenances this solution.\u2014Tr.] [Here Nestor only mentions the name of Ereuthalion, knowing the present to be an improper time for story-telling; in the seventh book he relates his fight and victory at length."], "What qualities are Achilles and Ajax heralded for?": [" Then, shall they rue thy counsel, King of men!120 To whom the imperial leader of the Greeks. Thy sharp reproof, Ulysses, hath my soul Pierced deeply. Yet I gave no such command That the Achaians should their galleys launch, Would they, or would they not. No. I desire125 That young or old, some other may advice More prudent give, and he shall please me well. Then thus the gallant Diomede replied. That man is near, and may ye but be found Tractable, our inquiry shall be short.130 Be patient each, nor chide me nor reproach Because I am of greener years than ye, For I am sprung from an illustrious Sire, From Tydeus, who beneath his hill of earth Lies now entomb\u2019d at Thebes. Three noble sons135 Were born to Portheus, who in Pleuro dwelt, 345 And on the heights of Calydon; the first Agrius; the second Melas; and the third Brave Oeneus, father of my father, famed For virtuous qualities above the rest.140 Oeneus still dwelt at home; but wandering thence My father dwelt in Argos; so the will Of Jove appointed, and of all the Gods. There he espoused the daughter of the King Adrastus, occupied a mansion rich145 In all abundance; many a field possess\u2019d Of wheat, well-planted gardens, numerous flocks, And was expert in spearmanship esteem\u2019d Past all the Grecians.

My gallant Ajax, haste\u2014come quickly\u2014strive145 With me to rescue for Achilles\u2019 sake His friend, though bare, for Hector hath his arms. He said, and by his words the noble mind Of Ajax roused; issuing through the van He went, and Menelaus at his side.150 Hector the body of Patroclus dragg\u2019d, Stript of his arms, with falchion keen erelong Purposing to strike off his head, and cast His trunk, drawn distant, to the dogs of Troy. But Ajax, with broad shield tower-like, approach\u2019d.155 Then Hector, to his bands retreating, sprang Into his chariot, and to others gave The splendid arms in charge, who into Troy Should bear the destined trophy of his praise, But Ajax with his broad shield guarding stood160 Slain Men\u0153tiades, as for his whelps The lion stands; him through some forest drear Leading his little ones, the hunters meet; 428 Fire glimmers in his looks, and down he draws His whole brow into frowns, covering his eyes;165 So, guarding slain Patroclus, Ajax lour\u2019d. On the other side, with tender grief oppress\u2019d Unspeakable, brave Menelaus stood. But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian band, Son of Hippolochus, in bitter terms170 Indignant, reprimanded Hector thus, Ah, Hector, Chieftain of excelling form, But all unfurnish\u2019d with a warrior\u2019s heart! Unwarranted I deem thy great renown Who art to flight addicted. Think, henceforth,175 How ye shall save city and citadel Thou and thy people born in Troy, alone.", " He said, then Telamonian Ajax huge Arose, and opposite the son arose Of warlike Tydeus, Diomede the brave.1010 Apart from all the people each put on His arms, then moved into the middle space, Lowering terrific, and on fire to fight. The host look\u2019d on amazed. Approaching each The other, thrice they sprang to the assault,1015 And thrice struck hand to hand. Ajax the shield Pierced of his adversary, but the flesh Attain\u2019d not, baffled by his mail within. Then Tydeus\u2019 son, sheer o\u2019er the ample disk Of Ajax, thrust a lance home to his neck,1020 And the Achaians for the life appall\u2019d Of Ajax, bade them, ceasing, share the prize. But the huge falchion with its sheath and belt\u2014 Achilles them on Diomede bestow\u2019d. The hero, next, an iron clod produced1025 Rough from the forge, and wont to task the might Of King E\u00ebtion; but, when him he slew, Pelides, glorious chief, with other spoils From Thebes convey\u2019d it in his fleet to Troy. He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.1030 Come forth who also shall this prize dispute! How far soe\u2019er remote the winner\u2019s fields, This lump shall serve his wants five circling years; His shepherd shall not, or his plower, need In quest of iron seek the distant town,1035 But hence he shall himself their wants supply. [25] 584 Then Polyp\u0153tes brave in fight arose, Arose Leonteus also, godlike chief, With Ajax son of Telamon. Each took His station, and Epe\u00fcs seized the clod.1040 He swung, he cast it, and the Grecians laugh\u2019d.", " Such prayer the people made; then Nestor shook The helmet, and forth leaped, whose most they wished, The lot of Ajax.

My friends! the lot is mine,[8] and my own heart Rejoices also; for I nothing doubt That noble Hector shall be foil\u2019d by me.225 But while I put mine armor on, pray all In silence to the King Saturnian Jove, Lest, while ye pray, the Trojans overhear. Or pray aloud, for whom have we to dread? No man shall my firm standing by his strength230 Unsettle, or for ignorance of mine Me vanquish, who, I hope, brought forth and train\u2019d In Salamis, have, now, not much to learn. He ended.

Or, if not less than Ajax, Hector share 172 Thy love and thy regard, divide the prize240 Of glory, and let each achieve renown! Then Ajax put his radiant armor on, And, arm\u2019d complete, rush\u2019d forward. As huge Mars To battle moves the sons of men between Whom Jove with heart-devouring thirst inspires245 Of war, so moved huge Ajax to the fight, Tower of the Greeks, dilating with a smile His martial features terrible; on feet, Firm-planted, to the combat he advanced Stride after stride, and shook his quivering spear.250 Him viewing, Argos\u2019 universal host Exulted, while a panic loosed the knees Of every Trojan; even Hector\u2019s heart Beat double, but escape for him remain\u2019d None now, or to retreat into his ranks255 Again, from whom himself had challenged forth."], "Who seduces Helen and steals her from her husband?": [" Go thyself\u2014sit thou480 Beside him\u2014for his sake renounce the skies; Watch him, weep for him; till at length his wife He deign to make thee, or perchance his slave.

The Libyans carried no other arms than the spear and a bag of stones. The Trojans were required to sacrifice two lambs; one male of a white color to the Sun, as the father of light, and one female and black to the Earth, the mother and nurse of men. That these were the powers to which they sacrificed appears from their being attested by name in the oath. III. 330. Helen\u2019s weaving the events of the Trojan war in a veil is an agreeable fiction; and one might suppose that it was inherited by Homer, and explained in his Iliad.\u2014Dacier. [Not the grasshopper, but an insect well known in hot countries, and which in Italy is called Cic\u00e1la. The grasshopper rests on the ground, but the favorite abode of the Cic\u00e1la is in the trees and hedges.\u2014Tr.] This episode is remarkable for its beauty. The effect of Helen\u2019s appearance upon the aged counsellors is striking and poetical. It must be borne in mind, that Helen was of divine parentage and unfading beauty, and this will explain the enthusiasm which her sight called forth from the old men. The poet\u2019s skill in taking this method of describing the Grecian chieftains is obvious, and the sketches themselves are living and characteristic to a high degree. The reminiscences of the aged Priam, as their names are announced, and the penitential sorrow of the erring Helen, which the sight of her countrymen, and the recollection of her home, her child, her companions, excite in her bosom, are among the most skilful touches of natural feeling.\u2014Felton.", " Behold her husband! Darest thou not to face The warlike prince? Now learn how brave a Chief60 Thou hast defrauded of his blooming spouse.

But we are base ourselves, or long ago,65 For all thy numerous mischiefs, thou hadst slept Secure beneath a coverlet[5] of stone. [6] Then godlike Alexander thus replied.

BOOK III. 064 ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK. The armies meet. Paris throws out a challenge to the Grecian Princes. Menelaus accepts it. The terms of the combat are adjusted solemnly by Agamemnon on the part of Greece, and by Priam on the part of Troy. The combat ensues, in which Paris is vanquished, whom yet Venus rescues. Agamemnon demands from the Trojans a performance of the covenant. 065 BOOK III.

He ceased; the Queen, her palace entering, charged Her maidens; they, incontinent, throughout350 All Troy convened the matrons, as she bade. Meantime into her wardrobe incense-fumed, Herself descended; there her treasures lay, Works of Sidonian women,[21] whom her son The godlike Paris, when he cross\u2019d the seas355 With Jove-begotten Helen, brought to Troy.

Hector takes the opportunity to find out Paris, and exhorts him to return to the field of battle. An interview succeeds between Hector and Andromache, and Paris, having armed himself in the mean time, comes up with Hector at the close of it, when they sally from the gate together. 141 BOOK VI.

But Diomede, heroic Chief, the son Of Teuthras slew, Axylus. [3] Rich was he,15 And in Arisba (where he dwelt beside 142 The public road, and at his open door Made welcome all) respected and beloved. But of his numerous guests none interposed To avert his woful doom; nor him alone20 He slew, but with him also to the shades Calesius sent, his friend and charioteer."], "How does Agamemnon rally his troops?": [" The Dream also repeats the words of Jupiter without variation, which is considered as a great propriety in delivering a message from the father of gods and men. King of Pylus, an ancient city of Elis. [Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him.\u2014Tr.] [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege. [The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles.\u2014Tr.]", " Back roll\u2019d the Trojan ranks, and faced the Greeks; The Greeks their host to closer phalanx drew;260 The battle was restored, van fronting van They stood, and Agamemnon into fight Sprang foremost, panting for superior fame. Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell! What Trojan first, or what ally of Troy265 Opposed the force of Agamemnon\u2019s arm? Iphidamas, Antenor\u2019s valiant son, 269 Of loftiest stature, who in fertile Thrace Mother of flocks was nourish\u2019d, Cisseus him His grandsire, father of Theano praised270 For loveliest features, in his own abode Rear\u2019d yet a child, and when at length he reach\u2019d The measure of his glorious manhood firm Dismiss\u2019d him not, but, to engage him more, Gave him his daughter. Wedded, he his bride275 As soon deserted, and with galleys twelve Following the rumor\u2019d voyage of the Greeks, The same course steer\u2019d; but at Percope moor\u2019d, And marching thence, arrived on foot at Troy. He first opposed Atrides. They approach\u2019d.280 The spear of Agamemnon wander\u2019d wide; But him Iphidamas on his broad belt Beneath the corselet struck, and, bearing still On his spear-beam, enforced it; but ere yet He pierced the broider\u2019d zone, his point, impress\u2019d285 Against the silver, turn\u2019d, obtuse as lead. Then royal Agamemnon in his hand The weapon grasping, with a lion\u2019s rage Home drew it to himself, and from his gripe Wresting it, with his falchion keen his neck290 Smote full, and stretch\u2019d him lifeless at his foot.", " So slept Iphidamas among the slain; Unhappy! from his virgin bride remote, Associate with the men of Troy in arms He fell, and left her beauties unenjoy\u2019d.295 He gave her much, gave her a hundred beeves, And sheep and goats a thousand from his flocks Promised, for numberless his meadows ranged; But Agamemnon, son of Atreus, him Slew and despoil\u2019d, and through the Grecian host300 Proceeded, laden with his gorgeous arms. Co\u00f6n that sight beheld, illustrious Chief, Antenor\u2019s eldest born, but with dim eyes Through anguish for his brother\u2019s fall. Unseen Of noble Agamemnon, at his side305 270 He cautious stood, and with a spear his arm, Where thickest flesh\u2019d, below his elbow, pierced, Till opposite the glittering point appear\u2019d. A thrilling horror seized the King of men So wounded; yet though wounded so, from fight310 He ceased not, but on Co\u00f6n rush\u2019d, his spear Grasping, well-thriven growth[11] of many a wind. He by the foot drew off Iphidamas, His brother, son of his own sire, aloud Calling the Trojan leaders to his aid;315 When him so occupied with his keen point Atrides pierced his bossy shield beneath. Expiring on Iphidamas he fell Prostrate, and Agamemnon lopp\u2019d his head. Thus, under royal Agamemnon\u2019s hand,320 Antenor\u2019s sons their destiny fulfill\u2019d, And to the house of Ades journey\u2019d both. Through other ranks of warriors then he pass\u2019d, Now with his spear, now with his falchion arm\u2019d, And now with missile force of massy stones,325 While yet his warm blood sallied from the wound.", " An exact account follows of the forces on both sides. 031 BOOK II. [1]All night both Gods and Chiefs equestrian slept, But not the Sire of all. He, waking soon, Mused how to exalt Achilles, and destroy No few in battle at the Grecian fleet. This counsel, at the last, as best he chose5 And likeliest; to dispatch an evil Dream To Agamemnon\u2019s tent, and to his side The phantom summoning, him thus addressed. Haste, evil Dream! Fly to the Grecian fleet, And, entering royal Agamemnon\u2019s tent,10 His ear possess thou thus, omitting nought Of all that I enjoin thee. Bid him arm His universal host, for that the time When the Achaians shall at length possess Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above15 No longer dwell at variance. The request Of Juno hath prevail\u2019d; now, wo to Troy! So charged, the Dream departed. At the ships Well-built arriving of Achaia\u2019s host, He Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sought.20 032 Him sleeping in his tent he found, immersed In soft repose ambrosial. At his head The shadow stood, similitude exact Of Nestor, son of Neleus; sage, with whom In Agamemnon\u2019s thought might none compare.25 His form assumed, the sacred Dream began. Oh son of Atreus the renown\u2019d in arms And in the race! Sleep\u2019st thou? It ill behoves To sleep all night the man of high employ, And charged, as thou art, with a people\u2019s care.30 Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove, Inform thee, that although so far remote, He yet compassionates and thinks on thee With kind solicitude."], "How does Athena help Diomedes?": [" Down from his chariot instant to the ground125 All arm\u2019d he leap\u2019d, and, shaking his sharp spears, Through every phalanx pass\u2019d, rousing again Their courage, and rekindling horrid war. They, turning, faced the Greeks; the Greeks repulsed, Ceased from all carnage, nor supposed they less130 Than that some Deity, the starry skies Forsaken, help\u2019d their foes, so firm they stood. But Hector to the Trojans call\u2019d aloud. Ye dauntless Trojans and confederate powers Call\u2019d from afar! now be ye men, my friends,135 Now summon all the fury of your might! I go to charge our senators and wives That they address the Gods with prayers and vows For our success, and hecatombs devote. So saying the Hero went, and as he strode140 The sable hide that lined his bossy shield Smote on his neck and on his ancle-bone. And now into the middle space between Both hosts, the son of Tydeus and the son Moved of Hippolochus, intent alike145 On furious combat; face to face they stood, And thus heroic Diomede began. Most noble Champion! who of human kind Art thou,[8] whom in the man-ennobling fight I now encounter first? Past all thy peers150 146 I must esteem thee valiant, who hast dared To meet my coming, and my spear defy. Ah! they are sons of miserable sires Who dare my might; but if a God from heaven Thou come, behold! I fight not with the Gods.155 That war Lycurgus son of Dryas waged, And saw not many years.", " Thus Nestor, and his mind bent to his words. Back to \u00c6acides through all the camp980 He ran; and when, still running, he arrived Among Ulysses\u2019 barks, where they had fix\u2019d The forum, where they minister\u2019d the laws, And had erected altars to the Gods, There him Eurypylus, Ev\u00e6mon\u2019s son,985 Illustrious met, deep-wounded in his thigh, And halting-back from battle. From his head The sweat, and from his shoulders ran profuse, And from his perilous wound the sable blood Continual stream\u2019d; yet was his mind composed.990 Him seeing, Men\u0153tiades the brave Compassion felt, and mournful, thus began. Ah hapless senators and Chiefs of Greece! Left ye your native country that the dogs Might fatten on your flesh at distant Troy?995 But tell me, Hero! say, Eurypylus! Have the Achaians power still to withstand The enormous force of Hector, or is this The moment when his spear must pierce us all? To whom Eurypylus, discreet, replied.1000 Patroclus, dear to Jove! there is no help, No remedy. We perish at our ships. The warriors, once most strenuous of the Greeks, Lie wounded in the fleet by foes whose might Increases ever. But thyself afford1005 To me some succor; lead me to my ship; Cut forth the arrow from my thigh; the gore With warm ablution cleanse, and on the wound Smooth unguents spread, the same as by report Achilles taught thee; taught, himself, their use1010 290 By Chiron, Centaur, justest of his kind For Podalirius and Machaon both Are occupied.", " When him Lycaon\u2019s son illustrious saw Scouring the field, and from before his face115 The ranks dispersing wide, at once he bent Against Tydides his elastic bow. 111 The arrow met him in his swift career Sure-aim\u2019d; it struck direct the hollow mail Of his right shoulder, with resistless force120 Transfix\u2019d it, and his hauberk stain\u2019d with blood. Loud shouted then Lycaon\u2019s son renown\u2019d. Rush on, ye Trojans, spur your coursers hard. Our fiercest foe is wounded, and I deem His death not distant far, if me the King[7]125 Jove\u2019s son, indeed, from Lycia sent to Troy. So boasted Pandarus. Yet him the dart Quell\u2019d not. Retreating, at his coursers\u2019 heads He stood, and to the son of Capaneus His charioteer and faithful friend he said.130 Arise, sweet son of Capaneus, dismount, And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft. He spake; at once the son of Capaneus Descending, by its barb the bitter shaft Drew forth; blood spouted through his twisted mail135 Incontinent, and thus the Hero pray\u2019d. Unconquer\u2019d daughter of Jove \u00c6gis-arm\u2019d! If ever me, propitious, or my sire Thou hast in furious fight help\u2019d heretofore, Now aid me also.

[8] He prayed, and Pallas heard; she braced his limbs, She wing\u2019d him with alacrity divine,145 And, standing at his side, him thus bespake.", " Now from the shoulders of the equestrian Chief Tydides tear we off his splendid mail, The work of Vulcan. [10] May we take but these, 192 I have good hope that, ere this night be spent,225 The Greeks shall climb their galleys and away. So vaunted he, but Juno with disdain His proud boast heard, and shuddering in her throne, Rock\u2019d the Olympian; turning then toward The Ocean\u2019s mighty sovereign, thus she spake.230 Alas! earth-shaking sovereign of the waves, Feel\u2019st thou no pity of the perishing Greeks? Yet Greece, in Helice, with gifts nor few Nor sordid, and in \u00c6g\u00e6, honors thee, Whom therefore thou shouldst prosper.

Juno! rash in speech! what word240 Hath \u2019scaped thy lips? never, with my consent, Shall we, the powers subordinate, in arms With Jove contend. He far excels us all. So they. Meantime, the trench and wall between,[11] The narrow interval with steeds was fill\u2019d245 Close throng\u2019d and shielded warriors. There immew\u2019d By Priameian Hector, fierce as Mars, They stood, for Hector had the help of Jove. And now with blazing fire their gallant barks He had consumed, but Juno moved the mind250 Of Agamemnon, vigilant himself, To exhortation of Achaia\u2019s host. Through camp and fleet the monarch took his way, And, his wide robe imperial in his hand, High on Ulysses\u2019 huge black galley stood,255 The central ship conspicuous; thence his voice Might reach the most remote of all the line At each extreme, where Ajax had his tent 193 Pitch\u2019d, and Achilles, fearless of surprise."], "Which gods does Diomedes wound?": [" Then Diomede on him Rush\u2019d furious in his turn, and Pallas plunged The bright spear deep into his cinctured waist Dire was the wound, and plucking back the spear She tore him.

Such as the dimness is when summer winds1025 Breathe hot, and sultry mist obscures the sky, Such brazen Mars to Diomede appear\u2019d By clouds accompanied in his ascent Into the boundless ether.

Jove, Father! Seest thou these outrageous acts Unmoved with anger? Such are day by day1035 The dreadful mischiefs by the Gods contrived Against each other, for the sake of man. Thou art thyself the cause. Thou hast produced A foolish daughter petulant, addict To evil only and injurious deeds;1040 There is not in Olympus, save herself, Who feels not thy control; but she her will Gratifies ever, and reproof from thee Finds none, because, pernicious as she is, She is thy daughter.

To whom Men\u0153tius\u2019 gallant son replied. Hero! Eurypylus! how shall we act In this perplexity? what course pursue? I seek the brave Achilles, to whose ear1020 I bear a message from the ancient chief Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks. Yet will I not, even for such a cause, My friend! abandon thee in thy distress. He ended, and his arms folding around1025 The warrior bore him thence into his tent. His servant, on his entrance, spread the floor With hides, on which Patroclus at his length Extended him, and with his knife cut forth The rankling point; with tepid lotion, next,1030 He cleansed the gore, and with a bitter root Bruised small between his palms, sprinkled the wound. At once, the anodyne his pain assuaged, The wound was dried within, and the blood ceased. It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from the Gods forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their general at their head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon this hinge turns the whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of Patroclus, and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles. The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents.", " Thus Nestor, and his mind bent to his words.

It would perhaps be too much to say, that in this partiality to Hector, we detect the spirit of the Dorian worship, the only Paganism of antiquity that tended to perfect the individual\u2014Apollo being the expression of the moral harmony of the universe, and the great spirit of the Dorian culture being to make a perfect man, an incarnation of the \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2. This Homer could only have known intuitively. In making Apollo author of the plague, he was confounded with Helios, which was frequent afterwards, but is not seen elsewhere in Homer. The arrows of Apollo were \u201csilent as light,\u201d and their emblem the sun\u2019s rays. The analogies are multitudinous between the natural and intellectual sun; but Helios and Apollo were two.\u2014E.P.P. There is something exceedingly venerable in this appearance of the priest. He comes with the ensigns of the gods to whom he belongs, with the laurel wreath, to show that he was a suppliant, and a golden sceptre, which the ancients gave in particular to Apollo, as they did one of silver to Diana. The art of this speech is remarkable. Chryses considers the army of Greeks, as made up of troops, partly from the kingdoms and partly from democracies, and therefore begins with a distinction that includes all. Then, as priest of Apollo, he prays that they may obtain the two blessings they most desire\u2014the conquest of Troy and a safe return.", " But even him, oh Sovereign of the storms! I am prepared to admonish that he quit The battle, and retire where thou command\u2019st. So she; then smiled the Sire of Gods and men,60 And in wing\u2019d accents answer thus return\u2019d.

Apollo\u2019s part shall be to rouse again Hector to battle, to inspire his soul Afresh with courage, and all memory thence To banish of the pangs which now he feels.75 Apollo also shall again repulse Achaia\u2019s host, which with base panic fill\u2019d, Shall even to Achilles\u2019 ships be driven. Achilles shall his valiant friend exhort Patroclus forth; him under Ilium\u2019s walls80 Shall glorious Hector slay; but many a youth Shall perish by Patroclus first, with whom, My noble son Sarpedon. Peleus\u2019 son, Resentful of Patroclus\u2019 death, shall slay Hector, and I will urge ceaseless, myself,85 Thenceforth the routed Trojans back again, Till by Minerva\u2019s aid the Greeks shall take Ilium\u2019s proud city; till that day arrive My wrath shall burn, nor will I one permit 364 Of all the Immortals to assist the Greeks,90 But will perform Achilles\u2019 whole desire.", " Then, the cloud-Assembler God thus to Apollo spake. Hence, my Apollo! to the Trojan Chief275 Hector; for earth-encircler Neptune, awed By fear of my displeasure imminent, Hath sought the sacred Deep. Else, all the Gods Who compass Saturn in the nether realms, Had even there our contest heard, I ween,280 And heard it loudly. But that he retreats Although at first incensed, shunning my wrath, Is salutary both for him and me, Whose difference else had not been healed with ease. Take thou my shaggy \u00c6gis, and with force285 Smiting it, terrify the Chiefs of Greece. As for illustrious Hector, him I give To thy peculiar care; fail not to rouse His fiercest courage, till he push the Greeks To Hellespont, and to their ships again;290 Thenceforth to yield to their afflicted host Some pause from toil, shall be my own concern.

Say, Hector, Priam\u2019s son! why sittest here Feeble and spiritless, and from thy host Apart? what new disaster hath befall\u2019n?305 To whom with difficulty thus replied The warlike Chief.\u2014But tell me who art Thou, Divine inquirer!", " It is such, that no person familiar with both, can read either without being reminded of the other; and it is in those breaks and pauses, to which the numbers of the English poet are so much indebted both for their dignity and variety, that he chiefly copies the Grecian. But these are graces to which rhyme is not competent; so broken, it loses all its music; of which any person may convince himself by reading a page only of any of our poets anterior to Denham, Waller, and Dryden. A translator of Homer, therefore, seems directed by Homer himself to the use of blank verse, as to that alone in which he can be rendered with any tolerable representation of his manner in this particular.

Were this true, they would have reason on their side; for the author is certainly best entitled to applause who succeeds against the greatest difficulty, and in verse that calls for the most artificial management in its construction."], "What do Hera and Athena try to convince Zeus to do as the battle is raging on?": [" Homer magnifies the ambush as the boldest enterprise of war. They went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of sceptre. Ovid, in speaking of Jupiter, describes him as resting on his sceptre.\u2014Spence. From the description here given, it would appear to have been a young tree cut from the root and stripped of its branches. It was the custom of Kings to swear by their sceptres. For an account of the contest between the Centaurs and Lapiths here referred to, see Grecian and Roman Mythology. In _antiquity_, a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_, any sacrifice of a large number of victims. [The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids.", " The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue. Why it was \u00c6g\u00e6on, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was called \u00c6g\u00e6on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub\u0153a, the seat of Poseidon \u00c6g\u00e6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller. Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an allegory.", " Host toward host with full collected force600 They moved direct. Then Mars through all the field Took wide his range, and overhung the war With night, in aid of Troy, at the command Of Ph\u0153bus of the golden sword; for he Perceiving Pallas from the field withdrawn,605 Patroness of the Greeks, had Mars enjoin\u2019d To rouse the spirit of the Trojan host. Meantime Apollo from his unctuous shrine Sent forth restored and with new force inspired \u00c6neas. He amidst his warriors stood,610 Who him with joy beheld still living, heal\u2019d, And all his strength possessing unimpair\u2019d. Yet no man ask\u2019d him aught. No leisure now For question was; far other thoughts had they; Such toils the archer of the silver bow,615 Wide-slaughtering Mars, and Discord as at first Raging implacable, for them prepared. Ulysses, either Ajax, Diomede\u2014 These roused the Greeks to battle, who themselves The force fear\u2019d nothing, or the shouts of Troy,620 But steadfast stood, like clouds by Jove amass\u2019d On lofty mountains, while the fury sleeps 125 Of Boreas, and of all the stormy winds Shrill-voiced, that chase the vapors when they blow, So stood the Greeks, expecting firm the approach625 Of Ilium\u2019s powers, and neither fled nor fear\u2019d. Then Agamemnon the embattled host On all sides ranging, cheer\u2019d them. Now, he cried, Be steadfast, fellow warriors, now be men! Hold fast a sense of honor.

Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck, By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes470 She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake. Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish Now to ensnare me? Wouldst thou lure me, say, To some fair city of M\u00e6onian name Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still?475 Hast thou some human favorite also there?

Ajax with Menelaus flies to the relief of Ulysses, and Eurypylus, soon after, to the relief of Ajax. While he is employed in assisting Ajax, he is shot in the thigh by Paris, who also wounds Machaon. Nestor conveys Machaon from the field. Achilles dispatches Patroclus to the tent of Nestor, and Nestor takes that occasion to exhort Patroclus to engage in battle, clothed in the armor of Achilles. 261 BOOK XI.

So threaten\u2019d Hector, and shall now perform.55 Alas! alas! the Achaians brazen-greaved All, like Achilles, have deserted me Resentful, and decline their fleet\u2019s defence. To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied. Those threats are verified; nor Jove himself60 343 The Thunderer can disappoint them now; For our chief strength in which we trusted most That it should guard impregnably secure Our navy and ourselves, the wall hath fallen. Hence all this conflict by our host sustain\u2019d65 Among the ships; nor could thy keenest sight Inform thee where in the Achaian camp Confusion most prevails, such deaths are dealt Promiscuous, and the cry ascends to heaven.

They went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of sceptre. Ovid, in speaking of Jupiter, describes him as resting on his sceptre.\u2014Spence. From the description here given, it would appear to have been a young tree cut from the root and stripped of its branches. It was the custom of Kings to swear by their sceptres. For an account of the contest between the Centaurs and Lapiths here referred to, see Grecian and Roman Mythology. In _antiquity_, a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_, any sacrifice of a large number of victims. [The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids.", " The Dream also repeats the words of Jupiter without variation, which is considered as a great propriety in delivering a message from the father of gods and men. King of Pylus, an ancient city of Elis. [Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him.\u2014Tr.] [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege. [The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles.\u2014Tr.]", " The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue. Why it was \u00c6g\u00e6on, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was called \u00c6g\u00e6on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub\u0153a, the seat of Poseidon \u00c6g\u00e6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller. Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an allegory.", " In the following review of the army, we see the skill of an accomplished general as well as the characters of the leaders whom Agamemnon addresses. He begins with an address to the army in general, and then turns to individuals. To the brave he urges their secure hopes of conquest, since the gods must punish perjury; to the timid, their inevitable destruction if the enemy should burn their ships. After this he flies from rank to rank, skilfully addressing each ally, and presents a lively picture of a great mind in the highest emotion. The ancients usually in their feasts divided to the guests in equal portions, except they took particular occasion to show distinction. It was then considered the highest mark of honor to be allotted the best portion of meat and wine, and to be allowed an exemption from the laws of the feast in drinking wine unmingled and without measure. This custom was much more ancient than the time of the Trojan war, and we find it practised in the banquet given by Joseph to his brethren. [Diverse interpretations are given of this passage. I have adopted that which to me appeared most plausible. It seems to be a caution against the mischiefs that might ensue, should the horses be put under the management of a driver with whom they were unacquainted.\u2014The scholium by Villoisson much countenances this solution.\u2014Tr.] [Here Nestor only mentions the name of Ereuthalion, knowing the present to be an improper time for story-telling; in the seventh book he relates his fight and victory at length."], "Who proposes returning to Greece because the war was a failure?": [" But noble Menelaus threw behind Meriones, companion in the field,655 Of King Idomeneus, a lance\u2019s flight, For slowest were his steeds, and he, to rule The chariot in the race, least skill\u2019d of all. Last came Eumelus drawing to the goal, Himself, his splendid chariot, and his mares660 Driving before him. Peleus\u2019 rapid son Beheld him with compassion, and, amid The Argives, in wing\u2019d accents thus he spake. Here comes the most expert, driving his steeds Before him. Just it were that he received665 The second prize; Tydides claims the first. He said, and all applauded the award. Then had Achilles to Eumelus given The mare (for such the pleasure seem\u2019d of all) Had not the son of mighty Nestor risen,670 Antilochus, who pleaded thus his right. Achilles! acting as thou hast proposed, Thou shalt offend me much, for thou shalt take The prize from me, because the Gods, his steeds And chariot-yoke disabling, render\u2019d vain675 His efforts, and no failure of his own. 574 It was his duty to have sought the Gods In prayer, then had he not, following on foot His coursers, hindmost of us all arrived. But if thou pity him, and deem it good,680 Thou hast much gold, much brass, and many sheep In thy pavilion; thou hast maidens fair, And coursers also. Of thy proper stores Hereafter give to him a richer prize Than this, or give it now, so shall the Greeks685 Applaud thee; but this mare yield I to none; Stand forth the Grecian who desires to win That recompense, and let him fight with me.", " For when he left, that day, the gallant barks 444 Idomeneus had sought the field on foot, And triumph proud, full sure, to Ilium\u2019s host740 Had yielded now, but that with rapid haste C\u0153ranus drove to his relief, from him The fate averting which himself incurr\u2019d Victim of Hector\u2019s homicidal arm.

Dismounted down he fell, and from his hand Let slide the flowing reins, which, to the earth Stooping, Meriones in haste resumed,750 And briefly thus Idomeneus address\u2019d. Now drive, and cease not, to the fleet of Greece! Thyself see\u2019st victory no longer ours. He said; Idomeneus whom, now, dismay Seized also, with his lash plying severe755 The coursers ample-maned, flew to the fleet.

Priam begins not with a display of the treasures he has brought for the redemption of Hector\u2019s body, but with a pathetic address to the feelings of Achilles. Homer well knew that neither gold nor silver would influence the heart of a young and generous warrior, but that persuasion would. The old king therefore, with a judicious abruptness, avails himself of his most powerful plea at once, and seizes the sympathy of the hero, before he has time to recollect who it is that addresses him.

Diomede and Ulysses are inspired with a love of glory; Dolon with the thirst of gain. They proceed with caution and bravery; he with rashness and vanity. They go in conjunction; he alone.

Diomede, who was most renowned for valor, might have given a wrong interpretation to this omen, and have been discouraged from proceeding in the attempt. For though it really signified that, as the bird was not seen, but only heard, so they should not be discovered by the Trojans, but perform actions of which all Troy should hear with sorrow; yet, on the other hand, it might imply that, as they discovered the bird by the noise of its wings, so the noise they should make would betray them to the Trojans. Pallas does not send the bird sacred to herself, but the heron, because that is a bird of prey, and denoted that they should spoil the Trojans. Dolon seems to have been eminent for wealth, and Hector summons him to the assembly as one of the chiefs of Troy. He was known to the Greeks, perhaps, from his having passed between the two armies as a herald. Ancient writers observe, that it was the office of Dolon that led him to offer himself in this service. The sacredness attached to it gave him hopes that they would not violate his person, should he chance to be taken; and his riches he knew were sufficient to purchase his liberty. Besides these advantages, he probably trusted to his swiftness to escape pursuit.

They went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of sceptre. Ovid, in speaking of Jupiter, describes him as resting on his sceptre.\u2014Spence. From the description here given, it would appear to have been a young tree cut from the root and stripped of its branches. It was the custom of Kings to swear by their sceptres. For an account of the contest between the Centaurs and Lapiths here referred to, see Grecian and Roman Mythology. In _antiquity_, a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_, any sacrifice of a large number of victims. [The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids.", " The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue. Why it was \u00c6g\u00e6on, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was called \u00c6g\u00e6on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub\u0153a, the seat of Poseidon \u00c6g\u00e6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller. Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an allegory.", " Then Ph\u0153bus from his head his helmet dash\u2019d To earth; sonorous at the feet it roll\u2019d Of many a prancing steed, and all the crest970 Defilement gather\u2019d gross of dust and blood, Then first; till then, impossible; for how Should dust the tresses of that helmet shame With which Achilles fighting fenced his head 417 Illustrious, and his graceful brows divine?975 But Jove now made it Hector\u2019s; he awhile Bore it, himself to swift perdition doom\u2019d His spear brass-mounted, ponderous, huge and long, Fell shiver\u2019d from his grasp.

Then came a Dardan Chief, who from behind Enforced a pointed lance into his back985 Between the shoulders; Panthus\u2019 son was he, Euphorbus, famous for equestrian skill, For spearmanship, and in the rapid race Past all of equal age. He twenty men (Although a learner yet of martial feats,990 And by his steeds then first to battle borne) Dismounted. He, Patroclus, mighty Chief! First threw a lance at thee, which yet life Quell\u2019d not; then snatching hasty from the wound His ashen beam, he ran into the crowd,995 Nor dared confront in fight even the unarm\u2019d Patroclus.

At once, the anodyne his pain assuaged, The wound was dried within, and the blood ceased. It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from the Gods forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their general at their head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon this hinge turns the whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of Patroclus, and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles. The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents.", " since the earth expects Me next, I will not thy funereal rites Finish, till I shall bring both head and arms Of that bold Chief who slew thee, to my tent.

Why it was \u00c6g\u00e6on, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was called \u00c6g\u00e6on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub\u0153a, the seat of Poseidon \u00c6g\u00e6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller. Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an allegory."], "What do Hector and Paris find when they get to the left end of the line?": [" I from yon eminence will learn the cause. So saying, he took a shield radiant with brass10 There lying in the tent, the shield well-forged Of valiant Thrasymedes, his own son (For he had borne to fight his father\u2019s shield) And arming next his hand with a keen lance Stood forth before the tent. Thence soon he saw15 Foul deeds and strange, the Grecian host confused, Their broken ranks flying before the host Of Ilium, and the rampart overthrown. As when the wide sea, darken\u2019d over all Its silent flood, forebodes shrill winds to blow,20 The doubtful waves roll yet to neither side, Till swept at length by a decisive gale;[1] 342 So stood the senior, with distressful doubts Conflicting anxious, whether first to seek The Grecian host, or Agamemnon\u2019s self25 The sovereign, and at length that course preferr\u2019d. Meantime with mutual carnage they the field Spread far and wide, and by spears double-edged Smitten, and by the sword their corselets rang. The royal Chiefs ascending from the fleet,30 Ulysses, Diomede, and Atreus\u2019 son Imperial Agamemnon, who had each Bled in the battle, met him on his way. For from the war remote they had updrawn Their galleys on the shore of the gray Deep,35 The foremost to the plain, and at the sterns Of that exterior line had built the wall. For, spacious though it were, the shore alone That fleet sufficed not, incommoding much The people; wherefore they had ranged the ships40 Line above line gradual, and the bay Between both promontories, all was fill\u2019d.", " Such prayer the priestess offer\u2019d, and such prayer380 All present; whom Minerva heard averse. But Hector to the palace sped meantime Of Alexander, which himself had built, Aided by every architect of name Illustrious then in Troy. Chamber it had,385 Wide hall, proud dome, and on the heights of Troy Near-neighboring Hector\u2019s house and Priam\u2019s stood. There enter\u2019d Hector, Jove-beloved, a spear Its length eleven cubits in his hand, Its glittering head bound with a ring of gold.390 He found within his chamber whom he sought, Polishing with exactest care his arms Resplendent, shield and hauberk fingering o\u2019er With curious touch, and tampering with his bow. [24] Helen of Argos with her female train395 Sat occupied, the while, to each in turn Some splendid task assigning. Hector fix\u2019d His eyes on Paris, and him stern rebuked. Thy sullen humors, Paris, are ill-timed. 154 The people perish at our lofty walls;400 The flames of war have compass\u2019d Troy around And thou hast kindled them; who yet thyself That slackness show\u2019st which in another seen Thou would\u2019st resent to death. Haste, seek the field This moment, lest, the next, all Ilium blaze.405 To whom thus Paris, graceful as a God. Since, Hector, thou hast charged me with a fault, And not unjustly, I will answer make, And give thou special heed. That here I sit, The cause is sorrow, which I wish\u2019d to soothe410 In secret, not displeasure or revenge.", " The Trojans being closely pursued, Hector by the advice of Helenus enters Troy, and recommends it to Hecuba to go in solemn procession to the temple of Minerva; she with the matrons goes accordingly. Hector takes the opportunity to find out Paris, and exhorts him to return to the field of battle. An interview succeeds between Hector and Andromache, and Paris, having armed himself in the mean time, comes up with Hector at the close of it, when they sally from the gate together. 141 BOOK VI. Thus was the field forsaken by the Gods. And now success proved various; here the Greeks With their extended spears, the Trojans there Prevail\u2019d alternate, on the champain spread The Xanthus and the Simo\u00efs between. [1]5 First Telamonian Ajax,[2] bulwark firm Of the Achaians, broke the Trojan ranks, And kindled for the Greeks a gleam of hope, Slaying the bravest of the Thracian band, Huge Acamas, Eusorus\u2019 son; him first10 Full on the shaggy crest he smote, and urged The spear into his forehead; through his skull The bright point pass\u2019d, and darkness veil\u2019d his eyes. But Diomede, heroic Chief, the son Of Teuthras slew, Axylus. [3] Rich was he,15 And in Arisba (where he dwelt beside 142 The public road, and at his open door Made welcome all) respected and beloved. But of his numerous guests none interposed To avert his woful doom; nor him alone20 He slew, but with him also to the shades Calesius sent, his friend and charioteer.", " The epithets that would consent to an English form I have preserved as epithets; others that would not, I have melted into the context. There are none, I believe, which I have not translated in one way or other, though the reader will not find them repeated so often as most of them are in Homer, for a reason that need not be mentioned. Few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the Iliad or Odyssey by their own name only, but their patronymic is given also. To this ceremonial I have generally attended, because it is a circumstance of my author\u2019s manner. Homer never allots less than a whole line to the introduction of a speaker. No, not even when the speech itself is no longer than the line that leads it. A practice to which, since he never departs from it, he must have been determined by some cogent reason. He probably deemed it a formality necessary to the majesty of his narration. In this article, therefore, I have scrupulously adhered to my pattern, considering these introductory lines as heralds in a procession; important persons, because employed to usher in persons more important than themselves. It has been my point every where to be as little verbose as possible, though; at the same time, my constant determination not to sacrifice my author\u2019s full meaning to an affected brevity. In the affair of style, I have endeavored neither to creep nor to bluster, for no author is so likely to betray his translator into both these faults, as Homer, though himself never guilty of either."], "What does the appearance of the eagle signal?": [" Others, as obstinate, at other gates Such deeds perform\u2019d, that to enumerate all Were difficult, unless to power divine.220 For fierce the hail of stones from end to end Smote on the barrier; anguish fill\u2019d the Greeks. Yet, by necessity constrain\u2019d, their ships They guarded still; nor less the Gods themselves, Patrons of Greece, all sorrow\u2019d at the sight.225 At once the valiant Lapith\u00e6 began Terrible conflict, and Pirithous\u2019 son Brave Polyp\u0153tes through his helmet pierced Damasus; his resplendent point the brass Sufficed not to withstand; entering, it crush\u2019d230 The bone within, and mingling all his brain With his own blood, his onset fierce repress\u2019d. Pylon and Ormenus he next subdued. Meantime Leonteus, branch of Mars, his spear Hurl\u2019d at Hippomachus, whom through his belt235 He pierced; then drawing forth his falchion keen, Through all the multitude he flew to smite Antiphates, and with a downright stroke Fell\u2019d him. I\u00e4menus and Menon next He slew, with brave Orestes, whom he heap\u2019d,240 All three together, on the fertile glebe. While them the Lapith\u00e6 of their bright arms Despoil\u2019d, Polydamas and Hector stood (With all the bravest youths and most resolved To burst the barrier and to fire the fleet)245 Beside the foss, pondering the event. For, while they press\u2019d to pass, they spied a bird Sublime in air, an eagle. Right between Both hosts he soar\u2019d (the Trojan on his left) A serpent bearing in his pounces clutch\u2019d250 Enormous, dripping blood, but lively still And mindful of revenge; for from beneath 300 The eagle\u2019s breast, updarting fierce his head, Fast by the throat he struck him; anguish-sick The eagle cast him down into the space255 Between the hosts, and, clanging loud his plumes As the wind bore him, floated far away.", " Thou art woman now. Go, timorous girl! Thou never shalt behold190 Me flying, climb our battlements, or lead Our women captive. I will slay thee first. He ceased. Then Diomede in dread suspense Thrice purposed, turning, to withstand the foe, And thrice in thunder from the mountain-top195 Jove gave the signal of success to Troy. When Hector thus the Trojans hail\u2019d aloud. Trojans and Lycians, and close-warring sons 191 Of Dardanus, oh summon all your might, Now, now be men! I know that from his heart200 Saturnian Jove glory and bright success For me prepares, but havoc for the Greeks. Fools! they shall find this wall which they have raised Too weak to check my course, a feeble guard Contemptible; such also is the trench;205 My steeds shall slight it with an easy leap. But when ye see me in their fleet arrived, Remember fire. Then bring me flaming brands That I may burn their galleys and themselves Slaughter beside them, struggling in the smoke. [8]210 He spake, and thus encouraged next his steeds. Xanthus! Podargus! and ye generous pair \u00c6thon and glossy Lampus! now requite Mine, and the bounty of Andromache, Far-famed E\u00ebtion\u2019s daughter; she your bowl215 With corn fresh-flavor\u2019d and with wine full oft Hath mingled, your refreshment seeking first Ere mine, who have a youthful husband\u2019s claim. [9] Now follow! now be swift; that we may seize The shield of Nestor, bruited to the skies220 As golden all, trappings and disk alike.", " However this may be, we know that the Oriental nations were in possession of the art of alphabetical writing it a very early period, and before the Trojan war. It cannot, then, seem very improbable, that the authors of the Iliad should also have been acquainted with it.\u2014Felton. The Solymi were an ancient nation inhabiting the mountainous parts of Asia Minor, between Lycia and Pisidia. Pliny mentions them as having become extinct in his time. It was the custom in ancient times, upon the performance of any signal service by kings or great men, for the public to grant them a tract of land as a reward. When Sarpedon, in the 12th Book, exhorts Glaucus to behave valiantly, he reminds him of these possessions granted by his countrymen. The laws of hospitality were considered so sacred, that a friendship contracted under their observance was preferred to the ties of consanguinity and alliance, and regarded as obligatory even to the third and fourth generation. Diomede and Glaucus here became friends, on the ground of their grandfathers having been mutual guests. The presents made on these occasions were preserved by families, as it was considered obligatory to transmit them as memorials to their children. [\u039e\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9.] The Sc\u00e6an gate opened to the field of battle, and was the one through which the Trojans made their excursions. Close to this stood the beech tree sacred to Jupiter, and often mentioned in connection with it.", " This scene, for true and unaffected pathos, delicate touches of nature, and a profound knowledge of the human heart, has rarely been equalled, and never surpassed, among all the efforts of genius during the three thousand years that have gone by since it was conceived and composed.\u2014Felton. Footnotes for Book VII: Holding the spear in this manner was, in ancient warfare, understood as a signal to discontinue the fight. The challenge of Hector and the consternation of the Greeks, presents much the same scene as the challenge of Goliath, 1 Samuel, ch. 17: \u201cAnd he stood and cried to the armies of Israel;\u2014Choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants.\u2014When Saul and all Israel heard the words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.\u201d It was an ancient custom for warriors to dedicate trophies of this kind to the temples of their tutelary deities. [The club-bearer.] [It is a word used by Dryden.] Homer refers every thing, even the chance of the lots, to the disposition of the gods. [Agamemnon.] The lot was merely a piece of wood or shell, or any thing of the kind that was at hand. Probably it had some private mark, and not the name, as it was only recognized by the owner. This reply is supposed to allude to some gesture made by Ajax in approaching Hector. The heralds were considered as sacred persons, the delegates of Mercury, and inviolable by the laws of nations."], "What does Hera do to Zeus?": [" Homer magnifies the ambush as the boldest enterprise of war.

Compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language of our country, that I employed them without fear or scruple. To have abstained from them in a blank verse translation of Homer, who abounds with them, and from whom our poets probably first adopted them, would have been strange indeed. But though the genius of our language favors the formation of such words almost as much as that of the Greek, it happens sometimes, that a Grecian compound either cannot be rendered in English at all, or, at best, but awkwardly. For this reason, and because I found that some readers much disliked them, I have expunged many; retaining, according to my best judgment, the most eligible only, and making less frequent the repetitions even of these. I know not that I can add any thing material on the subject of this last revisal, unless it be proper to give the reason why the Iliad, though greatly altered, has undergone much fewer alterations than the Odyssey. The true reason I believe is this. The Iliad demanded my utmost possible exertions; it seemed to meet me like an ascent almost perpendicular, which could not be surmounted at less cost than of all the labor that I could bestow on it.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ILIAD *** Produced by Ted Garvin, Melissa Er-Raqabi, Fred Robinson and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net THE ILIAD OF HOMER, TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE BY WILLIAM COWPER.

[The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids.", " The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue. Why it was \u00c6g\u00e6on, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was called \u00c6g\u00e6on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub\u0153a, the seat of Poseidon \u00c6g\u00e6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller. Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an allegory."], "What does Patroclus convince Achilles to do?": [" [7] Patroclus silent sat, and he alone, Before him, on \u00c6acides intent,235 Expecting still when he should cease to sing. The messengers advanced (Ulysses first) Into his presence; at the sight, his harp Still in his hand, Achilles from his seat Started astonish\u2019d; nor with less amaze240 Patroclus also, seeing them, arose. Achilles seized their hands, and thus he spake. [8] 215 Hail friends! ye all are welcome. Urgent cause Hath doubtless brought you, whom I dearest hold (Though angry still) of all Achaia\u2019s host.245 So saying, he introduced them, and on seats Placed them with purple arras overspread, Then thus bespake Patroclus standing nigh. Son of Men\u00e6tius! bring a beaker more Capacious, and replenish it with wine250 Diluted[9] less; then give to each his cup; For dearer friends than these who now arrive My roof beneath, or worthier, have I none. He ended, and Patroclus quick obey\u2019d, Whom much he loved. Achilles, then, himself255 Advancing near the fire an ample[10] tray, Spread goats\u2019 flesh on it, with the flesh of sheep And of a fatted brawn; of each a chine. Automedon attending held them fast, While with sharp steel Achilles from the bone260 Sliced thin the meat, then pierced it with the spits. Meantime the godlike Men\u00e6tiades Kindled fierce fire, and when the flame declined, Raked wide the embers, laid the meat to roast, And taking sacred salt from the hearth-side265 Where it was treasured, shower\u2019d it o\u2019er the feast.", " Hector puts on the armor of Achilles.

But these are graces to which rhyme is not competent; so broken, it loses all its music; of which any person may convince himself by reading a page only of any of our poets anterior to Denham, Waller, and Dryden. A translator of Homer, therefore, seems directed by Homer himself to the use of blank verse, as to that alone in which he can be rendered with any tolerable representation of his manner in this particular. A remark which I am naturally led to make by a desire to conciliate, if possible, some, who, rather unreasonably partial to rhyme, demand it on all occasions, and seem persuaded that poetry in our language is a vain attempt without it. Verse, that claims to be verse in right of its metre only, they judge to be such rather by courtesy than by kind, on an apprehension that it costs the writer little trouble, that he has only to give his lines their prescribed number of syllables, and so far as the mechanical part is concerned, all is well. Were this true, they would have reason on their side; for the author is certainly best entitled to applause who succeeds against the greatest difficulty, and in verse that calls for the most artificial management in its construction."], "Who kills Zeus\u2019s son Sarpedon?": [" She said, from whom the Sire of Gods and men Dissented not, but on the earth distill\u2019d A sanguine shower in honor of a son Dear to him, whom Patroclus on the field555 Of fruitful Troy should slay, far from his home.

Compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language of our country, that I employed them without fear or scruple. To have abstained from them in a blank verse translation of Homer, who abounds with them, and from whom our poets probably first adopted them, would have been strange indeed. But though the genius of our language favors the formation of such words almost as much as that of the Greek, it happens sometimes, that a Grecian compound either cannot be rendered in English at all, or, at best, but awkwardly. For this reason, and because I found that some readers much disliked them, I have expunged many; retaining, according to my best judgment, the most eligible only, and making less frequent the repetitions even of these. I know not that I can add any thing material on the subject of this last revisal, unless it be proper to give the reason why the Iliad, though greatly altered, has undergone much fewer alterations than the Odyssey.

Their orisons ended to the daughter dread350 Of mighty Jove, lion-like they advanced Through shades of night, through carnage, arms and blood. Nor Hector to his gallant host indulged Sleep, but convened the leaders; leader none Or senator of all his host he left355 Unsummon\u2019d, and his purpose thus promulged. Where is the warrior who for rich reward, Such as shall well suffice him, will the task Adventurous, which I propose, perform? A chariot with two steeds of proudest height,360 Surpassing all in the whole fleet of Greece Shall be his portion, with immortal praise, Who shall the well-appointed ships approach Courageous, there to learn if yet a guard 248 As heretofore, keep them, or if subdued365 Beneath us, the Achaians flight intend, And worn with labor have no will to watch. So Hector spake, but answer none return\u2019d. There was a certain Trojan, Dolon named,[13] Son of Eumedes herald of the Gods,370 Rich both in gold and brass, but in his form Unsightly; yet the man was swift of foot, Sole brother of five sisters; he his speech To Hector and the Trojans thus address\u2019d. My spirit, Hector, prompts me, and my mind375 Endued with manly vigor, to approach Yon gallant ships, that I may tidings hear. But come.

BOOK X. 236 ARGUMENT OF THE TENTH BOOK. Diomede and Ulysses enter the Trojan host by night, and slay Rhesus. 237 BOOK X. All night the leaders of the host of Greece Lay sunk in soft repose, all, save the Chief,[1] The son of Atreus; him from thought to thought Roving solicitous, no sleep relieved. As when the spouse of beauteous Juno, darts5 His frequent fires, designing heavy rain Immense, or hail-storm, or field-whitening snow, Or else wide-throated war calamitous, So frequent were the groans by Atreus\u2019 son Heaved from his inmost heart, trembling with dread.10 For cast he but his eye toward the plain Of Ilium, there, astonish\u2019d he beheld The city fronted with bright fires, and heard Pipes, and recorders, and the hum of war; But when again the Grecian fleet he view\u2019d,15 And thought on his own people, then his hair Uprooted elevating to the Gods, He from his generous bosom groan\u2019d again. At length he thus resolved; of all the Greeks To seek Neleian Nestor first, with whom20 He might, perchance, some plan for the defence Of the afflicted Dana\u00ef devise. Rising, he wrapp\u2019d his tunic to his breast, 238 And to his royal feet unsullied bound His sandals; o\u2019er his shoulders, next, he threw25 Of amplest size a lion\u2019s tawny skin That swept his footsteps, dappled o\u2019er with blood, Then took his spear."], "What does Zeus do to Hector?": [" Homer magnifies the ambush as the boldest enterprise of war. They went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of sceptre. Ovid, in speaking of Jupiter, describes him as resting on his sceptre.\u2014Spence. From the description here given, it would appear to have been a young tree cut from the root and stripped of its branches. It was the custom of Kings to swear by their sceptres. For an account of the contest between the Centaurs and Lapiths here referred to, see Grecian and Roman Mythology. In _antiquity_, a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_, any sacrifice of a large number of victims. [The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids.", " The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue. Why it was \u00c6g\u00e6on, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was called \u00c6g\u00e6on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub\u0153a, the seat of Poseidon \u00c6g\u00e6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller. Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an allegory.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ILIAD *** Produced by Ted Garvin, Melissa Er-Raqabi, Fred Robinson and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net THE ILIAD OF HOMER, TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE BY WILLIAM COWPER.

Whether a translation of Homer may be best executed in blank verse or in rhyme, is a question in the decision of which no man can find difficulty, who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be, or who is in any degree practically acquainted with those very different kinds of versification. I will venture to assert that a just translation of any ancient poet in rhyme, is impossible. No human ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing every couplet with sounds homotonous, expressing at the same time the full sense, and only the full sense of his original.", " How, then, had Hector his impending fate Eluded, had not Ph\u0153bus, at his last,235 Last effort meeting him, his strength restored, And wing\u2019d for flight his agile limbs anew? The son of Peleus, as he ran, his brows Shaking, forbad the people to dismiss A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand240 Piercing him, should usurp the foremost praise. But when the fourth time to those rivulets. They came, then lifting high his golden scales, Two lots the everlasting Father placed Within them, for Achilles one, and one245 For Hector, balancing the doom of both. Grasping it in the midst, he raised the beam. Down went the fatal day of Hector, down To Ades, and Apollo left his side. Then blue-eyed Pallas hasting to the son250 Of Peleus, in wing\u2019d accents him address\u2019d. Now, dear to Jove, Achilles famed in arms! I hope that, fierce in combat though he be, We shall, at last, slay Hector, and return Crown\u2019d with great glory to the fleet of Greece.255 No fear of his deliverance now remains, Not even should the King of radiant shafts, Apollo, toil in supplication, roll\u2019d 543 And roll\u2019d again[11] before the Thunderer\u2019s feet. But stand, recover breath; myself, the while,260 Shall urge him to oppose thee face to face. So Pallas spake, whom joyful he obey\u2019d, And on his spear brass-pointed lean\u2019d. But she, (Achilles left) to noble Hector pass\u2019d, And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned265 Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear In accents, as of pity, thus address\u2019d."], "What does Thetis want Achilles to do?": [" But enter, and accept Such welcome as to such a guest is due. So saying, she introduced and to a seat480 Led her with argent studs border\u2019d around And foot-stool\u2019d sumptuously;[8] then, calling forth Her spouse, the glorious artist, thus she said. Haste, Vulcan! Thetis wants thee; linger not. To whom the artist of the skies replied.485 A Goddess then, whom with much cause I love And venerate is here, who when I fell Saved me, what time my shameless mother sought To cast me, because lame, out of all sight; 465 Then had I been indeed forlorn, had not490 Eurynome the daughter of the Deep And Thetis in their laps received me fallen. Nine years with them residing, for their use I form\u2019d nice trinkets, clasps, rings, pipes, and chains, While loud around our hollow cavern roar\u2019d495 The surge of the vast deep, nor God nor man, Save Thetis and Eurynome, my life\u2019s Preservers, knew where I was kept conceal\u2019d. Since, therefore, she is come, I cannot less Than recompense to Thetis amber-hair\u2019d500 With readiness the boon of life preserved. Haste, then, and hospitably spread the board For her regale, while with my best dispatch I lay my bellows and my tools aside. He spake, and vast in bulk and hot with toil505 Rose limping from beside his anvil-stock Upborne, with pain on legs tortuous and weak. First, from the forge dislodged he thrust apart His bellows, and his tools collecting all Bestow\u2019d them, careful, in a silver chest,510 Then all around with a wet sponge he wiped His visage, and his arms and brawny neck Purified, and his shaggy breast from smutch; Last, putting on his vest, he took in hand His sturdy staff, and shuffled through the door.515 Beside the King of fire two golden forms Majestic moved, that served him in the place Of handmaids; young they seem\u2019d, and seem\u2019d alive, Nor want they intellect, or speech, or force, Or prompt dexterity by the Gods inspired.520 These his supporters were, and at his side Attendant diligent, while he, with gait Uncouth, approaching Thetis where she sat On a bright throne, seized fast her hand and said, Why, Thetis!", " To whom the awful Goddess ample-eyed.445 What word hath pass\u2019d thy lips, Jove, most severe? A man, though mortal merely, and to me Inferior in device, might have achieved That labor easily. Can I who boast Myself the chief of Goddesses, and such450 Not by birth only, but as thine espoused, Who art thyself sovereign of all the Gods, Can I with anger burn against the house Of Priam, and want means of just revenge? 464 Thus they in heaven their mutual conference455 Meantime, the silver-footed Thetis reach\u2019d The starr\u2019d abode eternal, brazen wall\u2019d Of Vulcan, by the builder lame himself Uprear\u2019d, a wonder even in eyes divine. She found him sweating, at his bellows huge460 Toiling industrious; tripods bright he form\u2019d Twenty at once, his palace-wall to grace Ranged in harmonious order. Under each Two golden wheels he set, on which (a sight Marvellous!) into council they should roll465 Self-moved, and to his house, self-moved, return. Thus far the work was finish\u2019d, but not yet Their ears of exquisite design affixt, For them he stood fashioning, and prepared The rivets. While he thus his matchless skill470 Employ\u2019d laborious, to his palace-gate The silver-footed Thetis now advanced, Whom Charis, Vulcan\u2019s well-attired spouse, Beholding from the palace portal, flew To seize the Goddess\u2019 hand, and thus inquired.475 Why, Thetis! worthy of all reverence And of all love, comest thou to our abode, Unfrequent here?", " But call ye Thetis hither, I would give The Goddess counsel, that, at Priam\u2019s hands100 Accepting gifts, Achilles loose the dead. He ceased. Then Iris tempest-wing\u2019d arose. Samos between, and Imbrus rock-begirt, She plunged into the gloomy flood; loud groan\u2019d The briny pool, while sudden down she rush\u2019d,105 As sinks the bull\u2019s[4] horn with its leaden weight, Death bearing to the raveners of the deep. Within her vaulted cave Thetis she found By every nymph of Ocean round about Encompass\u2019d; she, amid them all, the fate110 Wept of her noble son ordain\u2019d to death At fertile Troy, from Phthia far remote. Then, Iris, drawing near, her thus address\u2019d. Arise, O Thetis! Jove, the author dread Of everlasting counsels, calls for thee.115 To whom the Goddess of the silver feet. Why calls the mighty Thunderer me? I fear, Oppress\u2019d with countless sorrows as I am, To mingle with the Gods. Yet I obey\u2014 No word of his can prove an empty sound.120 So saying, the Goddess took her sable veil (Eye ne\u2019er beheld a darker) and began Her progress, by the storm-wing\u2019d Iris led. On either hand the billows open\u2019d wide A pass before them; they, ascending soon125 The shore, updarted swift into the skies. They found loud-voiced Saturnian Jove around Environ\u2019d by the ever-blessed Gods Convened in full assembly; she beside 593 Her Father Jove (Pallas retiring) sat.130 Then, Juno, with consolatory speech, Presented to her hand a golden cup, Of which she drank, then gave it back again, And thus the sire of Gods and men began.", " Goddess of ocean, Thetis! thou hast sought135 Olympus, bearing in thy bosom grief Never to be assuaged, as well I know. Yet shalt thou learn, afflicted as thou art, Why I have summon\u2019d thee. Nine days the Gods, Concerning Hector\u2019s body and thy own140 Brave city-spoiler son, have held dispute, And some have urged ofttimes the Argicide Keen-sighted Mercury, to steal the dead. But I forbade it for Achilles\u2019 sake, Whom I exalt, the better to insure145 Thy reverence and thy friendship evermore. Haste, therefore, seek thy son, and tell him thus, The Gods resent it, say (but most of all Myself am angry) that he still detains Amid his fleet, through fury of revenge,150 Unransom\u2019d Hector; so shall he, at length, Through fear of me, perchance, release the slain. Myself to generous Priam will, the while, Send Iris, who shall bid him to the fleet Of Greece, such ransom bearing as may soothe155 Achilles, for redemption of his son. So spake the God, nor Thetis not complied. Descending swift from the Olympian heights She reach\u2019d Achilles\u2019 tent. Him there she found Groaning disconsolate, while others ran160 To and fro, occupied around a sheep New-slaughter\u2019d, large, and of exuberant fleece. She, sitting close beside him, softly strok\u2019d His cheek, and thus, affectionate, began. How long, my son! sorrowing and mourning here,165 Wilt thou consume thy soul, nor give one thought Either to food or love?"], "What does Achilles do that frightens the Trojans?": [" Thrice o\u2019er the trench Achilles sent his voice Sonorous, and confusion at the sound Thrice seized the Trojans, and their famed allies.280 Twelve in that moment of their noblest died By their own spears and chariots, and with joy The Grecians from beneath a hill of darts Dragging Patroclus, placed him on his bier. Around him throng\u2019d his fellow-warriors bold,285 All weeping, after whom Achilles went Fast-weeping also at the doleful sight Of his true friend on his funereal bed Extended, gash\u2019d with many a mortal wound, Whom he had sent into the fight with steeds290 And chariot, but received him thence no more. And now majestic Juno sent the sun, Unwearied minister of light, although Reluctant, down into the Ocean stream. [5] So the sun sank, and the Achaians ceased295 From the all-wasting labors of the war. On the other side, the Trojans, from the fight Retiring, loosed their steeds, but ere they took Thought of refreshment, in full council met. It was a council at which no man sat,300 Or dared; all stood; such terror had on all Fallen, for that Achilles had appear\u2019d, After long pause from battle\u2019s arduous toil. First rose Polydamas the prudent son Of Panthus, above all the Trojans skill\u2019d305 Both in futurity and in the past. He was the friend of Hector, and one night 460 Gave birth to both. In council one excell\u2019d And one still more in feats of high renown. Thus then, admonishing them, he began.310 My friends!", " The interposing Furies at that word510 Suppress\u2019d his utterance,[12] and indignant, thus, Achilles, swiftest of the swift, replied. Why, Xanthus, propheciest thou my death? It ill beseems thee. I already know That from my parents far remote my doom515 Appoints me here to die; yet not the more Cease I from feats if arms, till Ilium\u2019s host Shall have received, at length, their fill of war. He said, and with a shout drove forth to battle. 491 THE ILIAD. BOOK XX. 492 ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTIETH BOOK. By permission of Jupiter the Gods descend into the battle, and range themselves on either side respectively. Neptune rescues \u00c6neas from death by the hand of Achilles, from whom Apollo, soon after, rescues Hector. Achilles slays many Trojans. 493 BOOK XX. The Grecians, thus, before their lofty ships Stood arm\u2019d around Achilles, glorious Chief Insatiable with war, and opposite The Trojans on the rising-ground appear\u2019d. [1] Meantime, Jove order\u2019d Themis, from the head5 Of the deep-fork\u2019d Olympian to convene The Gods in council. She to every part Proceeding, bade them to the courts of Jove. [2] Nor of the Floods was any absent thence Oceanus except, or of the Nymphs10 Who haunt the pleasant groves, or dwell beside Stream-feeding fountains, or in meadows green. Within the courts of cloud-assembler Jove Arrived, on pillar\u2019d thrones radiant they sat, With ingenuity divine contrived15 By Vulcan for the mighty Sire of all.", " But ancient Priam from a sacred tower Stood looking forth, whence soon he noticed vast Achilles, before whom the Trojans fled All courage lost. Descending from the tower620 With mournful cries and hasting to the wall He thus enjoin\u2019d the keepers of the gates. Hold wide the portals till the flying host Re-enter, for himself is nigh, himself Achilles drives them home. Now, wo to Troy!625 But soon as safe within the walls received They breathe again, shut fast the ponderous gates At once, lest that destroyer also pass. He said; they, shooting back the bars, threw wide The gates and saved the people, whom to aid630 Apollo also sprang into the field, They, parch\u2019d with drought and whiten\u2019d all with dust, Flew right toward the town, while, spear in hand, Achilles press\u2019d them, vengeance in his heart And all on fire for glory. Then, full sure,635 Ilium, the city of lofty gates, had fallen Won by the Grecians, had not Ph\u0153bus roused Antenor\u2019s valiant son, the noble Chief Agenor; him with dauntless might he fill\u2019d, And shielding him against the stroke of fate640 Beside him stood himself, by the broad beech Cover\u2019d and wrapt in clouds. Agenor then, Seeing the city-waster hero nigh 531 Achilles, stood, but standing, felt his mind Troubled with doubts; he groan\u2019d, and thus he mused.645 [10]Alas! if following the tumultuous flight Of these, I shun Achilles, swifter far He soon will lop my ignominious head.", " Ah son of Jove, God of the silver bow! 521 The mandate of the son of Saturn ill Hast thou perform\u2019d, who, earnest, bade thee aid275 The Trojans, till (the sun sunk in the West) Night\u2019s shadow dim should veil the fruitful field. He ended, and Achilles spear-renown\u2019d Plunged from the bank into the middle stream. Then, turbulent, the River all his tide280 Stirr\u2019d from the bottom, landward heaving off The numerous bodies that his current chok\u2019d Slain by Achilles; them, as with the roar Of bulls, he cast aground, but deep within His oozy gulfs the living safe conceal\u2019d.285 Terrible all around Achilles stood The curling wave, then, falling on his shield Dash\u2019d him, nor found his footsteps where to rest. An elm of massy trunk he seized and branch Luxuriant, but it fell torn from the root290 And drew the whole bank after it; immersed It damm\u2019d the current with its ample boughs, And join\u2019d as with a bridge the distant shores, Upsprang Achilles from the gulf and turn\u2019d His feet, now wing\u2019d for flight, into the plain295 Astonish\u2019d; but the God, not so appeased, Arose against him with a darker curl,[6] That he might quell him and deliver Troy. Back flew Achilles with a bound, the length Of a spear\u2019s cast, for such a spring he own\u2019d300 As bears the black-plumed eagle on her prey Strongest and swiftest of the fowls of air. Like her he sprang, and dreadful on his chest Clang\u2019d his bright armor."], "Why do the Trojans support Hector\u2019s foolish plan to make an assault on the Achaeans?": [" The Trojans first, with Hector at their head, Wedged in close phalanx, rush\u2019d to the assault As when within some rapid river\u2019s mouth320 The billows and stream clash, on either shore[3] Loud sounds the roar[3] of waves ejected wide, Such seem\u2019d the clamors of the Trojan host. But the Achaians, one in heart, around Patroclus stood, bulwark\u2019d with shields of brass325 And over all their glittering helmets Jove Darkness diffused, for he had loved Patroclus While yet he lived friend of \u00c6acides, And now, abhorring that the dogs of Troy Should eat him, urged the Greeks to his defence,330 The host of Troy first shook the Grecian host; The body left, they fled; yet of them all, The Trojan powers, determined as they were, Slew none, but dragg\u2019d the body. Neither stood The Greeks long time aloof, soon as repulsed335 Again led on by Ajax, who in form And in exploits all others far excell\u2019d. Peerless \u00c6acides alone except. Right through the foremost combatants he rush\u2019d, In force resembling most some savage boar340 That in the mountains bursting through the brakes, The swains disperses and their hounds with ease; Like him, illustrious Ajax, mighty son Of Telamon, at his assault dispersed With ease the close imbattled ranks who fought345 Around Patroclus\u2019 body, strong in hope To achieve it, and to make the glory theirs. Hippotho\u00fcs, a youth of high renown, Son of Pelasgian Lethus, by a noose Around his ancle cast dragg\u2019d through the fight350 433 Patroclus, so to gratify the host Of Ilium and their Chief; but evil him Reached suddenly, by none of all his friends (Though numerous wish\u2019d to save him) turn\u2019d aside.", " Shudder\u2019d the Trojans viewing at their feet The spotted serpent ominous, and thus Polydamas to dauntless Hector spake.260 Ofttimes in council, Hector, thou art wont To censure me, although advising well; Nor ought the private citizen, I confess, Either in council or in war to indulge Loquacity, but ever to employ265 All his exertions in support of thine. Yet hear my best opinion once again. Proceed we not in our attempt against The Grecian fleet. For if in truth the sign Respect the host of Troy ardent to pass,270 Then, as the eagle soar\u2019d both hosts between, With Ilium\u2019s on his left, and clutch\u2019d a snake Enormous, dripping blood, but still alive, Which yet he dropp\u2019d suddenly, ere he reach\u2019d His eyry, or could give it to his young,275 So we, although with mighty force we burst Both gates and barrier, and although the Greeks Should all retire, shall never yet the way Tread honorably back by which we came. No. Many a Trojan shall we leave behind280 Slain by the Grecians in their fleet\u2019s defence. An augur skill\u2019d in omens would expound This omen thus, and faith would win from all. To whom, dark-louring, Hector thus replied. Polydamas! I like not thy advice;285 Thou couldst have framed far better; but if this Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth, Who bidd\u2019st me disregard the Thunderer\u2019s[2] firm 301 Assurance to myself announced, and make290 The wild inhabitants of air my guides, Which I alike despise, speed they their course With right-hand flight toward the ruddy East, Or leftward down into the shades of eve.", " But noble Hector, soon as he beheld515 His brother Polydorus to the earth Inclined, and with his bowels in his hands, Sightless well-nigh with anguish could endure No longer to remain aloof; flame-like He burst abroad,[11] and shaking his sharp spear,520 508 Advanced to meet Achilles, whose approach Seeing, Achilles bounded with delight, And thus, exulting, to himself he said. Ah! he approaches, who hath stung my soul Deepest, the slayer of whom most I loved!525 Behold, we meet! Caution is at an end, And timid skulking in the walks of war. He ceased, and with a brow knit into frowns, Call\u2019d to illustrious Hector. Haste, approach, That I may quick dispatch thee to the shades.530 Whom answer\u2019d warlike Hector, nought appall\u2019d. Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy, With words to scare me. I have also taunts At my command, and can be sharp as thou. I know thee valiant, and myself I know535 Inferior far; yet, whether thou shalt slay Me, or, inferior as I am, be slain By me, is at the pleasure of the Gods, For I wield also not a pointless beam. He said, and, brandishing it, hurl\u2019d his spear,540 Which Pallas, breathing softly, wafted back From the renown\u2019d Achilles, and it fell Successless at illustrious Hector\u2019s feet. Then, all on fire to slay him, with a shout That rent the air Achilles rapid flew545 Toward him; but him wrapt in clouds opaque Apollo caught with ease divine away. Thrice, swift Achilles sprang to the assault Impetuous, thrice the pitchy cloud he smote, And at his fourth assault, godlike in act,550 And terrible in utterance, thus exclaim\u2019d.", " As the hounds, urged from behind By youthful hunters, on the wounded boar Make fierce assault; awhile at utmost speed They stretch toward him hungering, for the prey,880 But oft as, turning sudden, the stout brawn Faces them, scatter\u2019d on all sides escape; The Trojans so, thick thronging in the rear, 448 Ceaseless with falchions and spears double-edged Annoy\u2019d them sore, but oft as in retreat885 The dauntless heroes, the Ajaces turn\u2019d To face them, deadly wan grew every cheek, And not a Trojan dared with onset rude Molest them more in conflict for the dead. Thus they, laborious, forth from battle bore890 Patroclus to the fleet, tempestuous war Their steps attending, rapid as the flames Which, kindled suddenly, some city waste; Consumed amid the blaze house after house Sinks, and the wind, meantime, roars through the fire;895 So them a deafening tumult as they went Pursued, of horses and of men spear-arm\u2019d.

As a mound Planted with trees and stretch\u2019d athwart the mead Repels an overflow; the torrents loud905 Baffling, it sends them far away to float The level land, nor can they with the force Of all their waters burst a passage through; So the Ajaces, constant, in the rear Repress\u2019d the Trojans; but the Trojans them910 Attended still, of whom \u00c6neas most Troubled them, and the glorious Chief of Troy."], "What does Agamemnon give Achilles when he returns?": [" But if the relations of the murdered person were willing, the criminal, by paying a certain fine, might buy off the exile and remain at home. Ajax sums up this argument with great strength: We see, says he, a brother forgive the murder of his brother, a father that of his son; but Achilles will not forgive the injury offered him by taking away one captive woman. The character of Achilles is well sustained in all his speeches. To Ulysses he returns a flat denial, and threatens to leave the Trojan shore in the morning. To Ph\u0153nix his answer is more gentle. After Ajax has spoken, he seems determined not to depart, but yet refuses to bear arms, except in defence of his own squadron. Footnotes for Book X: With slight alteration, Homer here repeats the verses that open the 2d Book, and ascribes to Agamemnon the same watchfulness over men that Jupiter had over the gods. Menelaus starts a design, which is afterwards proposed by Nestor in council. The poet knew that the project would come with greater weight from the age of the one than from the youth of the other, and that the valiant would be ready to engage in the enterprise suggested by so venerable a counsellor. Agamemnon is uniformly represented as an example of brotherly affection, and at all times defends Menelaus.

His territory passes thine, And he is Lord of thousands more than thou. Cease, therefore, Agamemnon; calm thy wrath; And it shall be mine office to entreat355 Achilles also to a calm, whose might The chief munition is of all our host. To whom the sovereign of the Greeks replied, The son of Atreus. Thou hast spoken well, Old Chief, and wisely. But this wrangler here\u2014360 Nought will suffice him but the highest place: He must control us all, reign over all, Dictate to all; but he shall find at least One here, disposed to question his commands. If the eternal Gods have made him brave,365 Derives he thence a privilege to rail? Whom thus Achilles interrupted fierce. Could I be found so abject as to take The measure of my doings at thy lips, Well might they call me coward through the camp,370 A vassal, and a fellow of no worth. 016 Give law to others. Think not to control Me, subject to thy proud commands no more. Hear yet again! And weigh what thou shalt hear. I will not strive with thee in such a cause,375 Nor yet with any man; I scorn to fight For her, whom having given, ye take away.", " The Dream also repeats the words of Jupiter without variation, which is considered as a great propriety in delivering a message from the father of gods and men. King of Pylus, an ancient city of Elis. [Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him.\u2014Tr.] [Mercury.] [Argus.] Homer, in a happy and poetical manner, acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon, and traces the origin of his power to the highest source, by saying, that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter. The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army. According to the form of royalty in the heroic age, a king had only the power of a magistrate, except as he held the office of priest. Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war, a Judge of controversies, and President of the ceremonies of the gods. That he had the principal care of religious rites, appears from many passages in Homer. His power was nowhere absolute but in war, for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council, but in the army threatening deserters with death. Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings, as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege. [The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles.\u2014Tr.]", " To which may be added, that if the providence of heavenly powers to their creatures is expressed by the love of a mother to her child, if men in regard to them are but as sleeping infants, and the dangers that seem so great to us, as easily warded off as the simile implies, the conception appears sublime, however insignificant the image may at first seem in regard to a hero. From this we learn that the Lydians and Carians were famous for their skill in dying purple, and that their women excelled in works of ivory; and also that there were certain ornaments that only kings and princes were privileged to wear. This speech of Agamemnon over his wounded brother, is full of noble power and touching eloquence. The Trojans have violated a truce sanctioned by a solemn sacrifice to the gods. The reflection that such perjury cannot pass with impunity, but that Jove will, sooner or later, punish it, occurs first to the mind of the warrior. In the excitement of the moment, he predicts that the day will surely come when sacred Troy shall fall. From this impetuous feeling his mind suddenly returns to the condition of his brother, and imagines with much pathos, the consequences that will follow from his death, and ends with the wish, that the earth may open before him when that time shall come.\u2014Felton. The poet here changes the narration, and apostrophises the reader. Critics commend this figure, as the reader then becomes a spectator, and his mind is kept fixed on the action."], "Why does Achilles reprimand his horses?": [" This is one of the similes of Homer which illustrates the manners and customs of his age. The mode of preparing hides for use is particularly described. They were first softened with oil, and then were stretched every direction by the hands of men, so that the moisture might be removed and the oil might penetrate them. Considered in the single point of comparison intended, it gives a lively picture of the struggle on all sides to get possession of the body.\u2014Felton. This is the proper imperfect of the verb _chide_, though modern usage has substituted _chid_, a word of mean and awkward sound, in the place of it. This alludes to the custom of placing columns upon tombs, on which were frequently represented chariots with two or four horses. The horses standing still to mourn for their master, could not be more finely represented than by the dumb sorrow of images standing over a tomb. Perhaps the very posture in which these horses are described, their heads bowed down, and their manes falling in the dust, has an allusion to the attitude in which those statues on monuments were usually represented; there are bas-reliefs that favor this conjecture.

They went upon those parties with a few only, and generally the most daring of the army, and on occasions of the greatest hazard, when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle. Idomeneus, in the 13th book, tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service, each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it. In the earlier ages of the world, the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff, and thence had the name of sceptre. Ovid, in speaking of Jupiter, describes him as resting on his sceptre.\u2014Spence. From the description here given, it would appear to have been a young tree cut from the root and stripped of its branches. It was the custom of Kings to swear by their sceptres. For an account of the contest between the Centaurs and Lapiths here referred to, see Grecian and Roman Mythology. In _antiquity_, a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_, any sacrifice of a large number of victims. [The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.\u2014Tr.] The Iliad, in its connection, is, we all know, a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude, can alone conquer them. But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow, the Grecian sense of moderation forbids.", " The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame, and punish his insolence. That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus, a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend. The sea-goddess Thetis, who was, according to the Phthiotic mythus, wedded to the mortal Peleus, saved Zeus, by calling up the giant Briareus or \u00c6g\u00e6on to his rescue. Why it was \u00c6g\u00e6on, is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon, who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth, where even the sea-god himself was called \u00c6g\u00e6on; who, moreover, was worshipped at several places in Eub\u0153a, the seat of Poseidon \u00c6g\u00e6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon, and most of the genealogists, especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy, brought into relation with the sea. There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief, why Thetis called up \u00c6g\u00e6on of all others to Jove\u2019s assistance. The whole of the story, however, is not detailed\u2014it is not much more than indicated\u2014and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner. It bears the same relation to the Iliad, that the northern fables of the gods, which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen, bear to our German ballad, only that here the separation is much greater still\u2014Muller. Homer makes use of this fable, without reference to its meaning as an allegory.", " But seeing Hector in his ranks again Occupied, felt at once their courage fall\u2019n.345 Then, Thoas them, Andr\u00e6mon\u2019s son, address\u2019d, Foremost of the \u00c6tolians, at the spear Skilful, in stationary combat bold, And when the sons of Greece held in dispute The prize of eloquence, excell\u2019d by few.350 Prudent advising them, he thus began.

And just as often the heroes are protected by the gods who are worshipped by their own tribes and families\u2014Muller. This fiction of Homer, says Dacier, is founded upon an important truth of religion, not unknown to the Pagans: viz. that God only can open the eyes of men, and enable them to see what they cannot otherwise discover. The Old Testament furnishes examples. God opens the eyes of Hagar, that she may see the fountain. \u201cThe Lord opened the eyes of Baalam, and he saw the angel,\u201d etc. This power of sight was given to Diomede only for the present occasion.

The arrows of Apollo were \u201csilent as light,\u201d and their emblem the sun\u2019s rays. The analogies are multitudinous between the natural and intellectual sun; but Helios and Apollo were two.\u2014E.P.P. There is something exceedingly venerable in this appearance of the priest. He comes with the ensigns of the gods to whom he belongs, with the laurel wreath, to show that he was a suppliant, and a golden sceptre, which the ancients gave in particular to Apollo, as they did one of silver to Diana. The art of this speech is remarkable. Chryses considers the army of Greeks, as made up of troops, partly from the kingdoms and partly from democracies, and therefore begins with a distinction that includes all. Then, as priest of Apollo, he prays that they may obtain the two blessings they most desire\u2014the conquest of Troy and a safe return.", " Then, the cloud-Assembler God thus to Apollo spake. Hence, my Apollo! to the Trojan Chief275 Hector; for earth-encircler Neptune, awed By fear of my displeasure imminent, Hath sought the sacred Deep. Else, all the Gods Who compass Saturn in the nether realms, Had even there our contest heard, I ween,280 And heard it loudly. But that he retreats Although at first incensed, shunning my wrath, Is salutary both for him and me, Whose difference else had not been healed with ease. Take thou my shaggy \u00c6gis, and with force285 Smiting it, terrify the Chiefs of Greece. As for illustrious Hector, him I give To thy peculiar care; fail not to rouse His fiercest courage, till he push the Greeks To Hellespont, and to their ships again;290 Thenceforth to yield to their afflicted host Some pause from toil, shall be my own concern. He ended, nor Apollo disobey\u2019d His father\u2019s voice; from the Id\u00e6an heights, Swift as the swiftest of the fowls of air,295 The dove-destroyer falcon, down he flew. The noble Hector, valiant Priam\u2019s son He found, not now extended on the plain, But seated; newly, as from death, awaked, And conscious of his friends; freely he breathed300 Nor sweated more, by Jove himself revived. 370 Apollo stood beside him, and began. Say, Hector, Priam\u2019s son! why sittest here Feeble and spiritless, and from thy host Apart? what new disaster hath befall\u2019n?305 To whom with difficulty thus replied The warlike Chief.\u2014But tell me who art Thou, Divine inquirer!", " He said, and Men\u0153tiades the wrath Of shaft-arm\u2019d Ph\u0153bus shunning, far retired.865 But in the Sc\u00e6an gate Hector his steeds Detain\u2019d, uncertain whether thence to drive Amid the warring multitude again, Or, loud commandment issuing, to collect His host within the walls. Him musing long870 Apollo, clad in semblance of a Chief Youthful and valiant, join\u2019d. Asius he seem\u2019d Equestrian Hector\u2019s uncle, brother born Of Hecuba the queen, and Dymas\u2019 son, Who on the Sangar\u2019s banks in Phrygia dwelt.875 Apollo, so disguised, him thus bespake. Why, Hector, hast thou left the fight? this sloth Not well befits thee. Oh that I as far Thee pass\u2019d in force as thou transcendest me, Then, not unpunish\u2019d long, should\u2019st thou retire;880 But haste, and with thy coursers solid-hoof\u2019d Seek out Patroclus, him perchance to slay, Should Ph\u0153bus have decreed that glory thine. So saying, Apollo join\u2019d the host again. Then noble Hector bade his charioteer885 Valiant Cebriones his coursers lash Back into battle, while the God himself Entering the multitude confounded sore The Argives, victory conferring proud And glory on Hector and the host of Troy.890 But Hector, leaving all beside unslain, Furious impell\u2019d his coursers solid-hoof\u2019d Against Patroclus; on the other side Patroclus from his chariot to the ground Leap\u2019d ardent; in his left a spear he bore,895 And in his right a marble fragment rough, Large as his grasp.", " How, then, had Hector his impending fate Eluded, had not Ph\u0153bus, at his last,235 Last effort meeting him, his strength restored, And wing\u2019d for flight his agile limbs anew? The son of Peleus, as he ran, his brows Shaking, forbad the people to dismiss A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand240 Piercing him, should usurp the foremost praise. But when the fourth time to those rivulets. They came, then lifting high his golden scales, Two lots the everlasting Father placed Within them, for Achilles one, and one245 For Hector, balancing the doom of both. Grasping it in the midst, he raised the beam. Down went the fatal day of Hector, down To Ades, and Apollo left his side. Then blue-eyed Pallas hasting to the son250 Of Peleus, in wing\u2019d accents him address\u2019d. Now, dear to Jove, Achilles famed in arms! I hope that, fierce in combat though he be, We shall, at last, slay Hector, and return Crown\u2019d with great glory to the fleet of Greece.255 No fear of his deliverance now remains, Not even should the King of radiant shafts, Apollo, toil in supplication, roll\u2019d 543 And roll\u2019d again[11] before the Thunderer\u2019s feet. But stand, recover breath; myself, the while,260 Shall urge him to oppose thee face to face. So Pallas spake, whom joyful he obey\u2019d, And on his spear brass-pointed lean\u2019d. But she, (Achilles left) to noble Hector pass\u2019d, And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned265 Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear In accents, as of pity, thus address\u2019d."], "How does King Priam convince Achilles to spare Hector\u2019s body?": [" They from the yoke Released both steeds and mules, then introduced And placed the herald of the hoary King. They lighten\u2019d next the litter of its charge725 Inestimable, leaving yet behind Two mantles and a vest, that, not unveil\u2019d, The body might be borne back into Troy. Then, calling forth his women, them he bade Lave and anoint the body, but apart,730 Lest haply Priam, noticing his son, Through stress of grief should give resentment scope, And irritate by some affront himself To slay him, in despite of Jove\u2019s commands. [14] They, therefore, laving and anointing first735 The body, cover\u2019d it with cloak and vest; Then, Peleus\u2019 son disposed it on the bier, Lifting it from the ground, and his two friends Together heaved it to the royal wain. Achilles, last, groaning, his friend invoked.740 610 Patroclus! should the tidings reach thine ear, Although in Ades, that I have released The noble Hector at his father\u2019s suit, Resent it not; no sordid gifts have paid His ransom-price, which thou shalt also share.745 So saying, Achilles to his tent return\u2019d, And on the splendid couch whence he had risen Again reclined, opposite to the seat Of Priam, whom the hero thus bespake. Priam! at thy request thy son is loosed,750 And lying on his bier; at dawn of day Thou shalt both see him and convey him hence Thyself to Troy. But take we now repast; For even bright-hair\u2019d Niobe her food Forgat not, though of children twelve bereft,755 Of daughters six, and of six blooming sons.", " Oh ancient Priam! an immortal God Attends thee; I am Hermes, by command580 Of Jove my father thy appointed guide. But I return. I will not, entering here, Stand in Achilles\u2019 sight; immortal Powers May not so unreservedly indulge Creatures of mortal kind. But enter thou,585 Embrace his knees, and by his father both And by his Goddess mother sue to him, And by his son, that his whole heart may melt. So Hermes spake, and to the skies again Ascended. Then leap\u2019d Priam to the ground,590 Leaving Id\u00e6us; he, the mules and steeds Watch\u2019d, while the ancient King into the tent Proceeded of Achilles dear to Jove. Him there he found, and sitting found apart His fellow-warriors, of whom two alone595 Served at his side, Alcimus, branch of Mars And brave Automedon; he had himself Supp\u2019d newly, and the board stood unremoved. Unseen of all huge Priam enter\u2019d, stood Near to Achilles, clasp\u2019d his knees, and kiss\u2019d600 Those terrible and homicidal hands That had destroy\u2019d so many of his sons. As when a fugitive for blood the house Of some chief enters in a foreign land, All gaze, astonish\u2019d at the sudden guest,605 So gazed Achilles seeing Priam there, 606 And so stood all astonish\u2019d, each his eyes In silence fastening on his fellow\u2019s face. But Priam kneel\u2019d, and suppliant thus began. Think, oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods!610 On thy own father full of days like me, And trembling on the gloomy verge of life.", " Ah brother! thou art overtask\u2019d, around The walls of Troy by swift Achilles driven; But stand, that we may chase him in his turn. [12]270 To whom crest-tossing Hector huge replied. Deiphobus! of all my father\u2019s sons Brought forth by Hecuba, I ever loved Thee most, but more than ever love thee now, Who hast not fear\u2019d, seeing me, for my sake275 To quit the town, where others rest content. To whom the Goddess, thus, cerulean-eyed. Brother! our parents with much earnest suit Clasping my knees, and all my friends implored me To stay in Troy, (such fear hath seized on all)280 But grief for thee prey\u2019d on my inmost soul. Come\u2014fight we bravely\u2014spare we now our spears No longer; now for proof if Peleus\u2019 son Slaying us both, shall bear into the fleet Our arms gore-stain\u2019d, or perish slain by thee.285 So saying, the wily Goddess led the way. They soon, approaching each the other, stood Opposite, and huge Hector thus began. Pelides! I will fly thee now no more. Thrice I have compass\u2019d Priam\u2019s spacious walls290 A fugitive, and have not dared abide Thy onset, but my heart now bids me stand Dauntless, and I will slay, or will be slain. 544 But come. We will attest the Gods; for they Are fittest both to witness and to guard295 Our covenant. If Jove to me vouchsafe The hard-earn\u2019d victory, and to take thy life, I will not with dishonor foul insult Thy body, but, thine armor stripp\u2019d, will give Thee to thy friends, as thou shalt me to mine.300 To whom Achilles, lowering dark, replied.", " [12] Some neighbor chief, it may be, even now Oppresses him, and there is none at hand, No friend to suocor him in his distress.615 Yet, doubtless, hearing that Achilles lives, He still rejoices, hoping, day by day, That one day he shall see the face again Of his own son from distant Troy return\u2019d. But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons,620 So late the flower of Ilium, all are slain. When Greece came hither, I had fifty sons; Nineteen were children of one bed, the rest Born of my concubines. A numerous house! But fiery Mars hath thinn\u2019d it. One I had,625 One, more than all my sons the strength of Troy, Whom standing for his country thou hast slain\u2014 Hector\u2014his body to redeem I come Into Achaia\u2019s fleet, bringing, myself, Ransom inestimable to thy tent.630 Reverence the Gods, Achilles! recollect Thy father; for his sake compassion show To me more pitiable still, who draw Home to my lips (humiliation yet Unseen on earth) his hand who slew my son.635 So saying, he waken\u2019d in his soul regret Of his own sire; softly he placed his hand On Priam\u2019s hand, and push\u2019d him gently away. 607 Remembrance melted both. Rolling before Achilles\u2019 feet, Priam his son deplored640 Wide-slaughtering Hector, and Achilles wept By turns his father, and by turns his friend Patroclus; sounds of sorrow fill\u2019d the tent. But when, at length satiate, Achilles felt His heart from grief, and all his frame relieved,645 Upstarting from his seat, with pity moved Of Priam\u2019s silver locks and silver beard, He raised the ancient father by his hand, Whom in wing\u2019d accents kind he thus bespake."]}
