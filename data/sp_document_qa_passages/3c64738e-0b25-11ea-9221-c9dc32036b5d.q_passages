{"What is EdmondDant\u00e8s\u2019s profession at the beginning of the novel?": [" \u201cNever, sir,\u201d replied the jailer, \u201cnever; on the contrary, he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories. One day, too, when my wife was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.\u201d \u201cAh, ah!\u201d said the doctor, \u201cI did not know that I had a rival; but I hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect in consequence.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find. Will that satisfy you?\u201d \u201cMust this last formality take place in your presence, sir?\u201d inquired a turnkey. \u201cCertainly. But make haste\u2014I cannot stay here all day.\u201d Other footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached Dant\u00e8s\u2019 ears, the bed creaked, and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it. \u201cThis evening,\u201d said the governor. \u201cWill there be any mass?\u201d asked one of the attendants. \u201cThat is impossible,\u201d replied the governor. \u201cThe chaplain of the ch\u00e2teau came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence, in order to take a trip to Hy\u00e8res for a week. I told him I would attend to the prisoners in his absence. If the poor abb\u00e9 had not been in such a hurry, he might have had his requiem.\u201d \u201cPooh, pooh;\u201d said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his profession; \u201che is a churchman. God will respect his profession, and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.\u201d A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest.", " Nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in point.\u201d \u201c_Cedant arma tog\u00e6_,\u201d said Villefort with a bow. \u201cI cannot speak Latin,\u201d responded the marquise. \u201cWell,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e, \u201cI cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own\u2014a physician, for instance. Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a _destroying_ angel?\u201d \u201cDear, good Ren\u00e9e,\u201d whispered Villefort, as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker. \u201cLet us hope, my child,\u201d cried the marquis, \u201cthat M. de Villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province; if so, he will have achieved a noble work.\u201d \u201cAnd one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father\u2019s conduct,\u201d added the incorrigible marquise. \u201cMadame,\u201d replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, \u201cI have already had the honor to observe that my father has\u2014at least, I hope so\u2014abjured his past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and zealous friend to religion and order\u2014a better royalist, possibly, than his son; for he has to atone for past dereliction, while I have no other impulse than warm, decided preference and conviction.\u201d Having made this well-turned speech, Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory, much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court.", " Andrea assumed his gayest manner. \u201cYou know, my dear count,\u201d said he, \u201cthe ceremony is to take place this evening. At nine o\u2019clock the contract is to be signed at my father-in-law\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed?\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cWhat; is it news to you? Has not M. Danglars informed you of the ceremony?\u201d \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said the count; \u201cI received a letter from him yesterday, but I do not think the hour was mentioned.\u201d \u201cPossibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cyou are fortunate, M. Cavalcanti; it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting, and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed she is,\u201d replied Cavalcanti, in a very modest tone. \u201cAbove all, she is very rich,\u2014at least, I believe so,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cVery rich, do you think?\u201d replied the young man. \u201cDoubtless; it is said M. Danglars conceals at least half of his fortune.\u201d \u201cAnd he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions,\u201d said Andrea with a look sparkling with joy. \u201cWithout reckoning,\u201d added Monte Cristo, \u201cthat he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England, but quite novel in France.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I know what you mean,\u2014the railway, of which he has obtained the grant, is it not?\u201d \u201cPrecisely; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair.\u201d \u201cTen millions! Do you think so? It is magnificent!\u201d said Cavalcanti, who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words.", " At last, one day, when for the hundredth time I took up my spade, I asked myself again and again what the Corsican could have done with the child. A child encumbers a fugitive; perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it into the river.\u201d \u201cImpossible!\u201d cried Madame Danglars: \u201ca man may murder another out of revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.\u201d \u201cPerhaps,\u201d continued Villefort, \u201che had put it in the foundling hospital.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, yes,\u201d cried the baroness; \u201cmy child is there!\u201d \u201cI ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night\u2014the night of the 20th of September\u2014a child had been brought there, wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half. This portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron\u2019s crown, and the letter H.\u201d \u201cTruly, truly,\u201d said Madame Danglars, \u201call my linen is marked thus; Monsieur de Nargonne was a baron, and my name is Hermine. Thank God, my child was not then dead!\u201d \u201cNo, it was not dead.\u201d \u201cAnd you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy? Where is the child?\u201d Villefort shrugged his shoulders. \u201cDo I know?\u201d said he; \u201cand do you believe that if I knew I would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer? Alas, no, I know not. A woman, about six months after, came to claim it with the other half of the napkin. This woman gave all the requisite particulars, and it was intrusted to her.\u201d \u201cBut you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced her.\u201d \u201cAnd what do you think I did?"], "Who is the firstperson Dant\u00e8s visits when he reaches Marseilles?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested.", " what more do you want?\u201d \u201cI wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely free in my person?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cThen, as I said before, sir,\u2014very well; I am ready to marry M. Cavalcanti.\u201d \u201cBut what are you up to?\u201d \u201cAh, that is my affair. What advantage should I have over you, if knowing your secret I were to tell you mine?\u201d Danglars bit his lips. \u201cThen,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are ready to pay the official visits, which are absolutely indispensable?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Eug\u00e9nie. \u201cAnd to sign the contract in three days?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen, in my turn, I also say, very well!\u201d Danglars pressed his daughter\u2019s hand in his. But, extraordinary to relate, the father did not say, \u201cThank you, my child,\u201d nor did the daughter smile at her father. \u201cIs the conference ended?\u201d asked Eug\u00e9nie, rising. Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say. Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly\u2019s fingers, and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantio\u2019s malediction on Desdemona. At the end of the piece \u00c9tienne entered, and announced to Eug\u00e9nie that the horses were to the carriage, and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits.

The Contract Three days after the scene we have just described, namely towards five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eug\u00e9nie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti, whom the banker persisted in calling prince, a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristo\u2019s house, and the count was preparing to go out.", " Have you that means?\u201d \u201cIt is to be found for the searching. But why should I meddle in the matter? it is no affair of mine.\u201d \u201cI know not why you meddle,\u201d said Fernand, seizing his arm; \u201cbut this I know, you have some motive of personal hatred against Dant\u00e8s, for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.\u201d \u201cI! motives of hatred against Dant\u00e8s? None, on my word! I saw you were unhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; that\u2019s all; but since you believe I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get out of the affair as best you may;\u201d and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart. \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Fernand, restraining him, \u201cstay! It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dant\u00e8s. I hate him! I confess it openly. Do you find the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man, for Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s has declared she will kill herself if Dant\u00e8s is killed.\u201d Caderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said, \u201cKill Dant\u00e8s! who talks of killing Dant\u00e8s? I won\u2019t have him killed\u2014I won\u2019t! He\u2019s my friend, and this morning offered to share his money with me, as I shared mine with him.

Dant\u00e8s\u2019 eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed. That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey\u2019s visits. They had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his coming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees and with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria\u2019s or Dant\u00e8s\u2019 cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain. More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still continuing to instruct Dant\u00e8s by conversing with him, sometimes in one language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory."], "Which of the followingstatements is closest to the truth?": [" There was an impressive silence; Morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency. The count did not notice the introduction, in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the House; but at the mention of Yanina and Colonel Fernand, he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him. Moral wounds have this peculiarity,\u2014they may be hidden, but they never close; always painful, always ready to bleed when touched, they remain fresh and open in the heart. The article having been read during the painful hush that followed, a universal shudder pervaded the assembly, and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks. He stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case; it was the honor of M. de Morcerf, and that of the whole House, he proposed to defend, by provoking a debate on personal questions, which are always such painful themes of discussion. He concluded by calling for an investigation, which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread, and restore M. de Morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion. Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly.", " \u201cEnough, enough!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201csay no more about it; I will take all the consequences upon myself.\u201d And he began his story. Chapter 27. The Story First, sir,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cyou must make me a promise.\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d inquired the abb\u00e9. \u201cWhy, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you, that you will never let anyone know that it was I who supplied them; for the persons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to pieces like glass.\u201d \u201cMake yourself easy, my friend,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9. \u201cI am a priest, and confessions die in my breast. Recollect, our only desire is to carry out, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. Speak, then, without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; I do not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to speak; besides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to God, and not to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.\u201d This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage. \u201cWell, then, under these circumstances,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cI will, I even believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor Edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable.\u201d \u201cBegin with his father, if you please.\u201d said the abb\u00e9; \u201cEdmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love.\u201d \u201cThe history is a sad one, sir,\u201d said Caderousse, shaking his head; \u201cperhaps you know all the earlier part of it?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d answered the abb\u00e9; \u201cEdmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles.\u201d \u201cAt La R\u00e9serve!", " And when the jeweller Johannes had just paid you 45,000 francs for the diamond I had given you, and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both, was that also poverty?\u201d \u201cPardon, reverend sir,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cyou have saved my life once, save me again!\u201d \u201cThat is but poor encouragement.\u201d \u201cAre you alone, reverend sir, or have you there soldiers ready to seize me?\u201d \u201cI am alone,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, \u201cand I will again have pity on you, and will let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to, if you tell me the truth.\u201d \u201cAh, reverend sir,\u201d cried Caderousse, clasping his hands, and drawing nearer to Monte Cristo, \u201cI may indeed say you are my deliverer!\u201d \u201cYou mean to say you have been freed from confinement?\u201d \u201cYes, that is true, reverend sir.\u201d \u201cWho was your liberator?\u201d \u201cAn Englishman.\u201d \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d \u201cLord Wilmore.\u201d \u201cI know him; I shall know if you lie.\u201d \u201cAh, reverend sir, I tell you the simple truth.\u201d \u201cWas this Englishman protecting you?\u201d \u201cNo, not me, but a young Corsican, my companion.\u201d \u201cWhat was this young Corsican\u2019s name?\u201d \u201cBenedetto.\u201d \u201cIs that his Christian name?\u201d \u201cHe had no other; he was a foundling.\u201d \u201cThen this young man escaped with you?\u201d \u201cHe did.\u201d \u201cIn what way?\u201d \u201cWe were working at Saint-Mandrier, near Toulon. Do you know Saint-Mandrier?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cIn the hour of rest, between noon and one o\u2019clock\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cGalley-slaves having a nap after dinner!", " The box taken by Albert was in the first circle; although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic, and is, for this reason, generally styled the \u201cnobility\u2019s boxes,\u201d and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons, it had cost less than would be paid at some of the French theatres for one admitting merely four occupants. Another motive had influenced Albert\u2019s selection of his seat,\u2014who knew but that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair Roman, and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival? These united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been. Totally disregarding the business of the stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but, alas, this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity had been excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures, into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all so much engrossed with themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts, that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass. The truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the \u201cHoly Week\u201d that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage."], "What does Danglarswrite in his letter to the public prosecutor?": [" I, as a tender father\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended from you.\u201d \u201cWhom do you mean by they?\u201d \u201c_Ma foi_, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who wrote the letter; you received one, did you not?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cFrom whom?\u201d \u201cFrom a certain Abb\u00e9 Busoni.\u201d \u201cHave you any knowledge of him?\u201d \u201cNo, I have never seen him.\u201d \u201cWhat did he say in the letter?\u201d \u201cYou will promise not to betray me?\u201d \u201cRest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same.\u201d \u201cThen read for yourself;\u201d and the major gave a letter into the young man\u2019s hand.

Do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated?\u201d \u201cOh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my memory.\u201d \u201cRepeat it to me.\u201d Dant\u00e8s paused a moment, then said, \u201cThis is it, word for word: \u2018The king\u2019s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion, that one Edmond Dant\u00e8s, mate on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris.", " Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him, for the letter will be found upon him, or at his father\u2019s, or in his cabin on board the _Pharaon_.\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d resumed Danglars; \u201cnow your revenge looks like common sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as I am doing, and write upon it, \u2018To the king\u2019s attorney,\u2019 and that\u2019s all settled.\u201d And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke. \u201cYes, and that\u2019s all settled!\u201d exclaimed Caderousse, who, by a last effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail. \u201cYes, and that\u2019s all settled; only it will be an infamous shame;\u201d and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter. \u201cYes,\u201d said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; \u201cand as what I say and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and foremost, should be sorry if anything happened to Dant\u00e8s\u2014the worthy Dant\u00e8s\u2014look here!\u201d And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor. \u201cAll right!\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cDant\u00e8s is my friend, and I won\u2019t have him ill-used.\u201d \u201cAnd who thinks of using him ill? Certainly neither I nor Fernand,\u201d said Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner.", " And why were you alone?\u201d 40231m \u201cBecause you had been arrested, Edmond, and were a prisoner.\u201d \u201cAnd why was I arrested? Why was I a prisoner?\u201d \u201cI do not know,\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. \u201cYou do not, madame; at least, I hope not. But I will tell you. I was arrested and became a prisoner because, under the arbor of La R\u00e9serve, the day before I was to marry you, a man named Danglars wrote this letter, which the fisherman Fernand himself posted.\u201d Monte Cristo went to a secretaire, opened a drawer by a spring, from which he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue\u2014this he placed in the hands of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. It was Danglars\u2019 letter to the king\u2019s attorney, which the Count of Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson & French, had taken from the file against Edmond Dant\u00e8s, on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s read with terror the following lines: \u201cThe king\u2019s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dant\u00e8s, second in command on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dant\u00e8s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father\u2019s abode."], "Why does Villefortsentence Dant\u00e8s to life in prison?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested.", " \u201cHow should he have been otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.\u201d \u201cAnd for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.\u201d And here the look of the abb\u00e9, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse. \u201cA rich Englishman,\u201d continued the abb\u00e9, \u201cwho had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on Dant\u00e8s upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dant\u00e8s had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement. Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dant\u00e8s carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.\u201d \u201cThen, I suppose,\u201d asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, \u201cthat it was a stone of immense value?\u201d \u201cWhy, everything is relative,\u201d answered the abb\u00e9. \u201cTo one in Edmond\u2019s position the diamond certainly was of great value.", " One day, in a moment of despair like yours, since it led to a similar resolution, I also wished to kill myself; one day your father, equally desperate, wished to kill himself too. If anyone had said to your father, at the moment he raised the pistol to his head\u2014if anyone had told me, when in my prison I pushed back the food I had not tasted for three days\u2014if anyone had said to either of us then, \u2018Live\u2014the day will come when you will be happy, and will bless life!\u2019\u2014no matter whose voice had spoken, we should have heard him with the smile of doubt, or the anguish of incredulity,\u2014and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you\u2014how often have I myself\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the count, \u201cyou had only lost your liberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but I have lost Valentine.\u201d \u201cLook at me,\u201d said Monte Cristo, with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive\u2014\u201clook at me. There are no tears in my eyes, nor is there fever in my veins, yet I see you suffer\u2014you, Maximilian, whom I love as my own son. Well, does not this tell you that in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to beyond? Now, if I entreat, if I order you to live, Morrel, it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life.\u201d \u201cOh, heavens,\u201d said the young man, \u201coh, heavens\u2014what are you saying, count? Take care.", " The very madness of the Abb\u00e9 Faria, gone mad in prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity. The inspector kept his word with Dant\u00e8s; he examined the register, and found the following note concerning him: _Edmond Dant\u00e8s:_ Violent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba. The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised. This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it had been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend against this accusation; he simply wrote, _Nothing to be done._ This visit had infused new vigor into Dant\u00e8s; he had, till then, forgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the date, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose his reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months\u2014Dant\u00e8s still waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This fortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months passed away, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place, and Dant\u00e8s began to fancy the inspector\u2019s visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain. At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had obtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his subordinates, and amongst them Dant\u00e8s\u2019 jailer."], "How does Dant\u00e8sfigure out that he has been framed?": [" Alas, it is not the death of the body I regret; for is not the destruction of the vital principle, the repose to which everything is tending, to which every unhappy being aspires,\u2014is not this the repose of matter after which I so long sighed, and which I was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when Faria appeared in my dungeon? What is death for me? One step farther into rest,\u2014two, perhaps, into silence. No, it is not existence, then, that I regret, but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out, so laboriously framed. Providence is now opposed to them, when I most thought it would be propitious. It is not God\u2019s will that they should be accomplished. This burden, almost as heavy as a world, which I had raised, and I had thought to bear to the end, was too great for my strength, and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career. Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in Providence? \u201cAnd all this\u2014all this, because my heart, which I thought dead, was only sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again, because I have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman\u2019s voice. \u201cYet,\u201d continued the count, becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow, which Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s had accepted, \u201cyet, it is impossible that so noble-minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in the prime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love, or rather delirium."], "Why does everyonebelieve that Abb\u00e9 Faria is insane?": [" \u201cSteps approach\u2014I go\u2014adieu!\u201d And Dant\u00e8s, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend\u2019s mental instability, glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery. It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria\u2019s illness from the jailer, had come in person to see him. Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with pity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus separate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the case, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a slight indisposition. During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands, tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?", " Bonaparte\u2014\u2014\u201d M.

Sometimes he weeps bitterly, sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes \u2018duck-and-drake\u2019 five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had gained another Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity.\u201d \u201cOr of wisdom, my dear baron\u2014or of wisdom,\u201d said Louis XVIII., laughing; \u201cthe greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean\u2014see Plutarch\u2019s life of Scipio Africanus.\u201d M. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.", " \u201cIt is for that reason I am delighted to see you,\u201d continued the abb\u00e9, \u201calthough you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which, if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton\u2019s system. Could you allow me a few words in private.\u201d \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d said the governor. \u201cYou knew him,\u201d returned the inspector with a smile. \u201cWhat you ask is impossible, monsieur,\u201d continued he, addressing Faria. 0175m \u201cBut,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, \u201cI would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to five millions.\u201d \u201cThe very sum you named,\u201d whispered the inspector in his turn. \u201cHowever,\u201d continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was about to depart, \u201cit is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone; the governor can be present.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said the governor, \u201cI know beforehand what you are about to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?\u201d Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity. \u201cOf course,\u201d said he; \u201cof what else should I speak?\u201d \u201cMr. Inspector,\u201d continued the governor, \u201cI can tell you the story as well as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years.\u201d \u201cThat proves,\u201d returned the abb\u00e9, \u201cthat you are like those of Holy Writ, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not.\u201d \u201cMy dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures,\u201d replied the inspector; \u201ckeep them until you are liberated.\u201d The abb\u00e9\u2019s eyes glistened; he seized the inspector\u2019s hand.", " \u201cYou are the child of my captivity.

The abb\u00e9 did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dant\u00e8s knew it, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.

It is a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean.

Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who learns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually employed,\u2014Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dant\u00e8s, for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence. But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when Edmond returned to his cell. One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached him. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria\u2019s dungeon. \u201cAlas,\u201d murmured Edmond; \u201ccan it be?\u201d He moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open.", " I owe you my real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even C\u00e6sar Borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.\u201d Thus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied would be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dant\u00e8s to learn it by heart; and Dant\u00e8s knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed the second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dant\u00e8s,\u2014instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,\u2014the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second opening."], "How does Dant\u00e8sescape from prison?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong.

Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.\u201d \u201cAnd for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.\u201d And here the look of the abb\u00e9, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse. \u201cA rich Englishman,\u201d continued the abb\u00e9, \u201cwho had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on Dant\u00e8s upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dant\u00e8s had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement. Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dant\u00e8s carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.\u201d \u201cThen, I suppose,\u201d asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, \u201cthat it was a stone of immense value?\u201d \u201cWhy, everything is relative,\u201d answered the abb\u00e9. \u201cTo one in Edmond\u2019s position the diamond certainly was of great value.", " I will say and do nothing until I am convinced that he has quite abandoned me, and then\u2014\u2014\u201d Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever. The unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne with the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by degrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from being naked, dirty, and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector\u2019s voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt his heart leap with joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or the doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M. Bertuccio, who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars, the bolted doors, and the shadow which moved behind the other grating. \u201cAh,\u201d said Andrea, deeply affected. \u201cGood morning, Benedetto,\u201d said Bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice. \u201cYou\u2014you?\u201d said the young man, looking fearfully around him. \u201cDo you not recognize me, unhappy child?\u201d \u201cSilence,\u2014be silent!\u201d said Andrea, who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls; \u201cfor Heaven\u2019s sake, do not speak so loud!\u201d \u201cYou wish to speak with me alone, do you not?\u201d said Bertuccio.", " Remove from me the remains of doubt, which, if it change not to conviction, must become remorse!\u201d The count bowed his head, and clasped his hands together. \u201cHere, sir,\u201d said a voice behind him. Monte Cristo shuddered, and arose. The concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the Abb\u00e9 Faria had spread the riches of his mind. The manuscript was the great work by the Abb\u00e9 Faria upon the kingdoms of Italy. The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the epigraph, and he read: \u201cThou shalt tear out the dragons\u2019 teeth, and shall trample the lions under foot, saith the Lord.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201chere is my answer. Thanks, father, thanks.\u201d And feeling in his pocket, he took thence a small pocket-book, which contained ten bank-notes, each of 1,000 francs. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201ctake this pocket-book.\u201d \u201cDo you give it to me?\u201d \u201cYes; but only on condition that you will not open it till I am gone;\u201d and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found, which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel, he rushed out of the corridor, and reaching his boat, cried, \u201cTo Marseilles!\u201d Then, as he departed, he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison. \u201cWoe,\u201d he cried, \u201cto those who confined me in that wretched prison; and woe to those who forgot that I was there!\u201d 50229m As he repassed the Catalans, the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman."], "Where is theFaria\u2019s fortune hidden?": [" This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you, young and with a promising future,\u2014now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.\u201d Edmond turned away his head with a sigh. \u201cYou persist in your incredulity, Edmond,\u201d continued Faria. \u201cMy words have not convinced you.

Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier into a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the commissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that money he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his capital; and, having first married his banker\u2019s daughter, who left him a widower, he has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne, daughter of M. de Servieux, the king\u2019s chamberlain, who is in high favor at court. He is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron, and now he is the Baron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue du Mont-Blanc, with ten horses in his stables, six footmen in his antechamber, and I know not how many millions in his strongbox.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said the abb\u00e9, in a peculiar tone, \u201che is happy.\u201d \u201cHappy?

Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9, \u201cit was not of such a size as that; but you shall judge for yourself. I have it with me.\u201d The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest\u2019s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abb\u00e9 opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship. \u201cAnd that diamond,\u201d cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, \u201cyou say, is worth fifty thousand francs?\u201d \u201cIt is, without the setting, which is also valuable,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper. \u201cBut how comes the diamond in your possession, sir?

My first business will be to dispose of this diamond.\u201d So saying, the abb\u00e9 again drew the small box from his pocket, opened it, and contrived to hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of Caderousse. \u201cWife, wife!\u201d cried he in a hoarse voice, \u201ccome here!\u201d \u201cDiamond!\u201d exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step; \u201cwhat diamond are you talking about?\u201d \u201cWhy, did you not hear all we said?\u201d inquired Caderousse. \u201cIt is a beautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dant\u00e8s, to be sold, and the money divided between his father, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, his betrothed bride, Fernand, Danglars, and myself.

The abb\u00e9 took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond. \u201cOh, you are a man of God, sir,\u201d cried Caderousse; \u201cfor no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.\u201d \u201cWhich,\u201d said the abb\u00e9 to himself, \u201cyou would have done.\u201d The abb\u00e9 rose, took his hat and gloves. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201call you have told me is perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.\u201d \u201cSee, sir,\u201d replied Caderousse, \u201cin this corner is a crucifix in holy wood\u2014here on this shelf is my wife\u2019s testament; open this book, and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix.", " Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect. \u201cIt is a false diamond,\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cYou are joking now,\u201d replied Andrea. \u201cDo not be angry, we can try it.\u201d Caderousse went to the window, touched the glass with it, and found it would cut. \u201c_Confiteor!_\u201d said Caderousse, putting the diamond on his little finger; \u201cI was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller\u2019s shop\u2014it is another branch of industry paralyzed.\u201d \u201cHave you finished?\u201d said Andrea,\u2014\u201cdo you want anything more?\u2014will you have my waistcoat or my hat?

Albert kissed his mother\u2019s hand, and drew near the count. Another salver passed, loaded like the preceding ones; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count, but he obstinately refused. Albert rejoined his mother; she was very pale. \u201cWell,\u201d said she, \u201cyou see he refuses?\u201d \u201cYes; but why need this annoy you?\u201d \u201cYou know, Albert, women are singular creatures.

Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have his labor for his pains. And the thing was so much the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman, Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs. Alas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his way; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all faithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage over those of France, that they are faithful even in their infidelity."], "Why does ValentineVillefort not want to marry Franz d\u2019Epinay?": [" Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay, because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make, and, in short, because I choose to bestow my daughter\u2019s hand on whomever I please.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort had frequently solicited during this speech. \u201cWhat?

I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a dinner as you, I can scarcely stand.\u201d The young man shuddered at this strange familiarity. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said\u2014\u201ctell me what you want?\u201d \u201cWell, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry me back.\u201d Andrea turned pale, but said nothing. \u201cYes,\u201d said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking impudently at the youth; \u201cI have taken the whim into my head; do you understand, Master Benedetto?\u201d At this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went towards his groom, saying: \u201cThis man is right; I did indeed charge him with a commission, the result of which he must tell me; walk to the barrier, there take a cab, that you may not be too late.\u201d The surprised groom retired.", " I cannot account for it, but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars.\u201d 30107m \u201cAh,\u201d said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, \u201cthat may be easily explained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and refinement itself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth; that is natural enough.\u201d \u201cI do not know if that is her reason,\u201d said Albert, \u201cbut one thing I do know, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render her quite miserable. There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack of indisposition\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cReal?\u201d interrupted the count, smiling. \u201cOh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,\u2014at any rate they postponed the matter for two months. There is no hurry, you know. I am not yet twenty-one, and Eug\u00e9nie is only seventeen; but the two months expire next week. It must be done. My dear count, you cannot imagine how my mind is harassed. How happy you are in being exempt from all this!\u201d \u201cWell, and why should not you be free, too? What prevents you from being so?\u201d \u201cOh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not marry Mademoiselle Danglars.\u201d \u201cMarry her then,\u201d said the count, with a significant shrug of the shoulders. \u201cYes,\u201d replied Morcerf, \u201cbut that will plunge my mother into positive grief.\u201d \u201cThen do not marry her,\u201d said the count."], "What do Julieand Emmanuel prove to Dant\u00e8s?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested.", " Then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion; he arose, rushed out of the room and to the stairs, exclaiming energetically, \u201cJulie, Julie\u2014Emmanuel, Emmanuel!\u201d Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave, but Maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed upon the count. Julie, Emmanuel, and some of the servants, ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of Maximilian. Morrel seized their hands, and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs: \u201cOn your knees\u2014on your knees\u2014he is our benefactor\u2014the saviour of our father! He is\u2014\u2014\u201d He would have added \u201cEdmond Dant\u00e8s,\u201d but the count seized his arm and prevented him. Julie threw herself into the arms of the count; Emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel; Morrel again fell on his knees, and struck the ground with his forehead. Then the iron-hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes, he bent his head and wept. For a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs, while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven. Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room, descended to the next floor, ran into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the All\u00e9es de Meilhan. Meanwhile, Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count: \u201cOh, count, how could you, hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor, seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory,\u2014how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us?", " \u201cAnd you shall be alone,\u201d replied the young man. \u201cI will await you at the corner of the Rue du Mus\u00e9e, and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me!\u201d \u201cThen, Emmanuel?\u201d said the young girl with hesitation, \u201cit is your opinion that I should obey this invitation?\u201d \u201cYes. Did not the messenger say your father\u2019s safety depended upon it?\u201d \u201cBut what danger threatens him, then, Emmanuel?\u201d she asked. Emmanuel hesitated a moment, but his desire to make Julie decide immediately made him reply. \u201cListen,\u201d he said; \u201ctoday is the 5th of September, is it not?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cToday, then, at eleven o\u2019clock, your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay?\u201d \u201cYes, we know that.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d continued Emmanuel, \u201cwe have not fifteen thousand francs in the house.\u201d \u201cWhat will happen then?\u201d \u201cWhy, if today before eleven o\u2019clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid, he will be compelled at twelve o\u2019clock to declare himself a bankrupt.\u201d \u201cOh, come, then, come!\u201d cried she, hastening away with the young man. During this time, Madame Morrel had told her son everything. The young man knew quite well that, after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father, great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached such a point.", " Marseilles resounded with their well-earned praises. At last, one day, Emmanuel came to his wife, who had just finished making up the accounts. \u201c\u2018Julie,\u2019 said he to her, \u2018Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs; that completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains. Can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future? Listen to me. Our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year, from which we derive an income of 40,000 francs. We can dispose of the business, if we please, in an hour, for I have received a letter from M. Delaunay, in which he offers to purchase the good-will of the house, to unite with his own, for 300,000 francs. Advise me what I had better do.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Emmanuel,\u2019 returned my sister, \u2018the house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel. Is it not worth 300,000 francs to save our father\u2019s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure?\u2019 \u201c\u2018I thought so,\u2019 replied Emmanuel; \u2018but I wished to have your advice.\u2019 \u201c\u2018This is my counsel:\u2014Our accounts are made up and our bills paid; all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more, and close our office.\u2019 \u201cThis was done instantly. It was three o\u2019clock; at a quarter past, a merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was a clear profit of 15,000 francs. \u201c\u2018Monsieur,\u2019 said Emmanuel, \u2018have the goodness to address yourself to M. Delaunay."], "Whose greed doesDant\u00e8s exploit?": [" But nothing could be farther from his thoughts. \u201cFor a long time a gun had been the young man\u2019s greatest ambition. In every country where independence has taken the place of liberty, the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which at once renders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its owner terrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon; he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a mark\u2014the trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the Sabine mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion; the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon became so expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report, and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased, with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand. 20107m \u201cOne evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were usually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders, and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi considerable reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds admirers, go where he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the strongest, and the most courageous _contadino_ for ten leagues around; and although Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it was known that she was beloved by Vampa.", " Danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by Caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had recently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La R\u00e9serve. In fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _Pharaon_, who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship; and as Dant\u00e8s was universally beloved on board his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own. With the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste. Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them, composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on the bride, by whose side walked Dant\u00e8s\u2019 father; the whole brought up by Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile. Neither Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other.", " It seems\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cThat his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science, doubtless?\u201d \u201cNo; that his style of writing is very good.\u201d \u201cThis must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?\u201d Albert laughed. \u201cAnd the other one?\u201d demanded the count. \u201cThat one?\u201d \u201cYes, the third.\u201d \u201cThe one in the dark blue coat?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHe is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was very successful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal papers, but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him into favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an ambassador.\u201d 30303m \u201cAnd what are his claims to the peerage?\u201d \u201cHe has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five articles in the _Si\u00e8cle_, and voted five or six years on the ministerial side.\u201d \u201cBravo, viscount,\u201d said Monte Cristo, smiling; \u201cyou are a delightful _cicerone_. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cDo not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish it, you will warn me.\u201d Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He turned round; it was Danglars. \u201cAh! is it you, baron?\u201d said he. \u201cWhy do you call me baron?\u201d said Danglars; \u201cyou know that I care nothing for my title.", " And yet the two young people had never declared their affection; they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled, whose branches intertwined, and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens. Only their wish to see each other had become a necessity, and they would have preferred death to a day\u2019s separation. \u201cTeresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time, a band of brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to be much spoken of. The brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers. \u201cThe celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the kingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed the Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the Amasine between Sonnino and Juperno. He strove to collect a band of followers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom he hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and Pampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much disquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto. After some time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him. \u201cOne day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of Frosinone."], "Which of thefollowing people does not play a part in the revenge scheme againstVillefort?": [" Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, I must revenge myself, for I suffered fourteen years,\u2014fourteen years I wept, I cursed; now I tell you, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, I must revenge myself.\u201d The count, fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved, called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred. \u201cRevenge yourself, then, Edmond,\u201d cried the poor mother; \u201cbut let your vengeance fall on the culprits,\u2014on him, on me, but not on my son!\u201d \u201cIt is written in the good book,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cthat the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation.

Edmond, if you knew all the prayers I have addressed to God for you while I thought you were living and since I have thought you must be dead! Yes, dead, alas! I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower, or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers, and I wept! What could I do for you, Edmond, besides pray and weep? Listen; for ten years I dreamed each night the same dream. I had been told that you had endeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner; that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you had been thrown alive from the top of the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If, and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers.", " I guessed all; I followed him this evening to the Opera, and, concealed in a parquet box, have seen all.\u201d \u201cIf you have seen all, madame, you know that the son of Fernand has publicly insulted me,\u201d said Monte Cristo with awful calmness. \u201cOh, for pity\u2019s sake!\u201d \u201cYou have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel, one of my friends, had not stopped him.\u201d \u201cListen to me, my son has also guessed who you are,\u2014he attributes his father\u2019s misfortunes to you.\u201d \u201cMadame, you are mistaken, they are not misfortunes,\u2014it is a punishment.

I am king of all creation. I am pleased with one place, and stay there; I get tired of it, and leave it; I am free as a bird and have wings like one; my attendants obey my slightest wish. Sometimes I amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law. Then I have my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or appeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees.

Bathed in tears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times gazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her. Caderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married and eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dant\u00e8s, who was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon\u2019s downfall. Five months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the hour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s\u2019 arms.", " \u201cPoor Fernand has been dismissed,\u201d continued Caderousse. \u201cWell, and what then?\u201d said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger; \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not free to love whomsoever she will?\u201d \u201cOh, if you take it in that sense,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cit is another thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.\u201d Fernand smiled piteously. \u201cA lover is never terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cPoor fellow!\u201d remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart. \u201cWhy, you see, he did not expect to see Dant\u00e8s return so suddenly\u2014he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance faithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly.\u201d \u201cAh, _ma foi_, under any circumstances!\u201d said Caderousse, who drank as he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,\u2014\u201cunder any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dant\u00e8s; is he, Danglars?\u201d \u201cNo, you are right\u2014and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.\u201d \u201cWell, never mind,\u201d answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while Danglars had merely sipped his.", " Some days before the return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army, went to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general. \u201cFernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a captain in 1823, during the Spanish war\u2014that is to say, at the time when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.\u201d \u201cDestiny!"], "Why does Albertde Morcerf refuse to fight a duel with Dant\u00e8s?": [" Chapter 88.

Danglars?\u201d \u201cYes; M. Danglars is a money-lover, and those who love money, you know, think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel. The other is, on the contrary, to all appearance a true nobleman; but do you not fear to find him a bully?\u201d \u201cI only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight.\u201d \u201cDo not be alarmed,\u201d said Beauchamp; \u201che will meet you. My only fear is that he will be too strong for you.\u201d \u201cMy friend,\u201d said Morcerf, with a sweet smile, \u201cthat is what I wish. The happiest thing that could occur to me, would be to die in my father\u2019s stead; that would save us all.\u201d \u201cYour mother would die of grief.\u201d \u201cMy poor mother!\u201d said Albert, passing his hand across his eyes, \u201cI know she would; but better so than die of shame.\u201d \u201cAre you quite decided, Albert?\u201d \u201cYes; let us go.\u201d \u201cBut do you think we shall find the count at home?\u201d \u201cHe intended returning some hours after me, and doubtless he is now at home.\u201d They ordered the driver to take them to No. 30 Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.

Well, the French did not avenge themselves on the traitor, the Spaniards did not shoot the traitor, Ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished; but I, betrayed, sacrificed, buried, have risen from my tomb, by the grace of God, to punish that man.

Her forehead almost touched the carpet, when the count sprang forward and raised her. Then seated on a chair, she looked at the manly countenance of Monte Cristo, on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression. \u201cNot crush that accursed race?\u201d murmured he; \u201cabandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment?

Oh, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, I have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy, with the groan of sorrow, with the last effort of despair; I have uttered it when frozen with cold, crouched on the straw in my dungeon; I have uttered it, consumed with heat, rolling on the stone floor of my prison.", " 27.\u201d \u201cYou mistrust me, then,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s. Edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths. \u201cOh, I am a Christian,\u201d cried Dant\u00e8s, guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him. \u201cI swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I conjure you do not abandon me.

Another possessed all Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s\u2019 heart; that other was absent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old Dant\u00e8s incessantly said to her, \u2018Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would return to us.\u2019 \u201cThe old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned of the old man\u2019s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s; at the second he reminded her that he loved her. \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond.\u201d \u201cSo that,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, with a bitter smile, \u201cthat makes eighteen months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?\u201d Then he murmured the words of the English poet, \u201c\u2018Frailty, thy name is woman.\u2019\u201d \u201cSix months afterwards,\u201d continued Caderousse, \u201cthe marriage took place in the church of Accoules.\u201d \u201cThe very church in which she was to have married Edmond,\u201d murmured the priest; \u201cthere was only a change of bridegrooms.\u201d \u201cWell, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s was married,\u201d proceeded Caderousse; \u201cbut although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed La R\u00e9serve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had she looked to the bottom of her heart.", " \u201cWill you not even say you will see me again?\u201d he asked. \u201cOn the contrary, we shall meet again,\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, pointing to heaven with solemnity. \u201cI tell you so to prove to you that I still hope.\u201d And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s rushed up the stairs and disappeared. Monte Cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay. But Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s did not witness his departure, although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old Dant\u00e8s. Her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea; but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly: \u201cEdmond, Edmond, Edmond!\u201d Chapter 113. The Past The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation which had just taken place between Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them. A man of the count\u2019s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys superior ones. He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself."], "Why does Maximilianlong to kill himself?": [" \u201cNo, no,\u201d she vociferated, \u201cno, you cannot wish that!\u201d 50169m \u201cWhat I do not wish, madame, is that you should perish on the scaffold.

He left the room, and returned in five minutes with a phial. The dying man\u2019s eyes were all the time riveted on the door, through which he hoped succor would arrive. \u201cHasten, reverend sir, hasten! I shall faint again!\u201d Monte Cristo approached, and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial. Caderousse drew a deep breath. \u201cOh,\u201d said he, \u201cthat is life to me; more, more!\u201d \u201cTwo drops more would kill you,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9. \u201cOh, send for someone to whom I can denounce the wretch!\u201d \u201cShall I write your deposition? You can sign it.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge. Monte Cristo wrote: \u201cI die, murdered by the Corsican Benedetto, my comrade in the galleys at Toulon, No. 59.\u201d \u201cQuick, quick!\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cor I shall be unable to sign it.\u201d Monte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse, who collected all his strength, signed it, and fell back on his bed, saying: \u201cYou will relate all the rest, reverend sir; you will say he calls himself Andrea Cavalcanti.", " Have you that means?\u201d \u201cIt is to be found for the searching.

And why, when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed, might he not also be? Oh, yes; certainly a speedy, violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies, who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance. But to die? For the first time in his life, Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire; the time had come when the implacable spectre, which exists in the mind of every human creature, arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart, \u201cThou shalt die!\u201d Danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase; first it flies, then despairs, and at last, by the very force of desperation, sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers."], "Why does Dant\u00e8sallow Maximilian to believe that Valentine is dead?": [" \u201cBarrois,\u201d said Valentine, \u201cshut the door, and let no one come in.\u201d She passed first. Noirtier, seated in his chair, and listening to every sound, was watching the door; he saw Valentine, and his eye brightened. There was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man, and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate. \u201cDear grandfather.\u201d said she hurriedly, \u201cyou know poor grandmamma died an hour since, and now I have no friend in the world but you.\u201d His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness. \u201cTo you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?\u201d The paralytic motioned \u201cYes.\u201d Valentine took Maximilian\u2019s hand. \u201cLook attentively, then, at this gentleman.\u201d The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Morrel. \u201cIt is M. Maximilian Morrel,\u201d said she; \u201cthe son of that good merchant of Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the old man. \u201cHe brings an irreproachable name, which Maximilian is likely to render glorious, since at thirty years of age he is a captain, an officer of the Legion of Honor.\u201d The old man signified that he recollected him. \u201cWell, grandpapa,\u201d said Valentine, kneeling before him, and pointing to Maximilian, \u201cI love him, and will be only his; were I compelled to marry another, I would destroy myself.\u201d The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts. \u201cYou like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?\u201d asked Valentine.", " \u201cNow,\u201d said Valentine, motioning to Morrel to sit down near her grandfather, while she took her seat on his footstool,\u2014\u201cnow let us talk about our own affairs. You know, Maximilian, grandpapa once thought of leaving this house, and taking an apartment away from M. de Villefort\u2019s.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Maximilian, \u201cI recollect the project, of which I highly approved.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Valentine, \u201cyou may approve again, for grandpapa is again thinking of it.\u201d \u201cBravo,\u201d said Maximilian. 40272m \u201cAnd do you know,\u201d said Valentine, \u201cwhat reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house.\u201d Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence, but she did not notice him; her looks, her eyes, her smile, were all for Morrel. \u201cOh, whatever may be M. Noirtier\u2019s reason,\u201d answered Morrel, \u201cI can readily believe it to be a good one.\u201d \u201cAn excellent one,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cHe pretends the air of the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 is not good for me.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Morrel; \u201cin that M. Noirtier may be right; you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight.\u201d \u201cNot very,\u201d said Valentine. \u201cAnd grandpapa has become my physician, and I have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything.\u201d \u201cDo you then really suffer?\u201d asked Morrel quickly. \u201cOh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness, that is all. I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something.\u201d Noirtier did not lose a word of what Valentine said.", " A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common, every-day sort of attachment such as ours. But they are calling me. Do you hear?\u201d \u201cAh, Valentine,\u201d said Maximilian, \u201cgive me but one finger through this opening in the grating, one finger, the littlest finger of all, that I may have the happiness of kissing it.\u201d \u201cMaximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two shadows.\u201d \u201cAs you will, Valentine.\u201d \u201cShall you be happy if I do what you wish?\u201d \u201cOh, yes!\u201d Valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening. Maximilian uttered a cry of delight, and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him, and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. The little hand was then immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw Valentine hurrying towards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations. Chapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort We will now relate what was passing in the house of the king\u2019s attorney after the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the time of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we have just detailed. M. de Villefort entered his father\u2019s room, followed by Madame de Villefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man and speaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five years in his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.", " The young man, with the intuitive perception of a lover, quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed, and he was comforted. Besides, although she avoided coming within speaking distance, Valentine arranged so that Maximilian could see her pass and repass, and each time she went by, she managed, unperceived by her companion, to cast an expressive look at the young man, which seemed to say, \u201cHave patience! You see it is not my fault.\u201d And Maximilian was patient, and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls,\u2014one fair, with soft languishing eyes, a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow; the other a brunette, with a fierce and haughty expression, and as straight as a poplar. It is unnecessary to state that, in the eyes of the young man, Valentine did not suffer by the contrast. In about half an hour the girls went away, and Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars\u2019 visit had at last come to an end. In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the garden alone. For fear that anyone should be observing her return, she walked slowly; and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate, she seated herself on a bench, and, carefully casting her eyes around, to convince herself that she was not watched, she presently arose, and proceeded quickly to join Maximilian. \u201cGood-evening, Valentine,\u201d said a well-known voice. \u201cGood-evening, Maximilian; I know I have kept you waiting, but you saw the cause of my delay.\u201d \u201cYes, I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars."], "How does Dant\u00e8slearn to feel normal human emotions again?": [" \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cBecause he is an actor in the drama.\u201d \u201cHas he assassinated anyone, then?\u201d \u201cNo, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. You know that it was in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his friend Benedetto. You know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage-contract. Do you see the waistcoat? There it is, all blood-stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime.\u201d \u201cAh, very good.\u201d \u201cHush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.\u201d A noise was heard in the hall; the sergeant called his two patrons with an energetic \u201chem!\u201d and the door-keeper appearing, called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order, ever since the days of Beaumarchais: \u201cThe court, gentlemen!\u201d Chapter 110. The Indictment The judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence; the jury took their seats; M. de Villefort, the object of unusual attention, and we had almost said of general admiration, sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him. Everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face, whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb, and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror. \u201cGendarmes,\u201d said the president, \u201clead in the accused.\u201d At these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes were turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter.", " Villefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head, muttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the carriage, ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-M\u00e9ran\u2019s. The hapless Dant\u00e8s was doomed. As the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Ren\u00e9e in waiting. He started when he saw Ren\u00e9e, for he fancied she was again about to plead for Dant\u00e8s. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she was thinking only of Villefort\u2019s departure. She loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and Ren\u00e9e, far from pleading for Dant\u00e8s, hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover. 0127m Meanwhile what of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s? She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue de la Loge; she had returned to the Catalans, and had despairingly cast herself on her couch. Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her hand, and covered it with kisses that Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s did not even feel. She passed the night thus. The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid no heed to the darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was day. Grief had made her blind to all but one object\u2014that was Edmond.", " \u201cWhere do you suffer?\u201d asked the doctor. \u201cEverywhere. I feel cramps over my whole body.\u201d \u201cDo you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAny noise in the ears?\u201d \u201cFrightful.\u201d 40112m \u201cWhen did you first feel that?\u201d \u201cJust now.\u201d \u201cSuddenly?\u201d \u201cYes, like a clap of thunder.\u201d \u201cDid you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?\u201d \u201cNothing.\u201d \u201cNo drowsiness?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d \u201cWhat have you eaten today?\u201d \u201cI have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master\u2019s lemonade\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d And Barrois turned towards Noirtier, who, immovably fixed in his armchair, was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him. \u201cWhere is this lemonade?\u201d asked the doctor eagerly. \u201cDownstairs in the decanter.\u201d \u201cWhereabouts downstairs?\u201d \u201cIn the kitchen.\u201d \u201cShall I go and fetch it, doctor?\u201d inquired Villefort. \u201cNo, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water. I will go myself and fetch the lemonade.\u201d D\u2019Avrigny bounded towards the door, flew down the back staircase, and almost knocked down Madame de Villefort, in his haste, who was herself going down to the kitchen. She cried out, but d\u2019Avrigny paid no attention to her; possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four steps with a bound, and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter, where it had been left. He darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey.", " \u201cNow,\u201d said Morrel, \u201cdo you wish me to retire?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWithout seeing Mademoiselle Valentine?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey. \u201cBut,\u201d said he, \u201cfirst allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now.\u201d Noirtier\u2019s expression could not be understood. The young man pressed his lips on the same spot, on the old man\u2019s forehead, where Valentine\u2019s had been. Then he bowed a second time and retired. He found outside the door the old servant, to whom Valentine had given directions. Morrel was conducted along a dark passage, which led to a little door opening on the garden, soon found the spot where he had entered, with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall, and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover-field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him. He got in it, and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions, arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay, threw himself on his bed and slept soundly. VOLUME FOUR 40010m 40012m 40020m Chapter 74. The Villefort Family Vault Two days after, a considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o\u2019clock in the morning, around the door of M. de Villefort\u2019s house, and a long file of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 and the Rue de la P\u00e9pini\u00e8re. Among them was one of a very singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance. It was a kind of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first to arrive."], "How old is Edmond Dant\u00e8s at the start of the novel?": [" Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. \u201cThen you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.\u201d \u201cWhat, did you refuse to dine with him?\u201d said old Dant\u00e8s; \u201cand did he invite you to dine?\u201d \u201cYes, my dear father,\u201d replied Edmond, smiling at his father\u2019s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son. \u201cAnd why did you refuse, my son?\u201d inquired the old man. \u201cThat I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,\u201d replied the young man. \u201cI was most anxious to see you.\u201d \u201cBut it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cAnd when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy the owner.\u201d \u201cBut I explained to him the cause of my refusal,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand I hope he fully understood it.\u201d \u201cYes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one\u2019s patrons.\u201d \u201cI hope to be captain without that,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s. \u201cSo much the better\u2014so much the better! Nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the Saint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.\u201d \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s?\u201d said the old man. \u201cYes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you, and know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the Catalans.\u201d \u201cGo, my dear boy,\u201d said old Dant\u00e8s; \u201cand Heaven bless you in your wife, as it has blessed me in my son!\u201d \u201cHis wife!\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cwhy, how fast you go on, father Dant\u00e8s; she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.\u201d \u201cNo, but according to all probability she soon will be,\u201d replied Edmond.", " I always knew you were a good son.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d inquired Dant\u00e8s, with some hesitation, \u201cdo you know how my father is?\u201d \u201cWell, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.\u201d \u201cYes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.\u201d \u201cThat proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.\u201d Dant\u00e8s smiled. \u201cMy father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.\u201d \u201cWell, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.\u201d \u201cI must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.\u201d \u201cTrue, Dant\u00e8s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father\u2014the lovely Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.\u201d Dant\u00e8s blushed. \u201cAh, ha,\u201d said the shipowner, \u201cI am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!\u201d \u201cShe is not my mistress,\u201d replied the young sailor, gravely; \u201cshe is my betrothed.\u201d \u201cSometimes one and the same thing,\u201d said Morrel, with a smile. \u201cNot with us, sir,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWell, well, my dear Edmond,\u201d continued the owner, \u201cdon\u2019t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?\u201d \u201cNo, sir; I have all my pay to take\u2014nearly three months\u2019 wages.\u201d \u201cYou are a careful fellow, Edmond.\u201d \u201cSay I have a poor father, sir.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father.", " \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested.", " Well, Edmond, I swear to you, by the head of that son for whom I entreat your pity,\u2014Edmond, for ten years I saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy, and for ten years I heard every night the cry which awoke me, shuddering and cold. And I, too, Edmond\u2014oh! believe me\u2014guilty as I was\u2014oh, yes, I, too, have suffered much!\u201d \u201cHave you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence?\u201d cried Monte Cristo, thrusting his hands into his hair; \u201chave you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival, while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d interrupted Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, \u201cbut I have seen him whom I loved on the point of murdering my son.\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s uttered these words with such deep anguish, with an accent of such intense despair, that Monte Cristo could not restrain a sob. The lion was daunted; the avenger was conquered. \u201cWhat do you ask of me?\u201d said he,\u2014\u201cyour son\u2019s life? Well, he shall live!\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte Cristo\u2019s eyes; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously, for, doubtless, God had sent some angel to collect them\u2014far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of Guzerat and Ophir. \u201cOh,\u201d said she, seizing the count\u2019s hand and raising it to her lips; \u201coh, thank you, thank you, Edmond! Now you are exactly what I dreamt you were,\u2014the man I always loved. Oh, now I may say so!\u201d \u201cSo much the better,\u201d replied Monte Cristo; \u201cas that poor Edmond will not have long to be loved by you."], "What do Dant\u00e8s\u2019 friends conspire to accuse him of?": [" Dant\u00e8s spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice; he had tried to speak when alone, but the sound of his voice terrified him. Often, before his captivity, Dant\u00e8s\u2019 mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers. He now wished to be amongst them, in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the infamous costume, the chain, and the brand on the shoulder. The galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other. They were very happy. He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were it even the mad abb\u00e9. The jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently imagined that Dant\u00e8s wished to conspire or attempt an escape, and refused his request. Dant\u00e8s had exhausted all human resources, and he then turned to God. All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new meaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven!", " \u201cSir,\u201d said Beauchamp, who had not yet spoken, \u201cyou appear to accuse the count, who is absent from Paris at this moment, and cannot justify himself.\u201d \u201cI accuse no one, sir,\u201d said Danglars; \u201cI relate, and I will repeat before the count what I have said to you.\u201d \u201cDoes the count know what answer you received?\u201d \u201cYes; I showed it to him.\u201d \u201cDid he know my father\u2019s Christian name was Fernand, and his family name Mondego?\u201d \u201cYes, I had told him that long since, and I did only what any other would have done in my circumstances, and perhaps less. When, the day after the arrival of this answer, your father came by the advice of Monte Cristo to ask my daughter\u2019s hand for you, I decidedly refused him, but without any explanation or exposure. In short, why should I have any more to do with the affair? How did the honor or disgrace of M. de Morcerf affect me? It neither increased nor decreased my income.\u201d Albert felt the blood mounting to his brow; there was no doubt upon the subject. Danglars defended himself with the baseness, but at the same time with the assurance, of a man who speaks the truth, at least in part, if not wholly\u2014not for conscience\u2019 sake, but through fear. Besides, what was Morcerf seeking? It was not whether Danglars or Monte Cristo was more or less guilty; it was a man who would answer for the offence, whether trifling or serious; it was a man who would fight, and it was evident Danglars would not fight.", " It was a mistake.\u201d \u201cYes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a sleepless night, which has caused the minister\u2019s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.\u201d \u201cBut, sir,\u201d said Hermine suddenly, \u201cif all this is, as you say, caused by M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell me of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?\u201d \u201cDo I know M. Debray?\u2014do I wish to know him?\u2014do I wish to know that he gives advice?\u2014do I wish to follow it?\u2014do I speculate? No; you do all this, not I.\u201d \u201cStill it seems to me, that as you profit by it\u2014\u2014\u201d Danglars shrugged his shoulders. \u201cFoolish creature,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWomen fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of Paris! But know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the commencement of the art\u2014for generally husbands _will_ not see\u2014you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world. But it has not been so with me,\u2014I see, and always have seen, during the last sixteen years. You may, perhaps, have hidden a thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped me, while you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed you had deceived me. What has been the result?\u2014that, thanks to my pretended ignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort to M.

Monte Cristo was not deceived. As soon as he appeared in the Count of Morcerf\u2019s antechamber, a footman, the same who at Rome had brought the count\u2019s card to the two young men, and announced his visit, sprang into the vestibule, and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him.

I will not forget you. Wait.\u201d \u201cHow long?\u201d \u201cI must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.\u201d \u201cBut you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me come to you.

He drew back terrified. As for Monte Cristo, after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light. In a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided, as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun\u2019s genial influence when the cloud has passed. This silence, self-control, and struggle lasted about twenty seconds, then the count raised his pallid face. \u201cSee,\u201d said he, \u201cmy dear friend, how God punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference, by presenting dreadful scenes to their view.", " In the morning, I shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming, and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have enjoyed in your presence; then too, when alone, I can call forth mighty pictures of the past, see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of Pindus and Olympus. Oh, believe me, that when three great passions, such as sorrow, love, and gratitude fill the heart, _ennui_ can find no place.\u201d \u201cYou are a worthy daughter of Epirus, Hayd\u00e9e, and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace.

The love I have for you is very different from the love I had for my father. My father died, but I did not die. If you were to die, I should die too.\u201d The count, with a smile of profound tenderness, extended his hand, and she carried it to her lips. Monte Cristo, thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with Morrel and his family, departed, murmuring as he went these lines of Pindar, \u201cYouth is a flower of which love is the fruit; happy is he who, after having watched its silent growth, is permitted to gather and call it his own.\u201d The carriage was prepared according to orders, and stepping lightly into it, the count drove off at his usual rapid pace.", " Have you that means?\u201d \u201cIt is to be found for the searching.

Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.\u201d \u201cTrue, Dant\u00e8s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father\u2014the lovely Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.\u201d Dant\u00e8s blushed. \u201cAh, ha,\u201d said the shipowner, \u201cI am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!\u201d \u201cShe is not my mistress,\u201d replied the young sailor, gravely; \u201cshe is my betrothed.\u201d \u201cSometimes one and the same thing,\u201d said Morrel, with a smile. \u201cNot with us, sir,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWell, well, my dear Edmond,\u201d continued the owner, \u201cdon\u2019t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?\u201d \u201cNo, sir; I have all my pay to take\u2014nearly three months\u2019 wages.\u201d \u201cYou are a careful fellow, Edmond.\u201d \u201cSay I have a poor father, sir.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father.", " And why were you alone?\u201d 40231m \u201cBecause you had been arrested, Edmond, and were a prisoner.\u201d \u201cAnd why was I arrested? Why was I a prisoner?\u201d \u201cI do not know,\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. \u201cYou do not, madame; at least, I hope not. But I will tell you. I was arrested and became a prisoner because, under the arbor of La R\u00e9serve, the day before I was to marry you, a man named Danglars wrote this letter, which the fisherman Fernand himself posted.\u201d Monte Cristo went to a secretaire, opened a drawer by a spring, from which he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue\u2014this he placed in the hands of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. It was Danglars\u2019 letter to the king\u2019s attorney, which the Count of Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson & French, had taken from the file against Edmond Dant\u00e8s, on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s read with terror the following lines: \u201cThe king\u2019s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dant\u00e8s, second in command on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dant\u00e8s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father\u2019s abode.", " No, there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness! But we must say farewell, Edmond, and let us part.\u201d \u201cBefore I leave you, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, have you no request to make?\u201d said the count. \u201cI desire but one thing in this world, Edmond,\u2014the happiness of my son.\u201d \u201cPray to the Almighty to spare his life, and I will take upon myself to promote his happiness.\u201d \u201cThank you, Edmond.\u201d \u201cBut have you no request to make for yourself, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s?\u201d \u201cFor myself I want nothing. I live, as it were, between two graves. One is that of Edmond Dant\u00e8s, lost to me long, long since. He had my love! That word ill becomes my faded lip now, but it is a memory dear to my heart, and one that I would not lose for all that the world contains. The other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of Edmond Dant\u00e8s. I approve of the deed, but I must pray for the dead.\u201d \u201cYour son shall be happy, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s,\u201d repeated the count. \u201cThen I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer.\u201d \u201cBut what are your intentions?\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s smiled sadly. \u201cTo say that I shall live here, like the Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s of other times, gaining my bread by labor, would not be true, nor would you believe me. I have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer. However, I shall have no occasion to work, for the little sum of money buried by you, and which I found in the place you mentioned, will be sufficient to maintain me."], "Who is the ambitious public prosecutor that sentences Dant\u00e8s to life in prison?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s.

Morrel, \u201chere is the _Pharaon_ without a captain.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d replied Danglars, \u201csince we cannot leave this port for the next three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dant\u00e8s will be set at liberty.\u201d \u201cNo doubt; but in the meantime?\u201d \u201cI am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,\u201d answered Danglars. \u201cYou know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services, that upon Edmond\u2019s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the _Pharaon_ than for Dant\u00e8s and myself each to resume our respective posts.\u201d \u201cThanks, Danglars\u2014that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the _Pharaon_, and look carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business.\u201d \u201cBe easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond?\u201d \u201cI will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmond\u2019s favor. I am aware he is a furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king\u2019s attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.\u201d \u201cPerhaps not,\u201d replied Danglars; \u201cbut I hear that he is ambitious, and that\u2019s rather against him.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d returned M. Morrel, \u201cwe shall see.", " \u201cMy political opinions!\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. \u201cAlas, sir, I never had any opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play. If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus all my opinions\u2014I will not say public, but private\u2014are confined to these three sentiments,\u2014I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I adore Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how uninteresting it is.\u201d As Dant\u00e8s spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of Ren\u00e9e, who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With the deputy\u2019s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he was scarcely a man,\u2014simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody, because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked good\u2014extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort\u2019s severe look and stern accent. Dant\u00e8s seemed full of kindness. _\u201cPardieu!\u201d_ said Villefort, \u201che is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain Ren\u00e9e\u2019s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.\u201d Full of this idea, Villefort\u2019s face became so joyous, that when he turned to Dant\u00e8s, the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling also.", " \u201cHow should he have been otherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.\u201d \u201cAnd for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it.\u201d And here the look of the abb\u00e9, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse. \u201cA rich Englishman,\u201d continued the abb\u00e9, \u201cwho had been his companion in misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second restoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he bestowed on Dant\u00e8s upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dant\u00e8s had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement. Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dant\u00e8s carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.\u201d \u201cThen, I suppose,\u201d asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, \u201cthat it was a stone of immense value?\u201d \u201cWhy, everything is relative,\u201d answered the abb\u00e9. \u201cTo one in Edmond\u2019s position the diamond certainly was of great value."], "Who is Dant\u00e8s\u2019 steward?": [" \u201cWe must content ourselves, then,\u201d said Beauchamp, \u201cwith rendering the count all the little services in our power. I, in my quality of journalist, open all the theatres to him.\u201d \u201cThanks, monsieur,\u201d returned Monte Cristo, \u201cmy steward has orders to take a box at each theatre.\u201d \u201cIs your steward also a Nubian?\u201d asked Debray. \u201cNo, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of anyone\u2019s. But you know him, M. de Morcerf.\u201d \u201cIs it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows so well?\u201d \u201cYes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has been a soldier, a smuggler\u2014in fact, everything. I would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle\u2014a stab with a knife, for instance.\u201d \u201cAnd you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,\u201d said Debray. \u201cOf how much does he rob you every year?\u201d \u201cOn my word,\u201d replied the count, \u201cnot more than another. I am sure he answers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep him.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d continued Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, \u201csince you have an establishment, a steward, and a hotel in the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, you only want a mistress.\u201d Albert smiled. He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the count\u2019s box at the Argentina and Valle theatres. \u201cI have something better than that,\u201d said Monte Cristo; \u201cI have a slave. You procure your mistresses from the opera, the Vaudeville, or the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s; I purchased mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but I have nothing to fear.\u201d \u201cBut you forget,\u201d replied Debray, laughing, \u201cthat we are Franks by name and franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes free.\u201d \u201cWho will tell her?\u201d \u201cThe first person who sees her.\u201d \u201cShe only speaks Romaic.\u201d \u201cThat is different.\u201d \u201cBut at least we shall see her,\u201d said Beauchamp, \u201cor do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes?\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d replied Monte Cristo; \u201cI do not carry brutalism so far.", " \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong.

Danglars gave 16,000 francs for his horses?\u201d \u201cVery well. Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital.\u201d \u201cIs your excellency really in earnest?\u201d inquired the steward. Monte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased. \u201cI have to pay a visit this evening,\u201d replied he. \u201cI desire that these horses, with completely new harness, may be at the door with my carriage.\u201d Bertuccio bowed, and was about to retire; but when he reached the door, he paused, and then said, \u201cAt what o\u2019clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready?\u201d \u201cAt five o\u2019clock,\u201d replied the count. \u201cI beg your excellency\u2019s pardon,\u201d interposed the steward in a deprecating manner, \u201cfor venturing to observe that it is already two o\u2019clock.\u201d \u201cI am perfectly aware of that fact,\u201d answered Monte Cristo calmly. Then, turning towards Ali, he said, \u201cLet all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady, that she may select those she prefers for her carriage. Request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be served in her apartments. Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to come hither.\u201d Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber.", " When I live at Auteuil, you must come there, as you belong to my service.\u201d Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master, and remained motionless, without making any answer. \u201cWhy, what has happened to you?\u2014are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage?\u201d asked Monte Cristo, in the same tone that Louis XIV. pronounced the famous, \u201cI have been almost obliged to wait.\u201d Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber, and cried in a hoarse voice: \u201cHis excellency\u2019s horses!\u201d Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the steward appeared. \u201cYour excellency\u2019s carriage is at the door,\u201d said he. \u201cWell, take your hat and gloves,\u201d returned Monte Cristo. \u201cAm I to accompany you, your excellency?\u201d cried Bertuccio. \u201cCertainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the house.\u201d 20277m It was unexampled for a servant of the count\u2019s to dare to dispute an order of his, so the steward, without saying a word, followed his master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to follow, which he did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat. Chapter 43. The House at Auteuil Monte Cristo noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio signed himself in the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the carriage, muttered a short prayer. Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward\u2019s extraordinary repugnance for the count\u2019s projected drive without the walls; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey."], "Which of the following characters is not present when the plot to frame Dant\u00e8s is hatched?": [" I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you.\u201d Dant\u00e8s took the hand of the abb\u00e9 in his, and affectionately pressed it. Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend. Chapter 18. The Treasure When Dant\u00e8s returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he inquired. \u201cLook at it,\u201d said the abb\u00e9 with a smile. \u201cI have looked at it with all possible attention,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.\u201d \u201cThis paper, my friend,\u201d said Faria, \u201cI may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity\u2014this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.\u201d The sweat started forth on Dant\u00e8s\u2019 brow. Until this day and for how long a time!\u2014he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abb\u00e9 the accusation of madness.", " 0243m \u201cI awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it. \u201cBut beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dant\u00e8s, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.\u201d Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dant\u00e8s, who this time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust: \u201cThis 25th day of April, 1498, be... Alexander VI., and fearing that not... he may desire to become my heir, and re... and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,... my sole heir, that I have bu... and has visited with me, that is, in...

Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested.", " Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present, which Dant\u00e8s hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of Dant\u00e8s gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy. The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_ having expired, Dant\u00e8s took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him further. The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions from Dant\u00e8s to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo. Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dant\u00e8s proceeded to make his final adieus on board _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_, distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all, and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans. Then Dant\u00e8s departed for Genoa. At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs."], "Who is Lucien Debray\u2019s lover?": [" Madame Danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still strikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work, while Lucien Debray, standing before a small work-table, was turning over the pages of an album. Lucien had found time, preparatory to the count\u2019s arrival, to relate many particulars respecting him to Madame Danglars. It will be remembered that Monte Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf; and although Debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count, consequently the description given by Lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own heated imagination. Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to, and fully credited, all the additional circumstances detailed by Debray. This posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution. A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on M. Danglars; the count, in return for his gentlemanly bow, received a formal though graceful courtesy, while Lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition, and with Danglars a free and easy nod.", " The baroness was also surprised, and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations. The result was, that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose. \u201cM. Lucien,\u201d said the baroness, \u201cI assure you I have no desire to sleep, and that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening, which you must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.\u201d \u201cI am at your service, madame,\u201d replied Lucien coldly. \u201cMy dear M. Debray,\u201d said the banker, \u201cdo not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as well tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you will allow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.\u201d This time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien and the baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with their eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband was victorious. \u201cDo not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray,\u201d continued Danglars; \u201coh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I make such a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.\u201d Debray muttered something, bowed and went out, knocking himself against the edge of the door, like Nathan in _Athalie_.", " Then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel. Lucien looked at her for a moment in silence. \u201cCome, Hermine,\u201d he said, after a short time, \u201canswer candidly,\u2014something vexes you\u2014is it not so?\u201d 30239m \u201cNothing,\u201d answered the baroness. And yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards a looking-glass. \u201cI am frightful tonight,\u201d she said. Debray rose, smiling, and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point, when the door opened suddenly. M. Danglars appeared; Debray reseated himself. At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round, and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal. \u201cGood-evening, madame,\u201d said the banker; \u201cgood-evening, M. Debray.\u201d Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming a dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her husband. \u201cRead me something, M. Debray,\u201d she said. Debray, who was slightly disturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl knife inlaid with gold. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said the banker, \u201cbut you will tire yourself, baroness, by such late hours, and M. Debray lives some distance from here.\u201d Debray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and politely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do.", " Debray?\u201d inquired Danglars, with an air of indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile, acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker\u2019s domestic life. \u201cYes, my lord,\u201d replied the servant, \u201cM. Debray is with madame.\u201d Danglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, \u201cM. Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the Minister of the Interior. As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in France. Her maiden name was De Servi\u00e8res, and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne.\u201d \u201cI have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already met M. Lucien Debray.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed?\u201d said Danglars; \u201cand where was that?\u201d \u201cAt the house of M. de Morcerf.\u201d \u201cAh! you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?\u201d \u201cWe were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.\u201d \u201cTrue, true,\u201d cried Danglars. \u201cLet me see; have I not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of his having had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from Italy.\u201d \u201cHer ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,\u201d said the servant, who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress. \u201cWith your permission,\u201d said Danglars, bowing, \u201cI will precede you, to show you the way.\u201d \u201cBy all means,\u201d replied Monte Cristo; \u201cI follow you.\u201d Chapter 47."], "Caderousse illustrates that human happiness is attributable largely to ___.": [" I have dined many times with him and the Count of Morcerf, so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.\u201d \u201cCome, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.\u201d \u201cThat is all very fine, Benedetto mio, but I know what I am saying. Perhaps I may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at the great gate, introduce myself. Meanwhile let us sit down and eat.\u201d Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite, praising each dish he set before his visitor. The latter seemed to have resigned himself; he drew the corks, and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat. \u201cAh, mate,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cyou are getting on better terms with your old landlord!\u201d \u201cFaith, yes,\u201d replied Andrea, whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling. \u201cSo you like it, you rogue?\u201d \u201cSo much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living.\u201d \u201cDo you see,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201call my happiness is marred by one thought?\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d \u201cThat I am dependent on another, I who have always gained my own livelihood honestly.\u201d \u201cDo not let that disturb you, I have enough for two.\u201d \u201cNo, truly; you may believe me if you will; at the end of every month I am tormented by remorse.\u201d \u201cGood Caderousse!\u201d \u201cSo much so, that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs.\u201d \u201cYes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?\u201d \u201cTrue remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.\u201d Andrea shuddered; he always did so at Caderousse\u2019s ideas.", " Edmond had one friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.\u201d 0351m \u201cOh, sir,\u201d said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,\u2014\u201cOh, sir, do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.\u201d \u201cI know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange\u2014\u2014\u201d Caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand. The abb\u00e9 smiled. \u201cIn exchange,\u201d he continued, \u201cgive me the red silk purse that M. Morrel left on old Dant\u00e8s\u2019 chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in your hands.\u201d Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abb\u00e9 a long purse of faded red silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The abb\u00e9 took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond. \u201cOh, you are a man of God, sir,\u201d cried Caderousse; \u201cfor no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.\u201d \u201cWhich,\u201d said the abb\u00e9 to himself, \u201cyou would have done.\u201d The abb\u00e9 rose, took his hat and gloves. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201call you have told me is perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.\u201d \u201cSee, sir,\u201d replied Caderousse, \u201cin this corner is a crucifix in holy wood\u2014here on this shelf is my wife\u2019s testament; open this book, and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix.", " I have tried to make you a happy man, and you have turned out a murderer.\u201d \u201cOh, monsieur,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cmake one more attempt\u2014try me once more!\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said the count. \u201cListen\u2014you know if I may be relied on.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cIf you arrive safely at home\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat have I to fear, except from you?\u201d \u201cIf you reach your home safely, leave Paris, leave France, and wherever you may be, so long as you conduct yourself well, I will send you a small annuity; for, if you return home safely, then\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cThen?\u201d asked Caderousse, shuddering. 40164m \u201cThen I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you too.\u201d \u201cAs true as I am a Christian,\u201d stammered Caderousse, \u201cyou will make me die of fright!\u201d \u201cNow begone,\u201d said the count, pointing to the window. Caderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder. \u201cNow go down,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, folding his arms. Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him, Caderousse began to go down. Then the count brought the taper to the window, that it might be seen in the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light. \u201cWhat are you doing, reverend sir? Suppose a watchman should pass?\u201d And he blew out the light. He then descended, but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety. Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the garden to the street, he saw first Caderousse, who after walking to the end of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in.", " \u201cYes\u2014yes,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cbut you were right to return as soon as possible, my boy.\u201d \u201cAnd why?\u201d \u201cBecause Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack followers; she particularly has them by dozens.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness. 0039m \u201cAh, yes,\u201d continued Caderousse, \u201cand capital offers, too; but you know, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?\u201d \u201cMeaning to say,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, with a smile which but ill-concealed his trouble, \u201cthat if I were not a captain\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cEh\u2014eh!\u201d said Caderousse, shaking his head. \u201cCome, come,\u201d said the sailor, \u201cI have a better opinion than you of women in general, and of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s in particular; and I am certain that, captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.\u201d \u201cSo much the better\u2014so much the better,\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cWhen one is going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but never mind that, my boy,\u2014go and announce your arrival, and let her know all your hopes and prospects.\u201d \u201cI will go directly,\u201d was Edmond\u2019s reply; and, embracing his father, and nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment. Caderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old Dant\u00e8s, he went downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of the Rue Senac. \u201cWell,\u201d said Danglars, \u201cdid you see him?\u201d \u201cI have just left him,\u201d answered Caderousse. \u201cDid he allude to his hope of being captain?\u201d \u201cHe spoke of it as a thing already decided.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d said Danglars, \u201che is in too much hurry, it appears to me.\u201d \u201cWhy, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.\u201d \u201cSo that he is quite elated about it?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, he is actually insolent over the matter\u2014has already offered me his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a loan of money, as though he were a banker.\u201d \u201cWhich you refused?\u201d \u201cMost assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it was I who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M. Dant\u00e8s has no longer any occasion for assistance\u2014he is about to become a captain.\u201d \u201cPooh!\u201d said Danglars, \u201che is not one yet.\u201d \u201c_Ma foi!_ it will be as well if he is not,\u201d answered Caderousse; \u201cfor if he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.\u201d \u201cIf we choose,\u201d replied Danglars, \u201che will remain what he is; and perhaps become even less than he is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cNothing\u2014I was speaking to myself."], "The good fortune of Caderousse\u2019s friends make him ___.": [" It was estimated at fifty thousand francs.\u201d \u201cBless me!\u201d exclaimed Caderousse, \u201cfifty thousand francs! Surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9, \u201cit was not of such a size as that; but you shall judge for yourself. I have it with me.\u201d The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest\u2019s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abb\u00e9 opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship. \u201cAnd that diamond,\u201d cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, \u201cyou say, is worth fifty thousand francs?\u201d \u201cIt is, without the setting, which is also valuable,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper. \u201cBut how comes the diamond in your possession, sir? Did Edmond make you his heir?\u201d \u201cNo, merely his testamentary executor. \u2018I once possessed four dear and faithful friends, besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed\u2019 he said; \u2018and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss. The name of one of the four friends is Caderousse.\u2019\u201d The innkeeper shivered. \u201c\u2018Another of the number,\u2019\u201d continued the abb\u00e9, without seeming to notice the emotion of Caderousse, \u201c\u2018is called Danglars; and the third, in spite of being my rival, entertained a very sincere affection for me.\u2019\u201d A fiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse, who was about to break in upon the abb\u00e9\u2019s speech, when the latter, waving his hand, said, \u201cAllow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations to make, you can do so afterwards.", " Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect. \u201cIt is a false diamond,\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cYou are joking now,\u201d replied Andrea. \u201cDo not be angry, we can try it.\u201d Caderousse went to the window, touched the glass with it, and found it would cut. \u201c_Confiteor!_\u201d said Caderousse, putting the diamond on his little finger; \u201cI was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller\u2019s shop\u2014it is another branch of industry paralyzed.\u201d \u201cHave you finished?\u201d said Andrea,\u2014\u201cdo you want anything more?\u2014will you have my waistcoat or my hat?

It\u2019s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health.\u201d \u201cMy health is well enough,\u201d said Fernand, clenching his hands without raising his head. \u201cAh, you see, Danglars,\u201d said Caderousse, winking at his friend, \u201cthis is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very fine girl, named Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the _Pharaon_; and as the _Pharaon_ arrived today\u2014why, you understand!\u201d \u201cNo; I do not understand,\u201d said Danglars."], "Despite her avowed weakness and fear, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s is capable of great ___.": [" \u201cWill you not even say you will see me again?\u201d he asked. \u201cOn the contrary, we shall meet again,\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, pointing to heaven with solemnity. \u201cI tell you so to prove to you that I still hope.\u201d And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s rushed up the stairs and disappeared. Monte Cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay. But Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s did not witness his departure, although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old Dant\u00e8s. Her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea; but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly: \u201cEdmond, Edmond, Edmond!\u201d Chapter 113. The Past The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation which had just taken place between Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them. A man of the count\u2019s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys superior ones. He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself.", " Death is about to return to the tomb, the phantom to retire in darkness.\u201d \u201cWhat do you say, Edmond?\u201d \u201cI say, since you command me, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, I must die.\u201d \u201cDie? and why so? Who talks of dying? Whence have you these ideas of death?\u201d \u201cYou do not suppose that, publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre, in the presence of your friends and those of your son\u2014challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory\u2014you do not suppose that I can for one moment wish to live. What I most loved after you, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, was myself, my dignity, and that strength which rendered me superior to other men; that strength was my life. With one word you have crushed it, and I die.\u201d \u201cBut the duel will not take place, Edmond, since you forgive?\u201d \u201cIt will take place,\u201d said Monte Cristo, in a most solemn tone; \u201cbut instead of your son\u2019s blood to stain the ground, mine will flow.\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s shrieked, and sprang towards Monte Cristo, but, suddenly stopping, \u201cEdmond,\u201d said she, \u201cthere is a God above us, since you live and since I have seen you again; I trust to him from my heart. While waiting his assistance I trust to your word; you have said that my son should live, have you not?\u201d \u201cYes, madame, he shall live,\u201d said Monte Cristo, surprised that without more emotion Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s extended her hand to the count. \u201cEdmond,\u201d said she, and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke, \u201chow noble it is of you, how great the action you have just performed, how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her, Alas, I am grown old with grief more than with years, and cannot now remind my Edmond by a smile, or by a look, of that Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating.", " And then, it must be confessed, Fernand had never been hated\u2014he was only not precisely loved. Another possessed all Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s\u2019 heart; that other was absent, had disappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s burst into a flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another, came now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old Dant\u00e8s incessantly said to her, \u2018Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would return to us.\u2019 \u201cThe old man died, as I have told you; had he lived, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when he learned of the old man\u2019s death he returned. He was now a lieutenant. At his first coming he had not said a word of love to Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s; at the second he reminded her that he loved her. \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for Edmond.\u201d \u201cSo that,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, with a bitter smile, \u201cthat makes eighteen months in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?\u201d Then he murmured the words of the English poet, \u201c\u2018Frailty, thy name is woman.\u2019\u201d \u201cSix months afterwards,\u201d continued Caderousse, \u201cthe marriage took place in the church of Accoules.\u201d \u201cThe very church in which she was to have married Edmond,\u201d murmured the priest; \u201cthere was only a change of bridegrooms.\u201d \u201cWell, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s was married,\u201d proceeded Caderousse; \u201cbut although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed La R\u00e9serve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had she looked to the bottom of her heart.", " What new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before God?\u201d A mournful sob burst from Villefort\u2019s heart; he approached the doctor, and seizing his arm,\u2014\u201cValentine,\u201d said he, \u201cit is Valentine\u2019s turn!\u201d 40284m \u201cYour daughter!\u201d cried d\u2019Avrigny with grief and surprise. \u201cYou see you were deceived,\u201d murmured the magistrate; \u201ccome and see her, and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her.\u201d \u201cEach time you have applied to me,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cit has been too late; still I will go. But let us make haste, sir; with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost.\u201d \u201cOh, this time, doctor, you shall not have to reproach me with weakness. This time I will know the assassin, and will pursue him.\u201d \u201cLet us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her,\u201d said d\u2019Avrigny. \u201cCome.\u201d The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full speed, and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte Cristo\u2019s door. The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which Bertuccio had brought in haste. Hearing the name of Morrel, who had left him only two hours before, the count raised his head, arose, and sprang to meet him. \u201cWhat is the matter, Maximilian?\u201d asked he; \u201cyou are pale, and the perspiration rolls from your forehead.\u201d Morrel fell into a chair. \u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cI came quickly; I wanted to speak to you.\u201d \u201cAre all your family well?\u201d asked the count, with an affectionate benevolence, whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt."], "In the two decades that the novel spans, what is the primary driver of all Danglars\u2019 actions?": [" Chapter 67. The Office of the King\u2019s Attorney Let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and follow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion. We have said that at half-past twelve o\u2019clock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses, and had left home in the carriage. She directed her course towards the Faubourg Saint Germain, went down the Rue Mazarine, and stopped at the Passage du Pont-Neuf. She descended, and went through the passage. She was very plainly dressed, as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning. At the Rue Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud she called a cab, and directed the driver to go to the Rue de Harlay. As soon as she was seated in the vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil, which she tied on to her straw bonnet. She then replaced the bonnet, and saw with pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible. The cab crossed the Pont-Neuf and entered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine; the driver was paid as the door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon reached the Salle des Pas-Perdus. There was a great deal going on that morning, and many business-like persons at the Palais; business-like persons pay very little attention to women, and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer.", " Andrea assumed his gayest manner. \u201cYou know, my dear count,\u201d said he, \u201cthe ceremony is to take place this evening. At nine o\u2019clock the contract is to be signed at my father-in-law\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed?\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cWhat; is it news to you? Has not M. Danglars informed you of the ceremony?\u201d \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said the count; \u201cI received a letter from him yesterday, but I do not think the hour was mentioned.\u201d \u201cPossibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cyou are fortunate, M. Cavalcanti; it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting, and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed she is,\u201d replied Cavalcanti, in a very modest tone. \u201cAbove all, she is very rich,\u2014at least, I believe so,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cVery rich, do you think?\u201d replied the young man. \u201cDoubtless; it is said M. Danglars conceals at least half of his fortune.\u201d \u201cAnd he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions,\u201d said Andrea with a look sparkling with joy. \u201cWithout reckoning,\u201d added Monte Cristo, \u201cthat he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England, but quite novel in France.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I know what you mean,\u2014the railway, of which he has obtained the grant, is it not?\u201d \u201cPrecisely; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair.\u201d \u201cTen millions! Do you think so? It is magnificent!\u201d said Cavalcanti, who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words.", " My safety is now a mere question of speed.\u201d At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonni\u00e8re. The dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along toward the limits of the Faubourg Saint-Denis, where no doubt he ordinarily had his station. \u201cHo, friend!\u201d said Benedetto. \u201cWhat do you want, sir?\u201d asked the driver. \u201cIs your horse tired?\u201d \u201cTired? oh, yes, tired enough\u2014he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day!

A child encumbers a fugitive; perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it into the river.\u201d \u201cImpossible!\u201d cried Madame Danglars: \u201ca man may murder another out of revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.\u201d \u201cPerhaps,\u201d continued Villefort, \u201che had put it in the foundling hospital.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, yes,\u201d cried the baroness; \u201cmy child is there!\u201d \u201cI ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night\u2014the night of the 20th of September\u2014a child had been brought there, wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half.

Alas, no, I know not. A woman, about six months after, came to claim it with the other half of the napkin.

It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased Edmond\u2019s admiration of him; but at the same time Dant\u00e8s could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there. However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had repaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dant\u00e8s had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered, the abb\u00e9 had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a stronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes. \u201cYou see,\u201d said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to Faria, \u201cthat God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever with you, and now I could not break my promise if I would.", " Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. \u201cThen you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.\u201d \u201cWhat, did you refuse to dine with him?\u201d said old Dant\u00e8s; \u201cand did he invite you to dine?\u201d \u201cYes, my dear father,\u201d replied Edmond, smiling at his father\u2019s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son. \u201cAnd why did you refuse, my son?\u201d inquired the old man. \u201cThat I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,\u201d replied the young man. \u201cI was most anxious to see you.\u201d \u201cBut it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cAnd when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy the owner.\u201d \u201cBut I explained to him the cause of my refusal,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand I hope he fully understood it.\u201d \u201cYes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one\u2019s patrons.\u201d \u201cI hope to be captain without that,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s. \u201cSo much the better\u2014so much the better!

Who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may last?\u201d In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes, Dant\u00e8s did not lose his presence of mind, but descended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abb\u00e9\u2019s chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed."], "Dant\u00e8s sees himself as an agent of ___.": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong.

One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If, he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither. 0315m Still Dant\u00e8s could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria, Dant\u00e8s coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation. The first person to attract the attention of Dant\u00e8s, as he landed on the Canebi\u00e8re, was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon_.", " Have you that means?\u201d \u201cIt is to be found for the searching. But why should I meddle in the matter? it is no affair of mine.\u201d \u201cI know not why you meddle,\u201d said Fernand, seizing his arm; \u201cbut this I know, you have some motive of personal hatred against Dant\u00e8s, for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.\u201d \u201cI! motives of hatred against Dant\u00e8s? None, on my word! I saw you were unhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; that\u2019s all; but since you believe I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get out of the affair as best you may;\u201d and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart. \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Fernand, restraining him, \u201cstay! It is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against Dant\u00e8s. I hate him! I confess it openly. Do you find the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man, for Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s has declared she will kill herself if Dant\u00e8s is killed.\u201d Caderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and looking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said, \u201cKill Dant\u00e8s! who talks of killing Dant\u00e8s? I won\u2019t have him killed\u2014I won\u2019t! He\u2019s my friend, and this morning offered to share his money with me, as I shared mine with him. I won\u2019t have Dant\u00e8s killed\u2014I won\u2019t!\u201d \u201cAnd who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?\u201d replied Danglars. \u201cWe were merely joking; drink to his health,\u201d he added, filling Caderousse\u2019s glass, \u201cand do not interfere with us.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, Dant\u00e8s\u2019 good health!\u201d said Caderousse, emptying his glass, \u201chere\u2019s to his health!", " It was four o\u2019clock when Dant\u00e8s was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of March, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him, but the sound died away, and Dant\u00e8s sank again into his seat. At last, about ten o\u2019clock, and just as Dant\u00e8s began to despair, steps were heard in the corridor, a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, the massy oaken door flew open, and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment. By the torchlight Dant\u00e8s saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes. He had advanced at first, but stopped at the sight of this display of force. \u201cAre you come to fetch me?\u201d asked he. \u201cYes,\u201d replied a gendarme. \u201cBy the orders of the deputy procureur?\u201d \u201cI believe so.\u201d The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort relieved all Dant\u00e8s\u2019 apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed himself in the centre of the escort. A carriage waited at the door, the coachman was on the box, and a police officer sat beside him. \u201cIs this carriage for me?\u201d said Dant\u00e8s. \u201cIt is for you,\u201d replied a gendarme. Dant\u00e8s was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and having neither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the steps, and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the two others took their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones."], "Dant\u00e8s\u2019 plunge into the sea after escaping from prison is symbolic of what religious ceremony?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested.", " The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point.

Well, Dant\u00e8s, you do not thank me?\u201d \u201cThis treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand to you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.\u201d \u201cYou are my son, Dant\u00e8s,\u201d exclaimed the old man.", " By degrees the wind abated, vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars. Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded their foaming crests with gold. It was day. Dant\u00e8s stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if he now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed. He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and land. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o\u2019clock. The sea continued to get calmer. \u201cIn two or three hours,\u201d thought Dant\u00e8s, \u201cthe turnkey will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I am cold, I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. Oh, my God, I have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what I am unable to do for myself.\u201d As Dant\u00e8s (his eyes turned in the direction of the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If) uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pom\u00e8gue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and with his sailor\u2019s eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan.", " \u201cBut what if I am not liberated,\u201d cried he, \u201cand am detained here until my death? this treasure will be lost. Had not government better profit by it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the rest, if they will only give me my liberty.\u201d \u201cOn my word,\u201d said the inspector in a low tone, \u201chad I not been told beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.\u201d \u201cI am not mad,\u201d replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners. \u201cThe treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,\u2014I ask no more.\u201d The governor laughed. \u201cIs the spot far from here?\u201d \u201cA hundred leagues.\u201d \u201cIt is not ill-planned,\u201d said the governor. \u201cIf all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of escaping.\u201d \u201cThe scheme is well known,\u201d said the inspector; \u201cand the abb\u00e9\u2019s plan has not even the merit of originality.\u201d Then turning to Faria, \u201cI inquired if you are well fed?\u201d said he. \u201cSwear to me,\u201d replied Faria, \u201cto free me if what I tell you prove true, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.\u201d \u201cAre you well fed?\u201d repeated the inspector. \u201cMonsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so there is no chance of my escaping.\u201d \u201cYou do not reply to my question,\u201d replied the inspector impatiently."], "Which political party of the era do all the novel\u2019s sympathetic characters have a connection with?": [" 0243m \u201cI awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but, as no one came, I determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it. \u201cBut beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dant\u00e8s, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.\u201d Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dant\u00e8s, who this time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust: \u201cThis 25th day of April, 1498, be... Alexander VI., and fearing that not... he may desire to become my heir, and re... and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,... my sole heir, that I have bu... and has visited with me, that is, in... Island of Monte Cristo, all I poss... jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone... may amount to nearly two mil... will find on raising the twentieth ro... creek to the east in a right line.", " In this case, however, although the occasion of the entertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar. Instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles society,\u2014magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper\u2019s reign; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Cond\u00e9; and younger members of families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god. The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling. The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls,\u2014after having been accustomed to hear the \u201c_Vive Napol\u00e9ons_\u201d of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,\u2014was looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne. The magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while the women commented on the divorce of Josephine.", " \u201cMy name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s,\u201d replied the young man calmly; \u201cI am mate of the _Pharaon_, belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.\u201d \u201cYour age?\u201d continued Villefort. \u201cNineteen,\u201d returned Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWhat were you doing at the moment you were arrested?\u201d \u201cI was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,\u201d said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. \u201cYou were at the festival of your marriage?\u201d said the deputy, shuddering in spite of himself. \u201cYes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years.\u201d Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dant\u00e8s, surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom\u2014he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. \u201cThis philosophic reflection,\u201d thought he, \u201cwill make a great sensation at M. de Saint-M\u00e9ran\u2019s;\u201d and he arranged mentally, while Dant\u00e8s awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dant\u00e8s. 0099m \u201cGo on, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cWhat would you have me say?\u201d \u201cGive all the information in your power.\u201d \u201cTell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only,\u201d added he, with a smile, \u201cI warn you I know very little.\u201d \u201cHave you served under the usurper?\u201d \u201cI was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.\u201d \u201cIt is reported your political opinions are extreme,\u201d said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.", " It is perhaps needless to add that Morrel departed almost at the same time. Chapter 72. Madame de Saint-M\u00e9ran A gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort. After the ladies had departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties of Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them, the procureur had shut himself up in his study, according to his custom, with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else, but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires. But this time the papers were a mere matter of form. Villefort had secluded himself, not to study, but to reflect; and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business, he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events, the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections. Then, instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him, he opened the drawer of his desk, touched a spring, and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda, amongst which he had carefully arranged, in characters only known to himself, the names of all those who, either in his political career, in money matters, at the bar, or in his mysterious love affairs, had become his enemies. Their number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet these names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the almost impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has so perilously climbed."], "Which of the following is symbolic of the connection between good deeds and reward?": [" The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point.

Morrel. To doubt any longer was impossible; there was the evidence of the senses, and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony. As Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with his face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the sentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low tone: \u201cBe happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds.\u201d 20064m And with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his hiding-place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted \u201cJacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!\u201d Then a launch came to shore, took him on board, and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor; thence he once again looked towards Morrel, who, weeping with joy, was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him, and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said the unknown, \u201cfarewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude!

Chapter 76. Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger Meanwhile M. Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in the army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table of the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers. He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father. M. Andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva Corsinari. He was now fairly launched in that Parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners, and treats them, not as they really are, but as they wish to be considered. Besides, what is required of a young man in Paris? To speak its language tolerably, to make a good appearance, to be a good gamester, and to pay in cash. They are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a Frenchman. Andrea had, then, in a fortnight, attained a very fair position. He was called count, he was said to possess 50,000 livres per annum; and his father\u2019s immense riches, buried in the quarries of Saravezza, were a constant theme.", " If he were rich, if he had Cavalcanti\u2019s fortune, that might be pardoned. _Ma foi_, I haven\u2019t consulted my daughter; but if she has good taste\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cmy fondness may blind me, but I assure you I consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction, and his father\u2019s position is good.\u201d \u201cHem,\u201d said Danglars. \u201cWhy do you doubt?\u201d \u201cThe past\u2014that obscurity on the past.\u201d \u201cBut that does not affect the son.\u201d \u201cVery true.\u201d \u201cNow, I beg of you, don\u2019t go off your head.

I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.\u201d The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust. Dant\u00e8s examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels. \u201cAs for the ink,\u201d said Faria, \u201cI told you how I managed to obtain that\u2014and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.\u201d \u201cOne thing still puzzles me,\u201d observed Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?\u201d \u201cI worked at night also,\u201d replied Faria. \u201cNight!\u2014why, for Heaven\u2019s sake, are your eyes like cats\u2019, that you can see to work in the dark?\u201d \u201cIndeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I furnished myself with a light.\u201d \u201cYou did? Pray tell me how.\u201d \u201cI separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made oil\u2014here is my lamp.\u201d So saying, the abb\u00e9 exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations. \u201cBut how do you procure a light?\u201d \u201cOh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.\u201d \u201cAnd matches?\u201d \u201cI pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little sulphur, which was readily supplied.\u201d Dant\u00e8s laid the different things he had been looking at on the table, and stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of Faria\u2019s mind.", " It was four o\u2019clock when Dant\u00e8s was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said, the 1st of March, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate him, but the sound died away, and Dant\u00e8s sank again into his seat. At last, about ten o\u2019clock, and just as Dant\u00e8s began to despair, steps were heard in the corridor, a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked, the massy oaken door flew open, and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment. By the torchlight Dant\u00e8s saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes. He had advanced at first, but stopped at the sight of this display of force. \u201cAre you come to fetch me?\u201d asked he. \u201cYes,\u201d replied a gendarme. \u201cBy the orders of the deputy procureur?\u201d \u201cI believe so.\u201d The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort relieved all Dant\u00e8s\u2019 apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed himself in the centre of the escort. A carriage waited at the door, the coachman was on the box, and a police officer sat beside him. \u201cIs this carriage for me?\u201d said Dant\u00e8s. \u201cIt is for you,\u201d replied a gendarme. Dant\u00e8s was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and having neither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the steps, and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the two others took their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones.", " \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested."], "What is Edmond Dant\u00e8s\u2019 position on the ship Pharaon, which arrives at Marseilles in the first chapter?": [" The Trial Chapter 87.

Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.\u201d \u201cTrue, Dant\u00e8s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father\u2014the lovely Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.\u201d Dant\u00e8s blushed. \u201cAh, ha,\u201d said the shipowner, \u201cI am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!\u201d \u201cShe is not my mistress,\u201d replied the young sailor, gravely; \u201cshe is my betrothed.\u201d \u201cSometimes one and the same thing,\u201d said Morrel, with a smile. \u201cNot with us, sir,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWell, well, my dear Edmond,\u201d continued the owner, \u201cdon\u2019t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?\u201d \u201cNo, sir; I have all my pay to take\u2014nearly three months\u2019 wages.\u201d \u201cYou are a careful fellow, Edmond.\u201d \u201cSay I have a poor father, sir.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father."], "After the Pharaon arrives at Marseilles, who is the first person Dant\u00e8s goes to see after leaving the docks?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong.

Goodnight.\u201d And before Dant\u00e8s could open his mouth\u2014before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water\u2014before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was, the jailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door, leaving stamped upon the prisoner\u2019s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon. Dant\u00e8s was alone in darkness and in silence\u2014cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead. With the first dawn of day the jailer returned, with orders to leave Dant\u00e8s where he was. He found the prisoner in the same position, as if fixed there, his eyes swollen with weeping. He had passed the night standing, and without sleep. The jailer advanced; Dant\u00e8s appeared not to perceive him. He touched him on the shoulder. Edmond started. \u201cHave you not slept?\u201d said the jailer. \u201cI do not know,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. The jailer stared. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d continued he. \u201cI do not know.\u201d \u201cDo you wish for anything?\u201d \u201cI wish to see the governor.\u201d The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber. Dant\u00e8s followed him with his eyes, and stretched forth his hands towards the open door; but the door closed. All his emotion then burst forth; he cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished.", " \u201cIs this all?\u201d \u201cNo, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild & Turner of Marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000 francs; in all, 287,500 francs.\u201d It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumeration. \u201cTwo hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs,\u201d repeated he. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied the Englishman. \u201cI will not,\u201d continued he, after a moment\u2019s silence, \u201cconceal from you, that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged, yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities.\u201d At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly pale. \u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cup to this time\u2014and it is now more than four-and-twenty years since I received the direction of this house from my father, who had himself conducted it for five-and-thirty years\u2014never has anything bearing the signature of Morrel & Son been dishonored.\u201d \u201cI know that,\u201d replied the Englishman. \u201cBut as a man of honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same punctuality?\u201d Morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown. \u201cTo questions frankly put,\u201d said he, \u201ca straightforward answer should be given. Yes, I shall pay, if, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely; for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents, of which I have been the victim, have deprived me; but if the _Pharaon_ should be lost, and this last resource be gone\u2014\u2014\u201d The poor man\u2019s eyes filled with tears.", " \u201cBut in his present condition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it afterwards.\u201d \u201cI will do more than I promise,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWe shall see,\u201d returned the other, smiling. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asked Dant\u00e8s. \u201cTo Leghorn.\u201d \u201cThen why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the wind?\u201d \u201cBecause we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.\u201d \u201cYou shall pass it by twenty fathoms.\u201d \u201cTake the helm, and let us see what you know.\u201d The young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailor, she yet was tolerably obedient. \u201cTo the sheets,\u201d said he. The four seamen, who composed the crew, obeyed, while the pilot looked on. \u201cHaul taut.\u201d They obeyed. \u201cBelay.\u201d This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as Dant\u00e8s had predicted, twenty fathoms to windward. \u201cBravo!\u201d said the captain. \u201cBravo!\u201d repeated the sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing. \u201cYou see,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, quitting the helm, \u201cI shall be of some use to you, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get, for my food and the clothes you lend me.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said the captain, \u201cwe can agree very well, if you are reasonable.\u201d \u201cGive me what you give the others, and it will be all right,\u201d returned Dant\u00e8s."], "Although Dant\u00e8s does not reveal his intended business in Paris, his friends suspect he\u2019s delivering a letter to supporters of ___.": [" And why were you alone?\u201d 40231m \u201cBecause you had been arrested, Edmond, and were a prisoner.\u201d \u201cAnd why was I arrested? Why was I a prisoner?\u201d \u201cI do not know,\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. \u201cYou do not, madame; at least, I hope not. But I will tell you. I was arrested and became a prisoner because, under the arbor of La R\u00e9serve, the day before I was to marry you, a man named Danglars wrote this letter, which the fisherman Fernand himself posted.\u201d Monte Cristo went to a secretaire, opened a drawer by a spring, from which he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue\u2014this he placed in the hands of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. It was Danglars\u2019 letter to the king\u2019s attorney, which the Count of Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson & French, had taken from the file against Edmond Dant\u00e8s, on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s read with terror the following lines: \u201cThe king\u2019s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one Edmond Dant\u00e8s, second in command on board the _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, is the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dant\u00e8s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father\u2019s abode.", " \u201cI am free, then, sir?\u201d cried Dant\u00e8s joyfully. \u201cYes; but first give me this letter.\u201d \u201cYou have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that packet.\u201d \u201cStop a moment,\u201d said the deputy, as Dant\u00e8s took his hat and gloves. \u201cTo whom is it addressed?\u201d _\u201cTo Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-H\u00e9ron, Paris.\u201d_ Had a thunderbolt fallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He sank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the fatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror. \u201cM. Noirtier, Rue Coq-H\u00e9ron, No. 13,\u201d murmured he, growing still paler. \u201cYes,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s; \u201cdo you know him?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Villefort; \u201ca faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators.\u201d 0103m \u201cIt is a conspiracy, then?\u201d asked Dant\u00e8s, who after believing himself free, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. \u201cI have, however, already told you, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter.\u201d \u201cYes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,\u201d said Villefort. \u201cI was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.\u201d \u201cHave you shown this letter to anyone?\u201d asked Villefort, becoming still more pale. \u201cTo no one, on my honor.\u201d \u201cEverybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the Island of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?\u201d \u201cEverybody, except the person who gave it to me.\u201d \u201cAnd that was too much, far too much,\u201d murmured Villefort.", " It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.\u201d \u201cTalking of Captain Leclere, has not Dant\u00e8s given you a letter from him?\u201d \u201cTo me?\u2014no\u2014was there one?\u201d \u201cI believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care.\u201d \u201cOf what packet are you speaking, Danglars?\u201d \u201cWhy, that which Dant\u00e8s left at Porto-Ferrajo.\u201d \u201cHow do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?\u201d Danglars turned very red. \u201cI was passing close to the door of the captain\u2019s cabin, which was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dant\u00e8s.\u201d \u201cHe did not speak to me of it,\u201d replied the shipowner; \u201cbut if there be any letter he will give it to me.\u201d Danglars reflected for a moment. \u201cThen, M. Morrel, I beg of you,\u201d said he, \u201cnot to say a word to Dant\u00e8s on the subject. I may have been mistaken.\u201d At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew. \u201cWell, my dear Dant\u00e8s, are you now free?\u201d inquired the owner. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d \u201cYou have not been long detained.\u201d \u201cNo. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I gave them.\u201d \u201cThen you have nothing more to do here?\u201d \u201cNo\u2014everything is all right now.\u201d \u201cThen you can come and dine with me?\u201d \u201cI really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel.

You are in a hurry, captain!\u201d \u201cDanglars,\u201d said Edmond, smiling, \u201cI will say to you as Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s said just now to Caderousse, \u2018Do not give me a title which does not belong to me\u2019; that may bring me bad luck.\u201d \u201cYour pardon,\u201d replied Danglars, \u201cI merely said you seemed in a hurry, and we have lots of time; the _Pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in less than three months.\u201d \u201cWe are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I must go to Paris.\u201d \u201cAh, really?\u2014to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been there, Dant\u00e8s?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHave you business there?\u201d \u201cNot of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know to what I allude, Danglars\u2014it is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the time to go and return.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I understand,\u201d said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he added, \u201cTo Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea\u2014a capital idea! Ah; Dant\u00e8s, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship _Pharaon_;\u201d then turning towards Edmond, who was walking away, \u201cA pleasant journey,\u201d he cried. \u201cThank you,\u201d said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven."], "After Dant\u00e8s is arrested at his betrothal feast, who offers to take over duties as captain of the Pharaon?": [" Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.\u201d \u201cWas it not his betrothal feast?\u201d \u201cIt was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending; a police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dant\u00e8s was arrested.\u201d \u201cYes, and up to this point I know all,\u201d said the priest. \u201cDant\u00e8s himself only knew that which personally concerned him, for he never beheld again the five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of anyone of them.\u201d \u201cWell, when Dant\u00e8s was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the particulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his home, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up and down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all, for I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for myself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast. \u201cThe next day Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s came to implore the protection of M. de Villefort; she did not obtain it, however, and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so miserable and heart-broken, having passed a sleepless night, and not touched food since the previous day, she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him; but the old man would not consent. \u2018No,\u2019 was the old man\u2019s reply, \u2018I will not leave this house, for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world; and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if I did not wait here for him?\u2019 I heard all this from the window, for I was anxious that Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s should persuade the old man to accompany her, for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment\u2019s repose.\u201d \u201cBut did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?\u201d asked the abb\u00e9.", " \u201cUpon my word,\u201d cried the old man, \u201cyou make short work of this kind of affair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three o\u2019clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d asked Danglars, in a timid tone, \u201chow did you manage about the other formalities\u2014the contract\u2014the settlement?\u201d \u201cThe contract,\u201d answered Dant\u00e8s, laughingly, \u201cit didn\u2019t take long to fix that. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So, you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very expensive.\u201d This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause. \u201cSo that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cNo, no,\u201d answered Dant\u00e8s; \u201cdon\u2019t imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for Paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast.\u201d This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree, that the elder Dant\u00e8s, who, at the commencement of the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment\u2019s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom.", " At these words he gave me a ring. It was time\u2014two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.\u201d \u201cAnd what did you do then?\u201d \u201cWhat I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for the Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody to remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted. He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere\u2019s death; and, as the latter had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and tomorrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Villefort, \u201cthis seems to me the truth. If you have been culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from Elba, and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go and rejoin your friends.", " Attracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dant\u00e8s; but Dant\u00e8s, who had his own projects, would not agree for a longer time than three months. _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_ had a very active crew, very obedient to their captain, who lost as little time as possible. He had scarcely been a week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins, contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France. They sailed; Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in prison. He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon. The next morning going on deck, as he always did at an early hour, the patron found Dant\u00e8s leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks, which the rising sun tinged with rosy light. It was the Island of Monte Cristo. _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_ left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for Corsica. Dant\u00e8s thought, as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him, that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land."], "What event is Villefort participating in when he is called away to investigate a Bonapartist plot?": [" Sire, the usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba, to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France. Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France?\u201d \u201cI am, sir,\u201d said the king, much agitated; \u201cand recently we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue Saint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these details?\u201d \u201cSire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this mission was to prepare men\u2019s minds for a return (it is the man who says this, sire)\u2014a return which will soon occur.\u201d \u201cAnd where is this man?\u201d \u201cIn prison, sire.\u201d \u201cAnd the matter seems serious to you?\u201d \u201cSo serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your majesty\u2019s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my devotion.\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d said Louis XVIII., \u201cwas there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-M\u00e9ran?\u201d \u201cDaughter of one of your majesty\u2019s most faithful servants.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.\u201d \u201cSire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.\u201d \u201cA conspiracy in these times,\u201d said Louis XVIII., smiling, \u201cis a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future.", " \u201cYou were wishing just now,\u201d said Villefort, addressing her, \u201cthat I were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in 1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my betrothal.\u201d \u201cAnd wherefore were you called away just now?\u201d asked Mademoiselle de Saint-M\u00e9ran, with an air of deep interest. \u201cFor a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the executioner.\u201d \u201cHow dreadful!\u201d exclaimed Ren\u00e9e, turning pale. \u201cIs it possible?\u201d burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words. \u201cWhy, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered.\u201d \u201cCan I believe my ears?\u201d cried the marquise. \u201cI will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,\u201d said Villefort: \u201c\u2018The king\u2019s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dant\u00e8s, mate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dant\u00e8s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father\u2019s abode.", " But wait a moment, do not let us get angry, or at least not yet. You are irritated and vexed\u2014tell me how this Fernand is related to you?\u201d \u201cHe is merely my father,\u201d said Albert\u2014\u201cM. Fernand Mondego, Count of Morcerf, an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace.\u201d \u201cIs it your father?\u201d said Beauchamp; \u201cthat is quite another thing. Then I can well understand your indignation, my dear Albert. I will look at it again;\u201d and he read the paragraph for the third time, laying a stress on each word as he proceeded. \u201cBut the paper nowhere identifies this Fernand with your father.\u201d 40100m \u201cNo; but the connection will be seen by others, and therefore I will have the article contradicted.\u201d At the words _I will_, Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to Albert\u2019s countenance, and then as gradually lowering them, he remained thoughtful for a few moments. \u201cYou will retract this assertion, will you not, Beauchamp?\u201d said Albert with increased though stifled anger. \u201cYes,\u201d replied Beauchamp. \u201cImmediately?\u201d said Albert. \u201cWhen I am convinced that the statement is false.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cThe thing is worth looking into, and I will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly.\u201d \u201cBut what is there to investigate, sir?\u201d said Albert, enraged beyond measure at Beauchamp\u2019s last remark. \u201cIf you do not believe that it is my father, say so immediately; and if, on the contrary, you believe it to be him, state your reasons for doing so.\u201d Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him, and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind.", " \u201cReally, madame,\u201d he said, \u201cdid I alarm you much?\u201d \u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d she answered; \u201cbut you know, things impress us differently, according to the mood of our minds.\u201d Villefort forced a laugh. \u201cAnd then, you know,\u201d he said, \u201can idea, a supposition, is sufficient.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cyou may believe me if you like, but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house.\u201d \u201cTake care,\u201d said Madame de Villefort, \u201cthe king\u2019s attorney is here.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d replied Monte Cristo, \u201csince that is the case, I will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration.\u201d \u201cYour declaration?\u201d said Villefort. \u201cYes, before witnesses.\u201d \u201cOh, this is very interesting,\u201d said Debray; \u201cif there really has been a crime, we will investigate it.\u201d \u201cThere has been a crime,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cCome this way, gentlemen; come, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made before the competent authorities.\u201d He then took Villefort\u2019s arm, and, at the same time, holding that of Madame Danglars under his own, he dragged the procureur to the plantain-tree, where the shade was thickest. All the other guests followed. \u201cStay,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201chere, in this very spot\u201d (and he stamped upon the ground), \u201cI had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in, to refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging, found a box, or rather, the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant.\u201d 30225m Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen, while that of Villefort trembled."], "Who is Noirtier, the intended recipient of the letter that Dant\u00e8s is carrying?": [" You tell me he burned the letter?\u201d \u201cHe did; saying at the same time, \u2018You see I thus destroy the only proof existing against you.\u2019\u201d \u201cThis action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.\u201d \u201cYou think so?\u201d \u201cI am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?\u201d \u201cTo M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-H\u00e9ron, No. 13, Paris.\u201d \u201cNow can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?\u201d \u201cWhy, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address.\u201d \u201cNoirtier!\u201d repeated the abb\u00e9; \u201cNoirtier!\u2014I knew a person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruria,\u2014a Noirtier, who had been a Girondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?\u201d \u201cDe Villefort!\u201d The abb\u00e9 burst into a fit of laughter, while Dant\u00e8s gazed on him in utter astonishment. \u201cWhat ails you?\u201d said he at length. \u201cDo you see that ray of sunlight?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cWell, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you. Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you?\u201d \u201cHe did.\u201d \u201cAnd the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhy, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed?", " \u201cI am free, then, sir?\u201d cried Dant\u00e8s joyfully. \u201cYes; but first give me this letter.\u201d \u201cYou have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that packet.\u201d \u201cStop a moment,\u201d said the deputy, as Dant\u00e8s took his hat and gloves. \u201cTo whom is it addressed?\u201d _\u201cTo Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-H\u00e9ron, Paris.\u201d_ Had a thunderbolt fallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied.

After reading the letter, Villefort covered his face with his hands. \u201cOh,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s timidly, \u201cwhat is the matter?\u201d Villefort made no answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and again perused the letter. \u201cAnd you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?\u201d \u201cI give you my word of honor, sir,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s; \u201cbut what is the matter? You are ill\u2014shall I ring for assistance?\u2014shall I call?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Villefort, rising hastily; \u201cstay where you are.

Attend to yourself; answer me.\u201d Dant\u00e8s waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter. \u201cOh, if he knows the contents of this!\u201d murmured he, \u201cand that Noirtier is the father of Villefort, I am lost!\u201d And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts. \u201cOh, it is impossible to doubt it,\u201d cried he, suddenly. \u201cIn heaven\u2019s name!\u201d cried the unhappy young man, \u201cif you doubt me, question me; I will answer you.\u201d Villefort made a violent effort, and in a tone he strove to render firm: \u201cSir,\u201d said he, \u201cI am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you immediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial justice; what my own feeling is you already know.\u201d \u201cOh, monsieur,\u201d cried Dant\u00e8s, \u201cyou have been rather a friend than a judge.\u201d 0105m \u201cWell, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it as short as possible.", " It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.\u201d \u201cTalking of Captain Leclere, has not Dant\u00e8s given you a letter from him?\u201d \u201cTo me?\u2014no\u2014was there one?\u201d \u201cI believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care.\u201d \u201cOf what packet are you speaking, Danglars?\u201d \u201cWhy, that which Dant\u00e8s left at Porto-Ferrajo.\u201d \u201cHow do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?\u201d Danglars turned very red. \u201cI was passing close to the door of the captain\u2019s cabin, which was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dant\u00e8s.\u201d \u201cHe did not speak to me of it,\u201d replied the shipowner; \u201cbut if there be any letter he will give it to me.\u201d Danglars reflected for a moment. \u201cThen, M.

Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature.\u201d Dant\u00e8s pressed the gendarme\u2019s hand as though he would crush it. \u201cYou think, then,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I am taken to the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If to be imprisoned there?\u201d \u201cIt is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.\u201d \u201cWithout any inquiry, without any formality?\u201d \u201cAll the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already made.\u201d \u201cAnd so, in spite of M. de Villefort\u2019s promises?\u201d \u201cI do not know what M. de Villefort promised you,\u201d said the gendarme, \u201cbut I know we are taking you to the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If.", " Ratonneau and Pom\u00e8gue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If, but Ratonneau and Pom\u00e8gue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dant\u00e8s\u2019 venture. The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If; Dant\u00e8s, nevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night? At this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him like a star. By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, therefore, he would find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If to this island. Often in prison Faria had said to him, when he saw him idle and inactive: \u201cDant\u00e8s, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned if you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion.\u201d These words rang in Dant\u00e8s\u2019 ears, even beneath the waves; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength. He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy. Fear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dant\u00e8s\u2019 efforts. He listened for any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness.", " \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says.

There were, besides, other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had assured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of recognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If, he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither. 0315m Still Dant\u00e8s could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria, Dant\u00e8s coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation. The first person to attract the attention of Dant\u00e8s, as he landed on the Canebi\u00e8re, was one of the crew belonging to the _Pharaon_."], "After having Dant\u00e8s jailed, who does Villefort rush to Paris to warn of the Bonapartist plot?": [" \u201cYou were wishing just now,\u201d said Villefort, addressing her, \u201cthat I were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in 1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my betrothal.\u201d \u201cAnd wherefore were you called away just now?\u201d asked Mademoiselle de Saint-M\u00e9ran, with an air of deep interest. \u201cFor a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the executioner.\u201d \u201cHow dreadful!\u201d exclaimed Ren\u00e9e, turning pale. \u201cIs it possible?\u201d burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words. \u201cWhy, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered.\u201d \u201cCan I believe my ears?\u201d cried the marquise. \u201cI will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,\u201d said Villefort: \u201c\u2018The king\u2019s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dant\u00e8s, mate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dant\u00e8s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father\u2019s abode.", " Sire, the usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba, to go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France. Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has maintained his relations with Italy and France?\u201d \u201cI am, sir,\u201d said the king, much agitated; \u201cand recently we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue Saint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these details?\u201d \u201cSire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this mission was to prepare men\u2019s minds for a return (it is the man who says this, sire)\u2014a return which will soon occur.\u201d \u201cAnd where is this man?\u201d \u201cIn prison, sire.\u201d \u201cAnd the matter seems serious to you?\u201d \u201cSo serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your majesty\u2019s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my devotion.\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d said Louis XVIII., \u201cwas there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-M\u00e9ran?\u201d \u201cDaughter of one of your majesty\u2019s most faithful servants.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.\u201d \u201cSire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.\u201d \u201cA conspiracy in these times,\u201d said Louis XVIII., smiling, \u201cis a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future.", " \u201cMy name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s,\u201d replied the young man calmly; \u201cI am mate of the _Pharaon_, belonging to Messrs.

When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dant\u00e8s. 0099m \u201cGo on, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cWhat would you have me say?\u201d \u201cGive all the information in your power.\u201d \u201cTell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only,\u201d added he, with a smile, \u201cI warn you I know very little.\u201d \u201cHave you served under the usurper?\u201d \u201cI was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.\u201d \u201cIt is reported your political opinions are extreme,\u201d said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.", " \u201cWell, then, I should say, for instance,\u201d resumed Danglars, \u201cthat if after a voyage such as Dant\u00e8s has just made, in which he touched at the Island of Elba, someone were to denounce him to the king\u2019s procureur as a Bonapartist agent\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI will denounce him!\u201d exclaimed the young man hastily. \u201cYes, but they will make you then sign your declaration, and confront you with him you have denounced; I will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation, for I know the fact well. But Dant\u00e8s cannot remain forever in prison, and one day or other he will leave it, and the day when he comes out, woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration!\u201d \u201cOh, I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me.\u201d \u201cYes, and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s!

Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.\u201d \u201cTrue, Dant\u00e8s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father\u2014the lovely Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.\u201d Dant\u00e8s blushed. \u201cAh, ha,\u201d said the shipowner, \u201cI am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!\u201d \u201cShe is not my mistress,\u201d replied the young sailor, gravely; \u201cshe is my betrothed.\u201d \u201cSometimes one and the same thing,\u201d said Morrel, with a smile. \u201cNot with us, sir,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWell, well, my dear Edmond,\u201d continued the owner, \u201cdon\u2019t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own.

Danglars is his banker, is he not?\u201d asked Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud of Debray. \u201cI believe so,\u201d replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. \u201cBut Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel.\u201d \u201cMorrel? Do they know him?\u201d asked Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud. \u201cI think he has only been introduced to Madame de Villefort.\u201d \u201cStill, he ought to have been here,\u201d said Debray; \u201cI wonder what will be talked about tonight; this funeral is the news of the day. But hush, here comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin,\u201d and the three young men drew near to listen. Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e d\u2019Antin, to M. Danglars\u2019. The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard, and advanced to meet him with a sad, though affable smile. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo, \u201cI suppose you have come to sympathize with me, for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house. When I perceived you, I was just asking myself whether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs, which would have justified the proverb of \u2018He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself.\u2019 Well, on my word of honor, I answered, \u2018No!\u2019 I wished no ill to Morcerf; he was a little proud, perhaps, for a man who like myself has risen from nothing; but we all have our faults."], "What does Dant\u00e8s use to scrape through the wall of the prison to reach his neighbor?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong.

First you break your jug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners followed your example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave you the saucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I hope you will not be so destructive.\u201d Dant\u00e8s raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was a greater reason for proceeding\u2014if his neighbor would not come to him, he would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer\u2019s visit arrived, Dant\u00e8s straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and placed it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it, together with the fish\u2014for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time, had not Dant\u00e8s long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the turnkey retired. Dant\u00e8s wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work.", " Now when evening came Dant\u00e8s put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as he entered, stepped on it and broke it. This time he could not blame Dant\u00e8s. He was wrong to leave it there, but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him. The jailer, therefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something to pour the soup into; Dant\u00e8s\u2019 entire dinner service consisted of one plate\u2014there was no alternative. \u201cLeave the saucepan,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s; \u201cyou can take it away when you bring me my breakfast.\u201d This advice was to the jailer\u2019s taste, as it spared him the necessity of making another trip. He left the saucepan. Dant\u00e8s was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food, and after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and return, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and employed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dant\u00e8s that all went well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall, leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter. Dant\u00e8s carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of his cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work without ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his bed against the wall, and lay down.", " But, hush, here comes somebody.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return.\u201d \u201cAh, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,\u201d murmured Edmond. \u201cBut, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time, so he\u2019s welcome.\u201d As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining. \u201cWhat, is it you, Edmond, back again?\u201d said he, with a broad Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth. \u201cYes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, but ill-concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility. \u201cThanks\u2014thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me.\u201d Dant\u00e8s made a gesture. \u201cI do not allude to you, my boy.

His fear was lest the governor, touched with pity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus separate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the case, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a slight indisposition. During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands, tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness.

Spada turned pale, as C\u00e6sar looked at him with an ironical air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well spread. \u201cThey began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the pope\u2019s butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making signs which his wife could not comprehend. \u201cThen C\u00e6sar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:\u2014\u2018I bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.\u2019 \u201cThe heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was really the most miserable of uncles\u2014no treasures\u2014unless they were those of science, contained in the library and laboratories.", " I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you.\u201d Dant\u00e8s took the hand of the abb\u00e9 in his, and affectionately pressed it.

Dant\u00e8s waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid being seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, sombre and terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures. He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea; doubtless these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry. Dant\u00e8s dived again, and remained a long time beneath the water.

During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands, tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?", " By degrees the wind abated, vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars. Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded their foaming crests with gold. It was day. Dant\u00e8s stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if he now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed. He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and land. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o\u2019clock. The sea continued to get calmer. \u201cIn two or three hours,\u201d thought Dant\u00e8s, \u201cthe turnkey will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I am cold, I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. Oh, my God, I have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what I am unable to do for myself.\u201d As Dant\u00e8s (his eyes turned in the direction of the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If) uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pom\u00e8gue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and with his sailor\u2019s eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan."], "After Dant\u00e8s escapes, what excuse does he make to the Genoese sailors for why his hair/beard are so long?": [" \u201cI am,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, in bad Italian, \u201ca Maltese sailor. We were coming from Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.\u201d \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d \u201cFrom these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your vessel, and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course. You have saved my life, and I thank you,\u201d continued Dant\u00e8s. \u201cI was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair.\u201d \u201cIt was I,\u201d said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; \u201cand it was time, for you were sinking.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d returned Dant\u00e8s, holding out his hand, \u201cI thank you again.\u201d \u201cI almost hesitated, though,\u201d replied the sailor; \u201cyou looked more like a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair a foot long.\u201d Dant\u00e8s recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If. \u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cI made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but today the vow expires.\u201d \u201cNow what are we to do with you?\u201d said the captain. \u201cAlas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely escaped; but I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be sure to find employment.\u201d \u201cDo you know the Mediterranean?\u201d \u201cI have sailed over it since my childhood.\u201d \u201cYou know the best harbors?\u201d \u201cThere are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes.\u201d \u201cI say, captain,\u201d said the sailor who had cried \u201cCourage!\u201d to Dant\u00e8s, \u201cif what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?\u201d \u201cIf he says true,\u201d said the captain doubtingly.", " This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit. Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to \u201cpump\u201d him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe. In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian\u2019s portraits.", " Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present, which Dant\u00e8s hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of Dant\u00e8s gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy. The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_ having expired, Dant\u00e8s took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him further. The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions from Dant\u00e8s to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo. Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dant\u00e8s proceeded to make his final adieus on board _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_, distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all, and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans. Then Dant\u00e8s departed for Genoa. At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs.", " At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work. When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance. Dant\u00e8s had entered the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself."], "Who offers to stay behind with Dant\u00e8s on the Island of Monte Cristo, impressing Dant\u00e8s with his selflessness?": [" \u201cYou are the child of my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.\u201d And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept. Chapter 19. The Third Attack Now that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abb\u00e9\u2019s meditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really loved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he expatiated on the amount, explaining to Dant\u00e8s all the good which, with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days to his friends; and then Dant\u00e8s\u2019 countenance became gloomy, for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected how much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies. The abb\u00e9 did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dant\u00e8s knew it, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dant\u00e8s drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dant\u00e8s advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure.", " One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and lay down, and said to the crew,\u2014\u201cTo the Island of Elba!\u201d The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and re-embarked for Marciana. Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that red partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper. \u201cAh, if your excellency chose,\u201d said the captain, \u201cyou might have capital sport.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cDo you see that island?\u201d continued the captain, pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea. \u201cWell, what is this island?\u201d \u201cThe Island of Monte Cristo.\u201d \u201cBut I have no permission to shoot over this island.\u201d \u201cYour excellency does not require a permit, for the island is uninhabited.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed!\u201d said the young man. \u201cA desert island in the midst of the Mediterranean must be a curiosity.\u201d \u201cIt is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.\u201d \u201cTo whom does this island belong?\u201d \u201cTo Tuscany.\u201d \u201cWhat game shall I find there!\u201d \u201cThousands of wild goats.\u201d \u201cWho live upon the stones, I suppose,\u201d said Franz with an incredulous smile.", " The patron of _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_ proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury, the god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct, but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category. At the mention of Monte Cristo Dant\u00e8s started with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_. When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security, and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly. Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral island by the following day. 0289m Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo Thus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny, Dant\u00e8s was about to secure the opportunity he wished for, by simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring any suspicion.", " \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested."], "After finding the treasure, Dant\u00e8s falls to his knees and thanks ___.": [" I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you.\u201d Dant\u00e8s took the hand of the abb\u00e9 in his, and affectionately pressed it. Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his task, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend. Chapter 18. The Treasure When Dant\u00e8s returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he inquired. \u201cLook at it,\u201d said the abb\u00e9 with a smile. \u201cI have looked at it with all possible attention,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.\u201d \u201cThis paper, my friend,\u201d said Faria, \u201cI may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity\u2014this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.\u201d The sweat started forth on Dant\u00e8s\u2019 brow. Until this day and for how long a time!\u2014he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abb\u00e9 the accusation of madness.", " Two open...ings have been made in these caves; the treasure is in the furthest a...ngle in the second; which treasure I bequeath and leave en...tire to him as my sole heir. \u201c25th April, 1498. \u201cC\u00e6s...ar \u2020 Spada.\u201d \u201cWell, do you comprehend now?\u201d inquired Faria. \u201cIt is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought for,\u201d replied Edmond, still incredulous. \u201cYes; a thousand times, yes!\u201d \u201cAnd who completed it as it now is?\u201d \u201cI did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us.\u201d \u201cAnd what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?\u201d \u201cI resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino. \u201cNow,\u201d continued Faria, addressing Dant\u00e8s with an almost paternal expression, \u201cnow, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d inquired Dant\u00e8s hesitating, \u201chas this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?\u201d \u201cNo, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct.", " With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation. \u201cYour treasure?\u201d stammered Dant\u00e8s. Faria smiled. \u201cYes,\u201d said he. \u201cYou have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dant\u00e8s, and if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes\u2014you. No one would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards if you will.\u201d \u201cAlas,\u201d murmured Edmond to himself, \u201cthis is a terrible relapse! There was only this blow wanting.\u201d Then he said aloud, \u201cMy dear friend, your attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile? Tomorrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but today I wish to nurse you carefully. Besides,\u201d he said, \u201ca treasure is not a thing we need hurry about.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!\u201d replied the old man. \u201cWho knows if tomorrow, or the next day after, the third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes, indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me.", " \u201cYou are the child of my captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you to me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a father, and the prisoner who could not get free.\u201d And Faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man, who threw himself upon his neck and wept.

Will the marquis honor me by a few moments\u2019 private conversation?\u201d \u201cAh, it is really a serious matter, then?\u201d asked the marquis, remarking the cloud on Villefort\u2019s brow. \u201cSo serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,\u201d added he, turning to Ren\u00e9e, \u201cjudge for yourself if it be not important.\u201d \u201cYou are going to leave us?\u201d cried Ren\u00e9e, unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement. \u201cAlas,\u201d returned Villefort, \u201cI must!\u201d \u201cWhere, then, are you going?\u201d asked the marquise. \u201cThat, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions for Paris, a friend of mine is going there tonight, and will with pleasure undertake them.\u201d The guests looked at each other. \u201cYou wish to speak to me alone?\u201d said the marquis. \u201cYes, let us go to the library, please.\u201d The marquis took his arm, and they left the salon. \u201cWell,\u201d asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, \u201ctell me what it is?\u201d \u201cAn affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate presence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you any landed property?\u201d \u201cAll my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand francs.\u201d \u201cThen sell out\u2014sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.\u201d 0123m \u201cBut how can I sell out here?\u201d \u201cYou have a broker, have you not?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an instant\u2019s delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.\u201d \u201cThe deuce you say!\u201d replied the marquis, \u201clet us lose no time, then!\u201d And, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell out at the market price.", " Very well. Holloa, there, some bread!\u201d he called. The youth brought a small loaf. \u201cHow much?\u201d asked Danglars. \u201cFour thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis,\u201d said Peppino; \u201cYou have paid two louis in advance.\u201d 50255m \u201cWhat? One hundred thousand francs for a loaf?\u201d \u201cOne hundred thousand francs,\u201d repeated Peppino. \u201cBut you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!\u201d \u201cWe have a fixed price for all our provisions. It signifies nothing whether you eat much or little\u2014whether you have ten dishes or one\u2014it is always the same price.\u201d \u201cWhat, still keeping up this silly jest? My dear fellow, it is perfectly ridiculous\u2014stupid! You had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death.\u201d \u201cOh, dear, no, your excellency, unless you intend to commit suicide. Pay and eat.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to pay with, brute?\u201d said Danglars, enraged. \u201cDo you suppose I carry 100,000 francs in my pocket?\u201d \u201cYour excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will be fifty fowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the 50,000.\u201d Danglars shuddered. The bandage fell from his eyes, and he understood the joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201cif I pay you the 100,000 francs, will you be satisfied, and allow me to eat at my ease?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Peppino. \u201cBut how can I pay them?\u201d \u201cOh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs. Thomson & French, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these gentlemen, and our banker shall take it.\u201d Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace, so he took the pen, ink, and paper Peppino offered him, wrote the draft, and signed it."], "After giving Jacopo a ship as a gift, what does Dant\u00e8s ask his friend to do in return?": [" \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d said the seaman who had saved Dant\u00e8s; \u201cfor you know more than we do.\u201d \u201cWhat is that to you, Jacopo?\u201d returned the Captain. \u201cEveryone is free to ask what he pleases.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d replied Jacopo; \u201cI only make a remark.\u201d \u201cWell, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers, if you have them.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Jacopo; \u201cbut I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.\u201d \u201cThat is all I want,\u201d interrupted Dant\u00e8s. Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted. \u201cNow, then, do you wish for anything else?\u201d said the patron. \u201cA piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I have not eaten or drunk for a long time.\u201d He had not tasted food for forty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the gourd. \u201cLarboard your helm,\u201d cried the captain to the steersman. Dant\u00e8s glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in mid-air. \u201cHollo! what\u2019s the matter at the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If?\u201d said the captain. A small white cloud, which had attracted Dant\u00e8s\u2019 attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If. At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked the captain. \u201cA prisoner has escaped from the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If, and they are firing the alarm gun,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s. The captain glanced at him, but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure, that suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.", " He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher, \u201cPain, thou art not an evil.\u201d He had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him. Dant\u00e8s was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and rushing towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade. This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither was it so wicked as Dant\u00e8s thought it, since this man, who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall. Fortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly. As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of position\u2014a superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others.", " Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present, which Dant\u00e8s hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of Dant\u00e8s gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy. The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_ having expired, Dant\u00e8s took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him further. The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions from Dant\u00e8s to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo. Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dant\u00e8s proceeded to make his final adieus on board _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_, distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all, and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans. Then Dant\u00e8s departed for Genoa. At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs.", " 0277m \u201cPretty strong rum! \u201c said Dant\u00e8s, wiping his brow with his sleeve. \u201cAt any rate,\u201d murmured he, \u201cif it be, so much the better, for I have made a rare acquisition.\u201d 0279m Under pretence of being fatigued, Dant\u00e8s asked to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade. Dant\u00e8s could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles. \u201cWhat is the day of the month?\u201d asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside him. \u201cThe 28th of February.\u201d \u201cIn what year?\u201d \u201cIn what year\u2014you ask me in what year?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied the young man, \u201cI ask you in what year!\u201d \u201cYou have forgotten then?\u201d \u201cI got such a fright last night,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, smiling, \u201cthat I have almost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?\u201d \u201cThe year 1829,\u201d returned Jacopo. It was fourteen years, day for day, since Dant\u00e8s\u2019 arrest. He was nineteen when he entered the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If; he was thirty-three when he escaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, who must believe him dead. Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity. He renewed against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon. This oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailor in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn."], "What does Dant\u00e8s disguise himself as when he goes to see Caderousse at the Inn of Pont du Gard?": [" But on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present, consisting of an entirely new fishing-boat, with two seines and a tender. The delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor, but they had seen him, upon quitting the hut, merely give some orders to a sailor, and then springing lightly on horseback, leave Marseilles by the Porte d\u2019Aix. Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,\u2014a little nearer to the former than to the latter,\u2014a small roadside inn, from the front of which hung, creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed upon the Rh\u00f4ne. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict. Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.", " I was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse\u2019s tail, and thus they took me to N\u00eemes. \u201cI had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on that morning. \u201cIf Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and there existed no such person as the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, then, indeed, I was lost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth. \u201cTwo months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he would. Caderousse still evaded all pursuit, and I had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate. My trial was to come on at the approaching assizes; when, on the 8th of September\u2014that is to say, precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life\u2014the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I should see, presented himself at the prison doors, saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him; he added, that having learned at Marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened to comply with my desire.", " Then I should become simply No. 106, and good-bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker! No, no, my boy; I prefer remaining honorably in the capital.\u201d Andrea scowled. Certainly, as he had himself owned, the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful fellow. He drew up for a minute, threw a rapid glance around him, and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket, where it began playing with a pistol. But, meanwhile, Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off his companion, passed his hand behind his back, and opened a long Spanish knife, which he always carried with him, to be ready in case of need. The two friends, as we see, were worthy of and understood one another. Andrea\u2019s hand left his pocket inoffensively, and was carried up to the red moustache, which it played with for some time. \u201cGood Caderousse,\u201d he said, \u201chow happy you will be.\u201d \u201cI will do my best,\u201d said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard, shutting up his knife. \u201cWell, then, we will go into Paris. But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion? It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cwe shall see.\u201d He then took the greatcoat with the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury, and put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcanti\u2019s hat, which he placed upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself.", " At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and courteous smiles, the host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to enter. 0319m \u201cYou are welcome, sir, most welcome!\u201d repeated the astonished Caderousse. \u201cNow, then, Margotin,\u201d cried he, speaking to the dog, \u201cwill you be quiet? Pray don\u2019t heed him, sir!\u2014he only barks, he never bites. I make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day.\u201d Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: \u201cA thousand pardons! I really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor roof. What would the abb\u00e9 please to have? What refreshment can I offer? All I have is at his service.\u201d The priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze\u2014there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking with a strong Italian accent, \u201cYou are, I presume, M. Caderousse?\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d answered the host, even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it; \u201cI am Gaspard Caderousse, at your service.\u201d \u201cGaspard Caderousse,\u201d rejoined the priest."], "According to Caderousse, how long after Dant\u00e8s\u2019 imprisonment did Fernand marry Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s?": [" Chapter 4. Conspiracy Danglars followed Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas; then, turning round, he perceived Fernand, who had fallen, pale and trembling, into his chair, while Caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking-song. \u201cWell, my dear sir,\u201d said Danglars to Fernand, \u201chere is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy.\u201d \u201cIt drives me to despair,\u201d said Fernand. \u201cDo you, then, love Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s?\u201d \u201cI adore her!\u201d \u201cFor long?\u201d \u201cAs long as I have known her\u2014always.\u201d \u201cAnd you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy your condition; I did not think that was the way of your people.\u201d \u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d said Fernand. \u201cHow do I know? Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s; but for you\u2014in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall find.\u201d \u201cI have found already.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.\u201d \u201cPooh! Women say those things, but never do them.\u201d \u201cYou do not know Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s; what she threatens she will do.\u201d \u201cIdiot!\u201d muttered Danglars; \u201cwhether she kill herself or not, what matter, provided Dant\u00e8s is not captain?\u201d \u201cBefore Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s should die,\u201d replied Fernand, with the accents of unshaken resolution, \u201cI would die myself!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I call love!\u201d said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever.", " \u201cPoor Fernand has been dismissed,\u201d continued Caderousse. \u201cWell, and what then?\u201d said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger; \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not free to love whomsoever she will?\u201d \u201cOh, if you take it in that sense,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cit is another thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.\u201d Fernand smiled piteously. \u201cA lover is never terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cPoor fellow!\u201d remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart. \u201cWhy, you see, he did not expect to see Dant\u00e8s return so suddenly\u2014he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance faithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly.\u201d \u201cAh, _ma foi_, under any circumstances!\u201d said Caderousse, who drank as he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,\u2014\u201cunder any circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dant\u00e8s; is he, Danglars?\u201d \u201cNo, you are right\u2014and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.\u201d \u201cWell, never mind,\u201d answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while Danglars had merely sipped his.", " \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,\u201d replied Caderousse. \u201cGo on,\u201d said the abb\u00e9; \u201cit seems as if I were listening to the story of a dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.\u201d \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dant\u00e8s. In the midst of her despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of Fernand\u2014of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded as her brother. Fernand went, and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s remained alone. \u201cThree months passed and still she wept\u2014no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair. One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her. \u201cIt was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her. \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s seized Fernand\u2019s hands with a transport which he took for love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow.", " Yet this Catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and Calabrians, and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow. Unquestionably, Edmond\u2019s star is in the ascendant, and he will marry the splendid girl\u2014he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all, unless\u201d\u2014a sinister smile passed over Danglars\u2019 lips\u2014\u201cunless I take a hand in the affair,\u201d he added. \u201cHallo!\u201d continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the table, \u201challo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too proud to speak to them?\u201d \u201cNo, my dear fellow!\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, \u201cI am not proud, but I am happy, and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.\u201d \u201cAh, very well, that\u2019s an explanation!\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cHow do you do, Madame Dant\u00e8s?\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s courtesied gravely, and said\u2014\u201cThat is not my name, and in my country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, if you please.\u201d \u201cWe must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, \u201che is so easily mistaken.\u201d \u201cSo, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M.

Now go.\u201d He made a sign to Cocles, who went first; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear. \u201cNow,\u201d said the owner to his wife and daughter, \u201cleave me; I wish to speak with this gentleman.\u201d 20045m And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson & French, who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene, in which he had taken no part, except the few words we have mentioned. The two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten, and retired; but, as she left the apartment, Julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance, to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features. The two men were left alone. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said Morrel, sinking into a chair, \u201cyou have heard all, and I have nothing further to tell you.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d returned the Englishman, \u201cthat a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you, and this only increases my desire to serve you.\u201d \u201cOh, sir!\u201d cried Morrel. \u201cLet me see,\u201d continued the stranger, \u201cI am one of your largest creditors.\u201d \u201cYour bills, at least, are the first that will fall due.\u201d \u201cDo you wish for time to pay?\u201d \u201cA delay would save my honor, and consequently my life.\u201d \u201cHow long a delay do you wish for?\u201d Morrel reflected.", " Perhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to offer him employment from his new master. \u201cWorthy fellows!\u201d said Morrel, as he went away, \u201cmay your new master love you as I loved you, and be more fortunate than I have been!\u201d 20049m August rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew his credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at Marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that Morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier Cocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when the 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual precision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had fully anticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and then, with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure was put off until the end of September. On the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety, for from this journey to Paris they hoped great things. Morrel had thought of Danglars, who was now immensely rich, and had lain under great obligations to Morrel in former days, since to him it was owing that Danglars entered the service of the Spanish banker, with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth.", " Very well. Holloa, there, some bread!\u201d he called. The youth brought a small loaf. \u201cHow much?\u201d asked Danglars. \u201cFour thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis,\u201d said Peppino; \u201cYou have paid two louis in advance.\u201d 50255m \u201cWhat? One hundred thousand francs for a loaf?\u201d \u201cOne hundred thousand francs,\u201d repeated Peppino. \u201cBut you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!\u201d \u201cWe have a fixed price for all our provisions. It signifies nothing whether you eat much or little\u2014whether you have ten dishes or one\u2014it is always the same price.\u201d \u201cWhat, still keeping up this silly jest? My dear fellow, it is perfectly ridiculous\u2014stupid! You had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to death.\u201d \u201cOh, dear, no, your excellency, unless you intend to commit suicide. Pay and eat.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to pay with, brute?\u201d said Danglars, enraged. \u201cDo you suppose I carry 100,000 francs in my pocket?\u201d \u201cYour excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will be fifty fowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the 50,000.\u201d Danglars shuddered. The bandage fell from his eyes, and he understood the joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, \u201cif I pay you the 100,000 francs, will you be satisfied, and allow me to eat at my ease?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Peppino. \u201cBut how can I pay them?\u201d \u201cOh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs. Thomson & French, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these gentlemen, and our banker shall take it.\u201d Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace, so he took the pen, ink, and paper Peppino offered him, wrote the draft, and signed it.", " And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went. The funeral being over, the guests returned to Paris. Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud looked for a moment for Morrel; but while they were watching the departure of the count, Morrel had quitted his post, and Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, failing in his search, joined Debray and Beauchamp. Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of Morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen. Morrel threw a glance around, but before it reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer, still unperceived. The young man knelt down. The count, with outstretched neck and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon Morrel upon the first occasion. Morrel bent his head till it touched the stone, then clutching the grating with both hands, he murmured: \u201cOh, Valentine!\u201d The count\u2019s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words; he stepped forward, and touching the young man\u2019s shoulder, said: \u201cI was looking for you, my friend.\u201d Monte Cristo expected a burst of passion, but he was deceived, for Morrel turning round, said calmly,\u2014 \u201cYou see I was praying.\u201d The scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot. He then seemed more easy. \u201cShall I drive you back to Paris?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d \u201cDo you wish anything?\u201d \u201cLeave me to pray.\u201d The count withdrew without opposition, but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel, who at length arose, brushed the dust from his knees, and turned towards Paris, without once looking back."], "What alias does Dant\u00e8s use in his letter to Morrel\u2019s daughter, Julie?": [" An instant afterwards the door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth pressed her forehead. She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy. 20053m \u201cMaximilian, my dearest brother!\u201d she cried. At these words Madame Morrel rose, and threw herself into her son\u2019s arms. \u201cMother,\u201d said the young man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter, \u201cwhat has occurred\u2014what has happened? Your letter has frightened me, and I have come hither with all speed.\u201d \u201cJulie,\u201d said Madame Morrel, making a sign to the young man, \u201cgo and tell your father that Maximilian has just arrived.\u201d The young lady rushed out of the apartment, but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand. \u201cAre you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?\u201d inquired the man, with a strong Italian accent. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Julie with hesitation; \u201cwhat is your pleasure? I do not know you.\u201d \u201cRead this letter,\u201d he said, handing it to her. Julie hesitated. \u201cIt concerns the best interests of your father,\u201d said the messenger. The young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly and read: \u201cGo this moment to the All\u00e9es de Meilhan, enter the house No. 15, ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should receive it before eleven o\u2019clock.", " \u201cHe is writing,\u201d she said. They had understood each other without speaking. Madame Morrel looked again through the keyhole, Morrel was writing; but Madame Morrel remarked, what her daughter had not observed, that her husband was writing on stamped paper. The terrible idea that he was writing his will flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet had not strength to utter a word. Next day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever, went into his office as usual, came to his breakfast punctually, and then, after dinner, he placed his daughter beside him, took her head in his arms, and held her for a long time against his bosom. In the evening, Julie told her mother, that although he was apparently so calm, she had noticed that her father\u2019s heart beat violently. The next two days passed in much the same way. On the evening of the 4th of September, M. Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study. Julie trembled at this request, which seemed to her of bad omen. Why did her father ask for this key which she always kept, and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment? The young girl looked at Morrel. \u201cWhat have I done wrong, father,\u201d she said, \u201cthat you should take this key from me?\u201d \u201cNothing, my dear,\u201d replied the unhappy man, the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question,\u2014\u201cnothing, only I want it.\u201d Julie made a pretence to feel for the key. \u201cI must have left it in my room,\u201d she said.", " And she went out, but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult Emmanuel. \u201cDo not give this key to your father,\u201d said he, \u201cand tomorrow morning, if possible, do not quit him for a moment.\u201d She questioned Emmanuel, but he knew nothing, or would not say what he knew. During the night, between the 4th and 5th of September, Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound, and, until three o\u2019clock in the morning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation. It was three o\u2019clock when he threw himself on the bed. The mother and daughter passed the night together. They had expected Maximilian since the previous evening. At eight o\u2019clock in the morning Morrel entered their chamber. He was calm; but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage. They did not dare to ask him how he had slept. Morrel was kinder to his wife, more affectionate to his daughter, than he had ever been. He could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl. Julie, mindful of Emmanuel\u2019s request, was following her father when he quitted the room, but he said to her quickly: \u201cRemain with your mother, dearest.\u201d Julie wished to accompany him. \u201cI wish you to do so,\u201d said he. This was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey. She remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless.", " This was Julie, who had become, as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had predicted, Madame Emmanuel Herbault. She uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger, and Maximilian began to laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t disturb yourself, Julie,\u201d said he. \u201cThe count has only been two or three days in Paris, but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the Marais is, and if he does not, you will show him.\u201d \u201cAh, monsieur,\u201d returned Julie, \u201cit is treason in my brother to bring you thus, but he never has any regard for his poor sister. Penelon, Penelon!\u201d An old man, who was digging busily at one of the beds, stuck his spade in the earth, and approached, cap in hand, striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek. A few locks of gray mingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics. \u201cI think you hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?\u201d said he. Penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master\u2019s daughter \u201cMademoiselle Julie,\u201d and had never been able to change the name to Madame Herbault. \u201cPenelon,\u201d replied Julie, \u201cgo and inform M. Emmanuel of this gentleman\u2019s visit, and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon.\u201d Then, turning to Monte Cristo,\u2014\u201cI hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes,\u201d continued she; and without awaiting any reply, disappeared behind a clump of trees, and escaped to the house by a lateral alley."], "In addition to his paid debt notes, what does Morrel\u2019s daughter find in the red silk purse?": [" Suddenly he heard a cry\u2014it was his daughter\u2019s voice. He turned and saw Julie. The pistol fell from his hands. \u201cMy father!\u201d cried the young girl, out of breath, and half dead with joy\u2014\u201csaved, you are saved!\u201d And she threw herself into his arms, holding in her extended hand a red, netted silk purse. 20061m \u201cSaved, my child!\u201d said Morrel; \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cYes, saved\u2014saved! See, see!\u201d said the young girl. Morrel took the purse, and started as he did so, for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself. At one end was the receipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of parchment: _Julie\u2019s Dowry_. Morrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream. At this moment the clock struck eleven. He felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart. \u201cExplain, my child,\u201d he said, \u201cExplain, my child,\u201d he said, \u201cexplain\u2014where did you find this purse?\u201d \u201cIn a house in the All\u00e9es de Meilhan, No. 15, on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d cried Morrel, \u201cthis purse is not yours!\u201d Julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning. \u201cAnd did you go alone?\u201d asked Morrel, after he had read it. \u201cEmmanuel accompanied me, father. He was to have waited for me at the corner of the Rue du Mus\u00e9e, but, strange to say, he was not there when I returned.\u201d \u201cMonsieur Morrel!\u201d exclaimed a voice on the stairs; \u201cMonsieur Morrel!\u201d \u201cIt is his voice!\u201d said Julie.", " Edmond had one friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.\u201d 0351m \u201cOh, sir,\u201d said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,\u2014\u201cOh, sir, do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.\u201d \u201cI know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange\u2014\u2014\u201d Caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand. The abb\u00e9 smiled. \u201cIn exchange,\u201d he continued, \u201cgive me the red silk purse that M. Morrel left on old Dant\u00e8s\u2019 chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in your hands.\u201d Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abb\u00e9 a long purse of faded red silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The abb\u00e9 took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond. \u201cOh, you are a man of God, sir,\u201d cried Caderousse; \u201cfor no one knew that Edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.\u201d \u201cWhich,\u201d said the abb\u00e9 to himself, \u201cyou would have done.\u201d The abb\u00e9 rose, took his hat and gloves. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201call you have told me is perfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.\u201d \u201cSee, sir,\u201d replied Caderousse, \u201cin this corner is a crucifix in holy wood\u2014here on this shelf is my wife\u2019s testament; open this book, and I will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix.", " \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, \u201cyou have spoken unreservedly; and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, Edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.\u201d \u201cHe did not know,\u201d said the abb\u00e9. \u201cBut he knows it all now,\u201d interrupted Caderousse; \u201cthey say the dead know everything.\u201d There was a brief silence; the abb\u00e9 rose and paced up and down pensively, and then resumed his seat. \u201cYou have two or three times mentioned a M.

Twenty times he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote, implored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told you, he came to see Dant\u00e8s\u2019 father, and offered to receive him in his own house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old man\u2019s debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmond\u2019s father died, as he had lived, without doing harm to anyone. I have the purse still by me\u2014a large one, made of red silk.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d asked the abb\u00e9, \u201cis M.

He traversed the island, after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and re-embarked for Marciana. Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that red partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper. \u201cAh, if your excellency chose,\u201d said the captain, \u201cyou might have capital sport.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cDo you see that island?\u201d continued the captain, pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea. \u201cWell, what is this island?\u201d \u201cThe Island of Monte Cristo.\u201d \u201cBut I have no permission to shoot over this island.\u201d \u201cYour excellency does not require a permit, for the island is uninhabited.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed!\u201d said the young man. \u201cA desert island in the midst of the Mediterranean must be a curiosity.\u201d \u201cIt is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.\u201d \u201cTo whom does this island belong?\u201d \u201cTo Tuscany.\u201d \u201cWhat game shall I find there!\u201d \u201cThousands of wild goats.\u201d \u201cWho live upon the stones, I suppose,\u201d said Franz with an incredulous smile.", " The patron of _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_ proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury, the god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct, but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category. At the mention of Monte Cristo Dant\u00e8s started with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_. When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security, and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly. Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral island by the following day. 0289m Chapter 23.

It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown, with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury. He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and Fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals; but which, mere copies as they were, seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling. The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the room. With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair, covered with white satin embroidered with gold. The count sat down. 20335m \u201cI have the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo.\u201d The count bowed. \u201cAnd I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the Legion of Honor, and member of the Chamber of Deputies?\u201d Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron\u2019s card.

Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay,\u201d said the count; \u201cis he not the son of General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d\u2019\u00c9pinay by Charles X.?\u201d \u201cThe same,\u201d said Villefort. \u201cWell, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.\u201d \u201cHe is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in their affection,\u201d said Madame de Villefort. \u201cBut,\u201d said Monte Cristo \u201cdo you not know any cause for this hatred?\u201d \u201cAh, _ma foi!_ who is to know?\u201d \u201cPerhaps it is some political difference?\u201d \u201cMy father and the Baron d\u2019\u00c9pinay lived in the stormy times of which I only saw the ending,\u201d said Villefort."], "Viscount Albert de Morcerf is the son of which character?": [" But do you wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so many questions?\u201d \u201c_Ma foi_,\u201d said Danglars, \u201cit would not be a bad speculation, I fancy, and you know I am a speculator.\u201d \u201cYou are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?\u201d \u201cAlbert,\u201d repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; \u201cah, well; he would care very little about it, I think.\u201d \u201cBut he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?\u201d \u201cWell, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame de Morcerf and Albert\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cYou do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?\u201d \u201cIndeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de Morcerf.\u201d \u201cMademoiselle Danglars\u2019 fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes.\u201d \u201cOh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWhy did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?\u201d \u201cI did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Danglars, laughing, \u201cit would do her a great deal of good.\u201d \u201cWhy so?\u201d \u201cBecause it is the air she always breathed in her youth.\u201d Monte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark. \u201cBut still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,\u201d said the count, \u201cyou must allow that he has a fine name?\u201d \u201cSo he has; but I like mine as well.\u201d \u201cCertainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years.\u201d \u201cAnd for this very reason,\u201d said Danglars with a smile, which he tried to make sardonic, \u201cI prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M. Albert de Morcerf.\u201d \u201cStill, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti?\u201d \u201cThe Morcerfs!\u2014Stay, my dear count,\u201d said Danglars; \u201cyou are a man of the world, are you not?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d \u201cAnd you understand heraldry?\u201d \u201cA little.\u201d \u201cWell, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerf\u2019s.\u201d \u201cWhy so?\u201d \u201cBecause, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at least, Danglars.\u201d \u201cWell, what then?\u201d \u201cWhile his name is not Morcerf.\u201d \u201cHow?\u2014not Morcerf?\u201d \u201cNot the least in the world.\u201d \u201cGo on.\u201d \u201cI have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made himself a count, so that he is not one at all.\u201d \u201cImpossible!\u201d \u201cListen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather my acquaintance, during the last thirty years.", " The count went out first, then Albert. Franz paused for a moment. \u201cHas your excellency anything to ask me?\u201d said Vampa with a smile. \u201cYes, I have,\u201d replied Franz; \u201cI am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered.\u201d \u201cC\u00e6sar\u2019s _Commentaries_,\u201d said the bandit, \u201cit is my favorite work.\u201d \u201cWell, are you coming?\u201d asked Albert. \u201cYes,\u201d replied Franz, \u201chere I am,\u201d and he, in his turn, left the caves. They advanced to the plain. \u201cAh, your pardon,\u201d said Albert, turning round; \u201cwill you allow me, captain?\u201d And he lighted his cigar at Vampa\u2019s torch. \u201cNow, my dear count,\u201d he said, \u201clet us on with all the speed we may. I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Bracciano\u2019s.\u201d They found the carriage where they had left it. The count said a word in Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed. It was just two o\u2019clock by Albert\u2019s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they entered together, all uneasiness on Albert\u2019s account ceased instantly. \u201cMadame,\u201d said the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the countess, \u201cyesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; I am rather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend, whose character for veracity you well know, and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine.\u201d And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz, Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess, and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers.", " Still, in spite of all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage.\u201d \u201cHe is a philanthropist,\u201d answered the other; \u201cand no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity. If my vote and interest can obtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other. And now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else. Come, shall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter\u2019s?\u201d Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five o\u2019clock, the young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay to pass a fortnight at Venice. But, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Viscount Albert de Morcerf, he had written in pencil: \u201c27, _Rue du Helder, on the_ 21_st May, half-past ten_ A.M.\u201d Chapter 39. The Guests In the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite another building, in which were the servants\u2019 apartments.", " \u201c_Diable!_\u201d said Morcerf. \u201cWhat would you have, my dear viscount?\u201d said Monte Cristo, wiping his hands on the towel which Ali had brought him; \u201cI must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other. But come, I am waiting for you.\u201d Both men entered Monte Cristo\u2019s carriage, which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at No. 30. Monte Cristo took Albert into his study, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself. \u201cNow let us talk the matter over quietly,\u201d said the count. \u201cYou see I am perfectly composed,\u201d said Albert. \u201cWith whom are you going to fight?\u201d \u201cWith Beauchamp.\u201d \u201cOne of your friends!\u201d \u201cOf course; it is always with friends that one fights.\u201d \u201cI suppose you have some cause of quarrel?\u201d \u201cI have.\u201d 40094m \u201cWhat has he done to you?\u201d \u201cThere appeared in his journal last night\u2014but wait, and read for yourself.\u201d And Albert handed over the paper to the count, who read as follows: \u201cA correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance. The castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand, in whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest confidence.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cwhat do you see in that to annoy you?\u201d \u201cWhat do I see in it?\u201d \u201cYes; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up by a French officer?\u201d \u201cIt signifies to my father, the Count of Morcerf, whose Christian name is Fernand!\u201d \u201cDid your father serve under Ali Pasha?\u201d \u201cYes; that is to say, he fought for the independence of the Greeks, and hence arises the calumny.\u201d \u201cOh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!\u201d \u201cI do not desire to do otherwise.\u201d \u201cNow, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer Fernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person?"], "Albert de Morcert and Franz d\u2019Epinay are in Rome to attend a carnival that precedes which religious holiday?": [" \u201cWell,\u201d said Franz to Albert, \u201cdo you know what is the best thing we can do? It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.\u201d \u201cAh, the devil, no,\u201d cried Albert; \u201cI came to Rome to see the Carnival, and I will, though I see it on stilts.\u201d \u201cBravo! an excellent idea. We will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete success.\u201d \u201cDo your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday morning?\u201d \u201c_Parbleu!_\u201d said Albert, \u201cdo you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome, like lawyers\u2019 clerks?\u201d \u201cI hasten to comply with your excellencies\u2019 wishes; only, I tell you beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.\u201d \u201cAnd, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next apartments,\u201d said Franz, \u201cI warn you, that as I have been four times before at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you will make a good profit.\u201d \u201cBut, excellency\u201d\u2014said Pastrini, still striving to gain his point. \u201cNow go,\u201d returned Franz, \u201cor I shall go myself and bargain with your _affettatore_, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out of me, he will take a less price than the one I offer you; you will lose the preference, and that will be your fault.\u201d \u201cDo not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,\u201d returned Signor Pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he confesses defeat; \u201cI will do all I can, and I hope you will be satisfied.\u201d \u201cAnd now we understand each other.\u201d \u201cWhen do you wish the carriage to be here?\u201d \u201cIn an hour.\u201d \u201cIn an hour it will be at the door.\u201d An hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the Carnival.", " As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Cristo. He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto; he consequently despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being ready, he hastened on board, and they were soon under way. At the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht, as it disappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio. With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night; and then supper, Sinbad, hashish, statues,\u2014all became a dream for Franz. The boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the sun rose, they had lost sight of Monte Cristo. When Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot, for the moment at least, the events which had just passed, while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence, and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion, who was awaiting him at Rome. He set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mail-coach. An apartment, as we have said, had been retained beforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini\u2019s hotel. But this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with people, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great events in every year,\u2014the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the Feast of St. Peter. All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy, between life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next\u2014a sublime spot, a resting-place full of poetry and character, and at which Franz had already halted five or six times, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking.", " At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound. This time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half fainting, into a seat. Albert, with his eyes closed, was standing grasping the window-curtains. The count was erect and triumphant, like the Avenging Angel! Chapter 36. The Carnival at Rome When Franz recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of water, of which, to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need; and the count, who was assuming his masquerade costume. He glanced mechanically towards the piazza\u2014the scene was wholly changed; scaffold, executioners, victims, all had disappeared; only the people remained, full of noise and excitement. The bell of Monte Citorio, which only sounds on the pope\u2019s decease and the opening of the Carnival, was ringing a joyous peal. \u201cWell,\u201d asked he of the count, \u201cwhat has, then, happened?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the count; \u201conly, as you see, the Carnival has commenced. Make haste and dress yourself.\u201d \u201cIn fact,\u201d said Franz, \u201cthis horrible scene has passed away like a dream.\u201d \u201cIt is but a dream, a nightmare, that has disturbed you.\u201d \u201cYes, that I have suffered; but the culprit?\u201d \u201cThat is a dream also; only he has remained asleep, while you have awakened; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate?\u201d \u201cBut Peppino\u2014what has become of him?\u201d \u201cPeppino is a lad of sense, who, unlike most men, who are happy in proportion as they are noticed, was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion.", " I have been Heaven\u2019s substitute to recompense the good\u2014now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!\u201d At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal, the yacht instantly put out to sea. Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor Towards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the first society of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy, should act as _cicerone_ to Albert. As it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome, especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del Popolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the proprietor of the H\u00f4tel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve comfortable apartments for them. Signor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem. They accepted his offer; but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples. As for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a fancy into his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of Bonaparte) to visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon."], "Who is Luigi Vampa?": [" \u201c\u2018Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,\u2019 said the sentinel. \u201c\u2018What has he to say?\u2019 inquired the young man who was in command in the chief\u2019s absence. \u201c\u2018I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd\u2019s life,\u2019 was Vampa\u2019s reply. \u201c\u2018Ah, I understand,\u2019 said the lieutenant; \u2018and you seek admittance into our ranks?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Welcome!\u2019 cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa. \u201c\u2018Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And what may that be?\u2019 inquired the bandits with astonishment. \u201c\u2018I come to ask to be your captain,\u2019 said the young man. \u201cThe bandits shouted with laughter. \u201c\u2018And what have you done to aspire to this honor?\u2019 demanded the lieutenant. \u201c\u2018I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my betrothed.\u2019 \u201cAn hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto, deceased.\u201d 20129m \u201cWell, my dear Albert,\u201d said Franz, turning towards his friend; \u201cwhat think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?\u201d \u201cI say he is a myth,\u201d replied Albert, \u201cand never had an existence.\u201d \u201cAnd what may a myth be?\u201d inquired Pastrini. \u201cThe explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,\u201d replied Franz. \u201cAnd you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome?\u201d \u201cAnd with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example.\u201d \u201cThen the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?\u201d \u201cWhy, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.", " \u201cThe next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in high spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so cheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion. \u201cLuigi took her arm beneath his own, and led her to the door of the grotto. Then he paused. The young girl, perceiving that there was something extraordinary, looked at him steadfastly. \u201c\u2018Teresa,\u2019 said Luigi, \u2018yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the count\u2019s daughter.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied Teresa with astonishment; \u2018but I was mad to utter such a wish.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And I replied, \u201cVery well, you shall have it.\u201d\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the young girl, whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi, \u2018but of course your reply was only to please me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,\u2019 said Luigi proudly. \u2018Go into the grotto and dress yourself.\u2019 \u201cAt these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto, lighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume.", " \u201cSuddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at Vampa. \u201c\u2018Not another step,\u2019 he said, \u2018or you are a dead man.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What, then,\u2019 said Vampa, raising his hand with a gesture of disdain, while Teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm, clung closely to him, \u2018do wolves rend each other?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Who are you?\u2019 inquired the sentinel. \u201c\u2018I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of the San-Felice farm.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What do you want?\u2019 \u201c\u2018I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at Rocca Bianca.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Follow me, then,\u2019 said the sentinel; \u2018or, as you know your way, go first.\u2019 \u201cVampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit, went before Teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop. The two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal. \u201c\u2018Good!\u2019 said the sentry, \u2018you may now go on.\u2019 \u201cLuigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top of a small mountain, which no doubt in former days had been a volcano\u2014an extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had deserted Alba to come and found the city of Rome. \u201cTeresa and Luigi reached the summit, and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits.", " \u201cTeresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into a dressing-room. \u201cLuigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road, and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him. \u201cLuigi was not mistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways, and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route, he begged Luigi to be his guide. \u201cLuigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep up with. In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross-roads. On arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an emperor, he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow. \u201c\u2018That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again mistake.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And here is your recompense,\u2019 said the traveller, offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money."], "According to the Roman hotel owner, which lost traveler gave Luigi Vampa two small jewels in exchange for directions?": [" \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the brigadier; \u2018and as his head is valued at a thousand Roman crowns, there would have been five hundred for you, if you had helped us to catch him.\u2019 The two young persons exchanged looks. The brigadier had a moment\u2019s hope. Five hundred Roman crowns are three thousand lire, and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married. \u201c\u2018Yes, it is very annoying,\u2019 said Vampa; \u2018but we have not seen him.\u2019 \u201cThen the carbineers scoured the country in different directions, but in vain; then, after a time, they disappeared. Vampa then removed the stone, and Cucumetto came out. Through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and guessed the subject of their parley. He had read in the countenances of Luigi and Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him, and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold, which he offered to them. But Vampa raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold. \u201cCucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing several times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors. \u201cSeveral days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto.", " \u201c\u2018Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,\u2019 said the sentinel. \u201c\u2018What has he to say?\u2019 inquired the young man who was in command in the chief\u2019s absence. \u201c\u2018I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd\u2019s life,\u2019 was Vampa\u2019s reply. \u201c\u2018Ah, I understand,\u2019 said the lieutenant; \u2018and you seek admittance into our ranks?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Welcome!\u2019 cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa. \u201c\u2018Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And what may that be?\u2019 inquired the bandits with astonishment. \u201c\u2018I come to ask to be your captain,\u2019 said the young man. \u201cThe bandits shouted with laughter. \u201c\u2018And what have you done to aspire to this honor?\u2019 demanded the lieutenant. \u201c\u2018I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my betrothed.\u2019 \u201cAn hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto, deceased.\u201d 20129m \u201cWell, my dear Albert,\u201d said Franz, turning towards his friend; \u201cwhat think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?\u201d \u201cI say he is a myth,\u201d replied Albert, \u201cand never had an existence.\u201d \u201cAnd what may a myth be?\u201d inquired Pastrini. \u201cThe explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,\u201d replied Franz. \u201cAnd you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome?\u201d \u201cAnd with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example.\u201d \u201cThen the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?\u201d \u201cWhy, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.", " \u201cThe next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in high spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so cheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion. \u201cLuigi took her arm beneath his own, and led her to the door of the grotto. Then he paused. The young girl, perceiving that there was something extraordinary, looked at him steadfastly. \u201c\u2018Teresa,\u2019 said Luigi, \u2018yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the count\u2019s daughter.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied Teresa with astonishment; \u2018but I was mad to utter such a wish.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And I replied, \u201cVery well, you shall have it.\u201d\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the young girl, whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi, \u2018but of course your reply was only to please me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,\u2019 said Luigi proudly. \u2018Go into the grotto and dress yourself.\u2019 \u201cAt these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto, lighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume.", " \u201cTeresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into a dressing-room. \u201cLuigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road, and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him. \u201cLuigi was not mistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways, and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route, he begged Luigi to be his guide. \u201cLuigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep up with. In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross-roads. On arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an emperor, he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow. \u201c\u2018That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again mistake.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And here is your recompense,\u2019 said the traveller, offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money."], "At which Roman landmark does Franz overhear a conversation between Dant\u00e8s and Luigi Vampa?": [" \u201c\u2018Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,\u2019 said the sentinel. \u201c\u2018What has he to say?\u2019 inquired the young man who was in command in the chief\u2019s absence. \u201c\u2018I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd\u2019s life,\u2019 was Vampa\u2019s reply. \u201c\u2018Ah, I understand,\u2019 said the lieutenant; \u2018and you seek admittance into our ranks?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Welcome!\u2019 cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa. \u201c\u2018Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And what may that be?\u2019 inquired the bandits with astonishment. \u201c\u2018I come to ask to be your captain,\u2019 said the young man. \u201cThe bandits shouted with laughter. \u201c\u2018And what have you done to aspire to this honor?\u2019 demanded the lieutenant. \u201c\u2018I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my betrothed.\u2019 \u201cAn hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto, deceased.\u201d 20129m \u201cWell, my dear Albert,\u201d said Franz, turning towards his friend; \u201cwhat think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?\u201d \u201cI say he is a myth,\u201d replied Albert, \u201cand never had an existence.\u201d \u201cAnd what may a myth be?\u201d inquired Pastrini. \u201cThe explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,\u201d replied Franz. \u201cAnd you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome?\u201d \u201cAnd with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example.\u201d \u201cThen the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?\u201d \u201cWhy, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.", " Well,\u201d continued the count, in a tone that made Franz shudder, \u201cthis young gentleman is one of _my friends_\u2014this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself\u2014this young gentleman has been up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and yet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him hither, and,\u201d added the count, taking the letter from his pocket, \u201cyou have set a ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger.\u201d \u201cWhy did you not tell me all this\u2014you?\u201d inquired the brigand chief, turning towards his men, who all retreated before his look. \u201cWhy have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count, who has all our lives in his hands?

Come, your excellency,\u201d the count added, turning to Franz, \u201chere is Luigi Vampa, who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed.\u201d Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet him. \u201cWelcome among us, your excellency,\u201d he said to him; \u201cyou heard what the count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend\u2019s ransom, that this had happened.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said Franz, looking round him uneasily, \u201cwhere is the viscount?\u2014I do not see him.\u201d \u201cNothing has happened to him, I hope,\u201d said the count frowningly.", " \u201cWell, Signor Pastrini,\u201d said Franz, \u201cnow that my companion is quieted, and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this Luigi Vampa.

Twelve hours\u2019 delay was all that was granted\u2014that is, until nine the next morning. The instant the letter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the plain to find a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock. The natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy undertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an hour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the joyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye vainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among them. \u201cHe inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of laughter. A cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on end. He repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a glass filled with Orvietto, saying, \u2018To the health of the brave Cucumetto and the fair Rita.\u2019 At this moment Carlini heard a woman\u2019s cry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face of him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came.", " The bandit\u2019s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings.

The young girl\u2019s lover was in Cucumetto\u2019s troop; his name was Carlini. When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms to him, and believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a favorite with Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served him, and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down, he hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took Cucumetto one side, while the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest, made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits. There he told the chief all\u2014his affection for the prisoner, their promises of mutual fidelity, and how every night, since he had been near, they had met in some neighboring ruins. 20109m \u201cIt so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a village, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.", " Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take him\u2014we bring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who asks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage, and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and proclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their country.\u201d Whilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini\u2019s face assumed an expression impossible to describe. \u201cAnd pray,\u201d asked Franz, \u201cwhere are these pistols, blunderbusses, and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?\u201d \u201cNot out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my hunting-knife.

Now, then, let us breakfast.\u201d \u201cWith what an air he says all this,\u201d muttered Beauchamp; \u201cdecidedly he is a great man.\u201d \u201cA great man in his own country,\u201d added Debray. \u201cA great man in every country, M. Debray,\u201d said Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud. The count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest. Albert remarked this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point. \u201cMy dear count,\u201d said he, \u201cI fear one thing, and that is, that the fare of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza di Spagna."], "What happens when Monte Cristo is introduced to Albert\u2019s mother?": [" Albert saw all these preparations and understood them, and exclaiming, \u201cMy mother!\u201d he threw his arms around her neck. The artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture. All these proofs of an energetic resolution, which Albert did not fear on his own account, alarmed him for his mother. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked he. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d replied she. \u201cOh, my mother!\u201d exclaimed Albert, so overcome he could scarcely speak; \u201cit is not the same with you and me\u2014you cannot have made the same resolution I have, for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your house, and\u2014and to you.\u201d \u201cI also,\u201d replied Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, \u201cam going, and I acknowledge I had depended on your accompanying me; have I deceived myself?\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d said Albert with firmness. \u201cI cannot make you share the fate I have planned for myself. I must live henceforth without rank and fortune, and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a friend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned one. So, my dear mother, I am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require to supply my present wants.\u201d \u201cYou, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger? Oh, do not say so; it will break my resolutions.\u201d \u201cBut not mine, mother,\u201d replied Albert. \u201cI am young and strong; I believe I am courageous, and since yesterday I have learned the power of will.", " In addition to this, everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection. Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert\u2019s wish to be introduced to Hayd\u00e9e, and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Hayd\u00e9e\u2019s recital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf\u2019s father). Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father\u2019s name before Hayd\u00e9e? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father\u2019s enemies. Albert took Beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him. \u201cYou are right,\u201d said the latter; \u201cM. Danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair, and it is of M. de Monte Cristo that you must demand an explanation.\u201d Albert turned. \u201cSir,\u201d said he to Danglars, \u201cunderstand that I do not take a final leave of you; I must ascertain if your insinuations are just, and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo.\u201d He bowed to the banker, and went out with Beauchamp, without appearing to notice Cavalcanti. Danglars accompanied him to the door, where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the Count of Morcerf.", " Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother\u2019s bed. It was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker. \u201cMy dear mother,\u201d said he, \u201cdo you know if M. de Morcerf has any enemy?\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s started; she noticed that the young man did not say \u201cmy father.\u201d \u201cMy son,\u201d she said, \u201cpersons in the count\u2019s situation have many secret enemies. Those who are known are not the most dangerous.\u201d \u201cI know it, and appeal to your penetration. You are of so superior a mind, nothing escapes you.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d \u201cBecause, for instance, you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave, that M. de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house.\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s raised herself on her feverish arm. \u201cM. de Monte Cristo!\u201d she exclaimed; \u201cand how is he connected with the question you asked me?\u201d 40219m \u201cYou know, mother, M. de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental, and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies.\u201d \u201cDo you say M. de Monte Cristo is our enemy?\u201d replied Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, becoming paler than the sheet which covered her. \u201cWho told you so? Why, you are mad, Albert! M. de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness. M. de Monte Cristo saved your life; you yourself presented him to us. Oh, I entreat you, my son, if you had entertained such an idea, dispel it; and my counsel to you\u2014nay, my prayer\u2014is to retain his friendship.\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d replied the young man, \u201cyou have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man.\u201d \u201cI?\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale, and again becoming paler than ever.", " \u201cIf you like,\u201d replied the latter. Albert could not understand the banker\u2019s look, and turning to Monte Cristo, who understood it perfectly,\u2014\u201cDid you see,\u201d said he, \u201chow he looked at me?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the count; \u201cbut did you think there was anything particular in his look?\u201d \u201cIndeed, I did; and what does he mean by his news from Greece?\u201d \u201cHow can I tell you?\u201d \u201cBecause I imagine you have correspondents in that country.\u201d Monte Cristo smiled significantly. \u201cStop,\u201d said Albert, \u201chere he comes. I shall compliment Mademoiselle Danglars on her cameo, while the father talks to you.\u201d \u201cIf you compliment her at all, let it be on her voice, at least,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cNo, everyone would do that.\u201d \u201cMy dear viscount, you are dreadfully impertinent.\u201d Albert advanced towards Eug\u00e9nie, smiling. Meanwhile, Danglars, stooping to Monte Cristo\u2019s ear, \u201cYour advice was excellent,\u201d said he; \u201cthere is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yanina.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cYes, I will tell you all; but take away the young man; I cannot endure his presence.\u201d \u201cHe is going with me. Shall I send the father to you?\u201d \u201cImmediately.\u201d \u201cVery well.\u201d The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to the ladies, and took their leave, Albert perfectly indifferent to Mademoiselle Danglars\u2019 contempt, Monte Cristo reiterating his advice to Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker\u2019s wife should exercise in providing for the future."], "Where does Monte Cristo purchase a summer home?": [" This was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen\u2019s coachmen on a cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door. Contrary to custom, this gentleman had not been watched, for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank, and one who would allow no impertinent interference, his _incognito_ was strictly respected. His visits were tolerably regular, though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time, but generally, both in summer and winter, he took possession of his apartment about four o\u2019clock, though he never spent the night there. At half-past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence of the little apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour. At four o\u2019clock, as we have already stated, the mysterious personage arrived. Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house, a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress, and always thickly veiled; she passed like a shadow through the lodge, and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot. No one ever asked her where she was going. Her face, therefore, like that of the gentleman, was perfectly unknown to the two concierges, who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion.", " \u201cIt is the first time he has ever been in Paris. He is black, and cannot speak,\u201d returned Monte Cristo. \u201cIt is Ali!\u201d cried Albert, in the midst of the general surprise. \u201cYes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Morcerf; \u201cI recollect him perfectly. But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?\u2014he will do everything wrong.\u201d \u201cUndeceive yourself, monsieur,\u201d replied Monte Cristo; \u201cI am quite sure, that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish. He knows my tastes, my caprices, my wants. He has been here a week, with the instinct of a hound, hunting by himself. He will arrange everything for me. He knew, that I should arrive today at ten o\u2019clock; he was waiting for me at nine at the Barri\u00e8re de Fontainebleau. He gave me this paper; it contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself,\u201d and Monte Cristo passed a paper to Albert. \u201cAh, that is really original,\u201d said Beauchamp. \u201cAnd very princely,\u201d added Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud. \u201cWhat, do you not know your house?\u201d asked Debray. \u201cNo,\u201d said Monte Cristo; \u201cI told you I did not wish to be behind my time; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscount\u2019s door.\u201d The young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was a comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false\u2014besides, why should he tell a falsehood?", " \u201cAnd the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house?\u201d \u201cYour excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best engraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The first card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e d\u2019Antin, No. 7; the others are on the mantle-piece of your excellency\u2019s bedroom.\u201d \u201cGood; what o\u2019clock is it?\u201d \u201cFour o\u2019clock.\u201d Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same French footman who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf\u2019s, and then he passed into the small salon, preceded by Bertuccio, who showed him the way. \u201cThese are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cI trust all this will soon be taken away.\u201d Bertuccio bowed. As the steward had said, the notary awaited him in the small salon. He was a simple-looking lawyer\u2019s clerk, elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener. \u201cYou are the notary empowered to sell the country house that I wish to purchase, monsieur?\u201d asked Monte Cristo. \u201cYes, count,\u201d returned the notary. \u201cIs the deed of sale ready?\u201d \u201cYes, count.\u201d \u201cHave you brought it?\u201d \u201cHere it is.\u201d \u201cVery well; and where is this house that I purchase?\u201d asked the count carelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the notary. The steward made a gesture that signified, \u201cI do not know.\u201d The notary looked at the count with astonishment.", " \u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201cdoes not the count know where the house he purchases is situated?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d returned the count. \u201cThe count does not know?\u201d \u201cHow should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have never before been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even set my foot in France.\u201d \u201cAh, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil.\u201d At these words Bertuccio turned pale. \u201cAnd where is Auteuil?\u201d asked the count. \u201cClose by here, monsieur,\u201d replied the notary\u2014\u201ca little beyond Passy; a charming situation, in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne.\u201d \u201cSo near as that?\u201d said the Count; \u201cbut that is not in the country. What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M. Bertuccio?\u201d \u201cI,\u201d cried the steward with a strange expression. \u201cHis excellency did not charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency will recollect\u2014if he will think\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cAh, true,\u201d observed Monte Cristo; \u201cI recollect now. I read the advertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false title, \u2018a country house.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt is not yet too late,\u201d cried Bertuccio, eagerly; \u201cand if your excellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a better at Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d returned Monte Cristo negligently; \u201csince I have this, I will keep it.\u201d \u201cAnd you are quite right,\u201d said the notary, who feared to lose his fee. \u201cIt is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water and fine trees; a comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long time, without reckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet valuable, now that old things are so much sought after."], "Who caught Villefort attempting to bury a baby in the garden at the summer house?": [" \u201cA newly born infant,\u201d repeated Debray; \u201cthis affair becomes serious!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, \u201cI was not wrong just now then, when I said that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy because it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.\u201d \u201cWho said it was a crime?\u201d asked Villefort, with a last effort. \u201cHow? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?\u201d cried Monte Cristo. \u201cAnd pray what do you call such an action?\u201d \u201cBut who said it was buried alive?\u201d \u201cWhy bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a cemetery.\u201d \u201cWhat is done to infanticides in this country?\u201d asked Major Cavalcanti innocently. \u201cOh, their heads are soon cut off,\u201d said Danglars. \u201cAh, indeed?\u201d said Cavalcanti. \u201cI think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?\u201d asked Monte Cristo. \u201cYes, count,\u201d replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely human. Monte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far, said: \u201cCome, gentlemen,\u2014some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,\u201d and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn. \u201cIndeed, count,\u201d said Madame Danglars, \u201cI am ashamed to own it, but all your frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg you to let me sit down;\u201d and she fell into a chair. Monte Cristo bowed, and went to Madame de Villefort.", " This was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen\u2019s coachmen on a cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door.

Her face, therefore, like that of the gentleman, was perfectly unknown to the two concierges, who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion.", " Chapter 50. The Morrel Family In a very few minutes the count reached No. 7 in the Rue Meslay. The house was of white stone, and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers. In the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized Cocles; but as he had but one eye, and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years, Cocles did not recognize the count. The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn, to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork,\u2014an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter, and had gained for the place the appellation of _The Little Versailles_. It is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin. The house, with kitchens and cellars below, had above the ground floor, two stories and attics. The whole of the property, consisting of an immense workshop, two pavilions at the bottom of the garden, and the garden itself, had been purchased by Emmanuel, who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation. He had reserved the house and half the garden, and building a wall between the garden and the workshops, had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden. So that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged, and as perfectly shut out from observation, as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the Faubourg St. Germain.", " The house belonged, as the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de Saint-M\u00e9ran, Villefort\u2019s father-in-law. M. de Saint-M\u00e9ran lived at Marseilles, so that this country house was useless to him, and it was reported to be let to a young widow, known only by the name of \u2018the Baroness.\u2019 \u201cOne evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not overlooked by any windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de Villefort. When she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features, I saw she was from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair. As she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure, I saw she would ere long become a mother. A few moments after, the little door was opened and a man entered. The young woman hastened to meet him. They threw themselves into each other\u2019s arms, embraced tenderly, and returned together to the house. The man was M. de Villefort; I fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone.\u201d 20291m \u201cAnd,\u201d asked the count, \u201cdid you ever know the name of this woman?\u201d \u201cNo, excellency,\u201d returned Bertuccio; \u201cyou will see that I had no time to learn it.\u201d \u201cGo on.\u201d \u201cThat evening,\u201d continued Bertuccio, \u201cI could have killed the procureur, but as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood, I was fearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if his cries were overheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the next occasion, and in order that nothing should escape me, I took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden."], "Which alias did Dant\u00e8s use when he visited Bertuccio in prison?": [" \u201cYou talk like a noodle, my friend,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cand here is Danglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to you that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars. \u201cI won\u2019t hold my tongue!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201cI say I want to know why they should put Dant\u00e8s in prison; I like Dant\u00e8s; Dant\u00e8s, your health!\u201d and he swallowed another glass of wine. 0057m Danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \u201cWell, you understand there is no need to kill him.\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having Dant\u00e8s arrested.", " Well, I shall write to the abb\u00e9; I shall hold him responsible for his _prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s_ misconduct, and I shall soon know all about this assassination. Only I warn you, that when I reside in a country, I conform to all its code, and I have no wish to put myself within the compass of the French laws for your sake.\u201d \u201cOh, do not do that, excellency; I have always served you faithfully,\u201d cried Bertuccio, in despair. \u201cI have always been an honest man, and, as far as lay in my power, I have done good.\u201d \u201cI do not deny it,\u201d returned the count; \u201cbut why are you thus agitated. It is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks, and such fever in the hands of a man.\u201d \u201cBut, your excellency,\u201d replied Bertuccio hesitatingly, \u201cdid not the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, who heard my confession in the prison at N\u00eemes, tell you that I had a heavy burden upon my conscience?\u201d \u201cYes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward, I concluded you had stolen\u2014that was all.\u201d \u201cOh, your excellency!\u201d returned Bertuccio in deep contempt. \u201cOr, as you are a Corsican, that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a \u2018stiff,\u2019 as you call it.\u201d \u201cYes, my good master,\u201d cried Bertuccio, casting himself at the count\u2019s feet, \u201cit was simply vengeance\u2014nothing else.\u201d \u201cI understand that, but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner.\u201d \u201cBut, monsieur, it is very natural,\u201d returned Bertuccio, \u201csince it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished.\u201d \u201cWhat!", " The notary left the room backwards, and bowing down to the ground; it was the first time he had ever met a similar client. \u201cSee this gentleman out,\u201d said the count to Bertuccio. And the steward followed the notary out of the room. Scarcely was the count alone, when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock, and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck, and which never left him. After having sought for a few minutes, he stopped at a leaf which had several notes, and compared them with the deed of sale, which lay on the table, and recalling his _souvenirs_\u2014 \u201c\u2018Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28;\u2019 it is indeed the same,\u201d said he; \u201cand now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror? However, in an hour I shall know all. Bertuccio!\u201d cried he, striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong. \u201cBertuccio!\u201d The steward appeared at the door. \u201cMonsieur Bertuccio,\u201d said the count, \u201cdid you never tell me that you had travelled in France?\u201d \u201cIn some parts of France\u2014yes, excellency.\u201d \u201cYou know the environs of Paris, then?\u201d \u201cNo, excellency, no,\u201d returned the steward, with a sort of nervous trembling, which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur in all emotions, rightly attributed to great disquietude. \u201cIt is unfortunate,\u201d returned he, \u201cthat you have never visited the environs, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and had you gone with me, you could have given me some useful information.\u201d \u201cTo Auteuil!\u201d cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became livid\u2014\u201cI go to Auteuil?\u201d \u201cWell, what is there surprising in that?", " Just then the door opened, and the jailer, addressing himself to Bertuccio, said: \u201cExcuse me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner.\u201d \u201cAnd so closes our interview,\u201d said Andrea to the worthy steward; \u201cI wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!\u201d \u201cI will return tomorrow,\u201d said Bertuccio. \u201cGood! Gendarmes, I am at your service. Ah, sir, do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of!\u201d \u201cIt shall be done,\u201d replied Bertuccio. Andrea extended his hand; Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket, and merely jingled a few pieces of money. \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean,\u201d said Andrea, endeavoring to smile, quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of Bertuccio. \u201cCan I be deceived?\u201d he murmured, as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call \u201cthe salad basket.\u201d \u201cNever mind, we shall see! Tomorrow, then!\u201d he added, turning towards Bertuccio. \u201cTomorrow!\u201d replied the steward. Chapter 108. The Judge We remember that the Abb\u00e9 Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the chamber of death, and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girl\u2019s body. Perhaps it was the Christian exhortations of the abb\u00e9, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his persuasive words, which had restored the courage of Noirtier, for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for Valentine."], "What does Monte Cristo instruct Bertuccio to purchase at twice the asking price?": [" They went over a tolerably large ground floor; a first floor consisted of a salon, a bathroom, and two bedrooms; near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden. \u201cAh, here is a private staircase,\u201d said the count; \u201cthat is convenient. Light me, M. Bertuccio, and go first; we will see where it leads to.\u201d \u201cMonsieur,\u201d replied Bertuccio, \u201cit leads to the garden.\u201d \u201cAnd, pray, how do you know that?\u201d \u201cIt ought to do so, at least.\u201d \u201cWell, let us be sure of that.\u201d Bertuccio sighed, and went on first; the stairs did, indeed, lead to the garden. At the outer door the steward paused. \u201cGo on, Monsieur Bertuccio,\u201d said the count. But he who was addressed stood there, stupefied, bewildered, stunned; his haggard eyes glanced around, as if in search of the traces of some terrible event, and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections. \u201cWell!\u201d insisted the Count. \u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Bertuccio, setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall. \u201cNo, monsieur, it is impossible; I can go no farther.\u201d \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo. \u201cWhy, you must see, your excellency,\u201d cried the steward, \u201cthat this is not natural; that, having a house to purchase, you purchase it exactly at Auteuil, and that, purchasing it at Auteuil, this house should be No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine. Oh, why did I not tell you all?", " \u201cAnd the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house?\u201d \u201cYour excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best engraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The first card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e d\u2019Antin, No. 7; the others are on the mantle-piece of your excellency\u2019s bedroom.\u201d \u201cGood; what o\u2019clock is it?\u201d \u201cFour o\u2019clock.\u201d Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same French footman who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf\u2019s, and then he passed into the small salon, preceded by Bertuccio, who showed him the way. \u201cThese are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cI trust all this will soon be taken away.\u201d Bertuccio bowed. As the steward had said, the notary awaited him in the small salon. He was a simple-looking lawyer\u2019s clerk, elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener. \u201cYou are the notary empowered to sell the country house that I wish to purchase, monsieur?\u201d asked Monte Cristo. \u201cYes, count,\u201d returned the notary. \u201cIs the deed of sale ready?\u201d \u201cYes, count.\u201d \u201cHave you brought it?\u201d \u201cHere it is.\u201d \u201cVery well; and where is this house that I purchase?\u201d asked the count carelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the notary. The steward made a gesture that signified, \u201cI do not know.\u201d The notary looked at the count with astonishment.", " \u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201cdoes not the count know where the house he purchases is situated?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d returned the count. \u201cThe count does not know?\u201d \u201cHow should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have never before been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even set my foot in France.\u201d \u201cAh, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil.\u201d At these words Bertuccio turned pale. \u201cAnd where is Auteuil?\u201d asked the count. \u201cClose by here, monsieur,\u201d replied the notary\u2014\u201ca little beyond Passy; a charming situation, in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne.\u201d \u201cSo near as that?\u201d said the Count; \u201cbut that is not in the country. What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M. Bertuccio?\u201d \u201cI,\u201d cried the steward with a strange expression. \u201cHis excellency did not charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency will recollect\u2014if he will think\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cAh, true,\u201d observed Monte Cristo; \u201cI recollect now. I read the advertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false title, \u2018a country house.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt is not yet too late,\u201d cried Bertuccio, eagerly; \u201cand if your excellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a better at Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d returned Monte Cristo negligently; \u201csince I have this, I will keep it.\u201d \u201cAnd you are quite right,\u201d said the notary, who feared to lose his fee. \u201cIt is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water and fine trees; a comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long time, without reckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet valuable, now that old things are so much sought after.", " When I live at Auteuil, you must come there, as you belong to my service.\u201d Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master, and remained motionless, without making any answer. \u201cWhy, what has happened to you?\u2014are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage?\u201d asked Monte Cristo, in the same tone that Louis XIV. pronounced the famous, \u201cI have been almost obliged to wait.\u201d Bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber, and cried in a hoarse voice: \u201cHis excellency\u2019s horses!\u201d Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the steward appeared. \u201cYour excellency\u2019s carriage is at the door,\u201d said he. \u201cWell, take your hat and gloves,\u201d returned Monte Cristo. \u201cAm I to accompany you, your excellency?\u201d cried Bertuccio. \u201cCertainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the house.\u201d 20277m It was unexampled for a servant of the count\u2019s to dare to dispute an order of his, so the steward, without saying a word, followed his master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to follow, which he did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat. Chapter 43. The House at Auteuil Monte Cristo noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio signed himself in the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the carriage, muttered a short prayer. Anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward\u2019s extraordinary repugnance for the count\u2019s projected drive without the walls; but the count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this little journey."], "Who saves Madame de Villefort and her son by lassoing their horses as they run wild past Monte Cristo\u2019s house?": [" \u201cAre you going to leave us, count?\u201d said Madame de Villefort. \u201cI am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you of your promise for Saturday.\u201d \u201cDid you fear that we should forget it?\u201d \u201cYou are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many important and urgent occupations.\u201d \u201cMy husband has given me his word, sir,\u201d said Madame de Villefort; \u201cyou have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose, and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d said Villefort, \u201cis it at your house in the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that you receive your visitors?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cwhich is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious,\u2014it is in the country.\u201d \u201cIn the country?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere is it, then? Near Paris, is it not?\u201d \u201cVery near, only half a league from the Barriers,\u2014it is at Auteuil.\u201d \u201cAt Auteuil?\u201d said Villefort; \u201ctrue, Madame de Villefort told me you lived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken. And in what part of Auteuil do you reside?\u201d \u201cRue de la Fontaine.\u201d \u201cRue de la Fontaine!\u201d exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone; \u201cat what number?\u201d \u201cNo. 28.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d cried Villefort, \u201cwas it you who bought M. de Saint-M\u00e9ran\u2019s house!\u201d \u201cDid it belong to M. de Saint-M\u00e9ran?\u201d demanded Monte Cristo. \u201cYes,\u201d replied Madame de Villefort; \u201cand, would you believe it, count\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cBelieve what?\u201d \u201cYou think this house pretty, do you not?\u201d \u201cI think it charming.\u201d \u201cWell, my husband would never live in it.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d returned Monte Cristo, \u201cthat is a prejudice on your part, M. de Villefort, for which I am quite at a loss to account.\u201d \u201cI do not like Auteuil, sir,\u201d said the procureur, making an evident effort to appear calm.", " \u201cI think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle,\u201d he said. But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend, the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars, \u201cI must speak to you.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cTomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cIn my office, or in the court, if you like,\u2014that is the surest place.\u201d \u201cI will be there.\u201d At this moment Madame de Villefort approached. \u201cThanks, my dear friend,\u201d said Madame Danglars, trying to smile; \u201cit is over now, and I am much better.\u201d Chapter 64. The Beggar The evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced. On his wife\u2019s request, M. de Villefort was the first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife. As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars. Without opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, and Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort\u2019s carriage.", " Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races, count?\u201d \u201cI shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement.\u201d \u201cAre you fond of horses, count?\u201d \u201cI have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things\u2014the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.\u201d \u201cNay, count,\u201d said the baroness, \u201cit would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first.\u201d \u201cYou see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.\u201d At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir; approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone. Madame Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed: \u201cI cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.\u201d \u201cI assure you, madame,\u201d replied the woman, \u201cit is as I have said.\u201d Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, \u201cIs this true?\u201d \u201cIs what true, madame?\u201d inquired Danglars, visibly agitated. \u201cWhat my maid tells me.\u201d \u201cBut what does she tell you?\u201d \u201cThat when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage, he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge. I desire to know what is the meaning of this?\u201d \u201cBe kind enough, madame, to listen to me,\u201d said Danglars.", " Baptistin looked at his master, who made a sign to him, and he went out, closing the door after him. \u201cWho are you, madame?\u201d said the count to the veiled woman. 40227m The stranger cast one look around her, to be certain that they were quite alone; then bending as if she would have knelt, and joining her hands, she said with an accent of despair: \u201cEdmond, you will not kill my son!\u201d The count retreated a step, uttered a slight exclamation, and let fall the pistol he held. \u201cWhat name did you pronounce then, Madame de Morcerf?\u201d said he. \u201cYours!\u201d cried she, throwing back her veil,\u2014\u201cyours, which I alone, perhaps, have not forgotten. Edmond, it is not Madame de Morcerf who is come to you, it is Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.\u201d \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s is dead, madame,\u201d said Monte Cristo; \u201cI know no one now of that name.\u201d \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s lives, sir, and she remembers, for she alone recognized you when she saw you, and even before she saw you, by your voice, Edmond,\u2014by the simple sound of your voice; and from that moment she has followed your steps, watched you, feared you, and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes M. de Morcerf.\u201d \u201cFernand, do you mean?\u201d replied Monte Cristo, with bitter irony; \u201csince we are recalling names, let us remember them all.\u201d Monte Cristo had pronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s felt a thrill of horror run through every vein. \u201cYou see, Edmond, I am not mistaken, and have cause to say, \u2018Spare my son!\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd who told you, madame, that I have any hostile intentions against your son?\u201d \u201cNo one, in truth; but a mother has twofold sight."], "When Villefort visits Monte Cristo, he reveals that Noirtier has been ___.": [" It would be noble to see Mademoiselle Noirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay.\u201d Villefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming. \u201cAlthough,\u201d said Villefort, \u201cit will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose her grandfather\u2019s fortune, I do not think that M. d\u2019\u00c9pinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in greater esteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that Valentine is rich in right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit the fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-M\u00e9ran, her mother\u2019s parents, who both love her tenderly.\u201d \u201cAnd who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,\u201d said Madame de Villefort; \u201cbesides, they are to come to Paris in about a month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with M. Noirtier.\u201d The count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self-love and defeated ambition. \u201cBut it seems to me,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cand I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am about to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward.\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe; \u201cis it not unjust\u2014shamefully unjust?", " \u201cYes, since she lives.\u201d At that moment d\u2019Avrigny\u2019s glance met Noirtier\u2019s eye. It glistened with such extraordinary joy, so rich and full of thought, that the physician was struck. He placed the young girl again on the chair,\u2014her lips were scarcely discernible, they were so pale and white, as well as her whole face,\u2014and remained motionless, looking at Noirtier, who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did. \u201cSir,\u201d said d\u2019Avrigny to Villefort, \u201ccall Mademoiselle Valentine\u2019s maid, if you please.\u201d Villefort went himself to find her; and d\u2019Avrigny approached Noirtier. \u201cHave you something to tell me?\u201d asked he. The old man winked his eyes expressively, which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval. \u201cPrivately?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, I will remain with you.\u201d At this moment Villefort returned, followed by the lady\u2019s maid; and after her came Madame de Villefort. \u201cWhat is the matter, then, with this dear child? she has just left me, and she complained of being indisposed, but I did not think seriously of it.\u201d The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother, approached Valentine and took her hand. D\u2019Avrigny continued to look at Noirtier; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round, his cheeks turn pale and tremble; the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead. \u201cAh,\u201d said he, involuntarily following Noirtier\u2019s eyes, which were fixed on Madame de Villefort, who repeated: \u201cThis poor child would be better in bed.", " It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry, but because she will marry, a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow. Old age is selfish, sir, and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M. Noirtier, which she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness d\u2019\u00c9pinay. My father\u2019s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects, which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding, and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time, although, he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married, M. Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson.\u201d M. de Villefort had scarcely said this, when the door opened, and Barrois appeared. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances,\u2014\u201cgentlemen, M. Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d\u2019\u00c9pinay.\u201d He, as well as the notary, that there might be no mistake in the person, gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect. Villefort started, Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees, Valentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue. Albert and Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud exchanged a second look, more full of amazement than the first. The notary looked at Villefort. \u201cIt is impossible,\u201d said the procureur. \u201cM. d\u2019\u00c9pinay cannot leave the drawing-room at present.\u201d \u201cIt is at this moment,\u201d replied Barrois with the same firmness, \u201cthat M. Noirtier, my master, wishes to speak on important subjects to M. Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay.\u201d \u201cGrandpapa Noirtier can speak now, then,\u201d said Edward, with his habitual quickness.", " M. d\u2019Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes, and watched her hurried retreat. He lifted up the drapery over the entrance to Edward\u2019s room, and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villefort\u2019s apartment, he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor. \u201cGo to the assistance of Madame de Villefort,\u201d he said to the nurse. \u201cMadame de Villefort is ill.\u201d 50087m \u201cBut Mademoiselle de Villefort\u2014\u2014\u201d stammered the nurse. \u201cMademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help,\u201d said d\u2019Avrigny, \u201csince she is dead.\u201d \u201cDead,\u2014dead!\u201d groaned forth Villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man. \u201cDead!\u201d repeated a third voice. \u201cWho said Valentine was dead?\u201d The two men turned round, and saw Morrel standing at the door, pale and terror-stricken. This is what had happened. At the usual time, Morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtier\u2019s room. Contrary to custom, the door was open, and having no occasion to ring he entered. He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to M. Noirtier; but no one answered, the servants having, as we know, deserted the house. Morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live, and so far he had always fulfilled his word. Every night the count had given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by Noirtier."], "According to Maximillian Morrel, who does his father believe is truly responsible for saving the family from financial ruin?": [" Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all right, Edmond.

Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?\u201d \u201cThat is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute\u2014a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.\u201d \u201cBut tell me, Dant\u00e8s, if you had command of the _Pharaon_ should you be glad to see Danglars remain?\u201d \u201cCaptain or mate, M.

Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!\u201d \u201cI hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond.", " At first, perhaps, he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the Lord, but at last he took patience and waited. One day he miraculously left the prison, transformed, rich, powerful. His first cry was for his father; but that father was dead.\u201d \u201cMy father, too, is dead,\u201d said Morrel. \u201cYes; but your father died in your arms, happy, respected, rich, and full of years; his father died poor, despairing, almost doubtful of Providence; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards, his tomb had disappeared, and no one could say, \u2018There sleeps the father you so well loved.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d exclaimed Morrel. \u201cHe was, then, a more unhappy son than you, Morrel, for he could not even find his father\u2019s grave.\u201d \u201cBut then he had the woman he loved still remaining?\u201d \u201cYou are deceived, Morrel, that woman\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cShe was dead?\u201d \u201cWorse than that, she was faithless, and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed. You see, then, Morrel, that he was a more unhappy lover than you.\u201d \u201cAnd has he found consolation?\u201d \u201cHe has at least found peace.\u201d \u201cAnd does he ever expect to be happy?\u201d \u201cHe hopes so, Maximilian.\u201d The young man\u2019s head fell on his breast. \u201cYou have my promise,\u201d he said, after a minute\u2019s pause, extending his hand to Monte Cristo. \u201cOnly remember\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cOn the 5th of October, Morrel, I shall expect you at the Island of Monte Cristo. On the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of Bastia, it will be called the _Eurus_.", " He was thunderstruck. Then, rushing hastily out of the apartment, he ran upstairs, expecting to find his father in his study, but he rapped there in vain. While he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open, turned, and saw his father. Instead of going direct to his study, M. Morrel had returned to his bedchamber, which he was only this moment quitting. Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son, of whose arrival he was ignorant. He remained motionless on the spot, pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat. Maximilian sprang down the staircase, and threw his arms round his father\u2019s neck; but suddenly he recoiled, and placed his right hand on Morrel\u2019s breast. \u201cFather,\u201d he exclaimed, turning pale as death, \u201cwhat are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat?\u201d \u201cOh, this is what I feared!\u201d said Morrel. \u201cFather, father, in Heaven\u2019s name,\u201d exclaimed the young man, \u201cwhat are these weapons for?\u201d \u201cMaximilian,\u201d replied Morrel, looking fixedly at his son, \u201cyou are a man, and a man of honor. Come, and I will explain to you.\u201d And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian followed him, trembling as he went. Morrel opened the door, and closed it behind his son; then, crossing the anteroom, went to his desk on which he placed the pistols, and pointed with his finger to an open ledger. In this ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his affairs.", " Morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair. The two men remained opposite one another, Morrel trembling in every limb, the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity. The noise had ceased; but it seemed that Morrel expected something\u2014something had occasioned the noise, and something must follow. The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and that the footsteps, which were those of several persons, stopped at the door. A key was inserted in the lock of the first door, and the creaking of hinges was audible. \u201cThere are only two persons who have the key to that door,\u201d murmured Morrel, \u201cCocles and Julie.\u201d At this instant the second door opened, and the young girl, her eyes bathed with tears, appeared. Morrel rose tremblingly, supporting himself by the arm of the chair. He would have spoken, but his voice failed him. \u201cOh, father!\u201d said she, clasping her hands, \u201cforgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings.\u201d Morrel again changed color. Julie threw herself into his arms. \u201cOh, father, father!\u201d murmured she, \u201ccourage!\u201d \u201cThe _Pharaon_ has gone down, then?\u201d said Morrel in a hoarse voice. The young girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father\u2019s breast. \u201cAnd the crew?\u201d asked Morrel. \u201cSaved,\u201d said the girl; \u201csaved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor.\u201d Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude."], "When Monte Cristo visits the Villeforts\u2019 home, Madame de Villefort is particularly interested in his knowledge of ___.": [" \u201cI think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle,\u201d he said. But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend, the procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars, \u201cI must speak to you.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cTomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cIn my office, or in the court, if you like,\u2014that is the surest place.\u201d \u201cI will be there.\u201d At this moment Madame de Villefort approached. \u201cThanks, my dear friend,\u201d said Madame Danglars, trying to smile; \u201cit is over now, and I am much better.\u201d Chapter 64. The Beggar The evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced. On his wife\u2019s request, M. de Villefort was the first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife. As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars. Without opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, and Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort\u2019s carriage.", " \u201cAre you going to leave us, count?\u201d said Madame de Villefort. \u201cI am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you of your promise for Saturday.\u201d \u201cDid you fear that we should forget it?\u201d \u201cYou are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many important and urgent occupations.\u201d \u201cMy husband has given me his word, sir,\u201d said Madame de Villefort; \u201cyou have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose, and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d said Villefort, \u201cis it at your house in the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es that you receive your visitors?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cwhich is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious,\u2014it is in the country.\u201d \u201cIn the country?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere is it, then?

And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess Lucina? And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not to disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father carrying the sleeping child?\u201d Here Madame Danglars, instead of being calmed by the soft picture, uttered a groan and fainted. \u201cMadame Danglars is ill,\u201d said Villefort; \u201cit would be better to take her to her carriage.\u201d \u201cOh, _mon Dieu!_\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cand I have forgotten my smelling-bottle!\u201d \u201cI have mine,\u201d said Madame de Villefort; and she passed over to Monte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on Edward. \u201cAh,\u201d said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cat your advice I have made the trial.\u201d \u201cAnd have you succeeded?\u201d \u201cI think so.\u201d Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she returned to consciousness. \u201cAh,\u201d she cried, \u201cwhat a frightful dream!\u201d Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. They looked for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major Cavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence. Monte Cristo seemed in despair. He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and conducted her into the garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalcanti.", " You see this is a fit of apoplexy, and he might be saved if he could but be bled!\u201d \u201cHas he eaten anything lately?\u201d asked Madame de Villefort, eluding her husband\u2019s question. \u201cMadame,\u201d replied Valentine, \u201che has not even breakfasted. He has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him, and when he returned, took nothing but a glass of lemonade.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Madame de Villefort, \u201cwhy did he not take wine? Lemonade was a very bad thing for him.\u201d \u201cGrandpapa\u2019s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side; poor Barrois was very thirsty, and was thankful to drink anything he could find.\u201d Madame de Villefort started.

Every transport of a daughter finding a father, all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover, were felt by Hayd\u00e9e during the first moments of this meeting, which she had so eagerly expected. Doubtless, although less evident, Monte Cristo\u2019s joy was not less intense. Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is outwardly apparent. Monte Cristo was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time dared to believe, that there were two Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s in the world, and he might yet be happy. His eye, elate with happiness, was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of Hayd\u00e9e, when suddenly the door opened.

Albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner.

Until then you will not see me. \u2014Constancy and Discretion.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d asked he, when Franz had finished, \u201cwhat do you think of that?\u201d \u201cI think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.\u201d \u201cI think so, also,\u201d replied Albert; \u201cand I very much fear you will go alone to the Duke of Bracciano\u2019s ball.\u201d Franz and Albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman banker. \u201cTake care, Albert,\u201d said Franz. \u201cAll the nobility of Rome will be present, and if your fair _incognita_ belong to the higher class of society, she must go there.\u201d \u201cWhether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,\u201d returned Albert.", " She has always been opposed to this marriage, and I should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them.\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d said Villefort, \u201cbelieve me, a fortune of 900,000 francs is not so easily renounced.\u201d \u201cShe could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir, since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent.\u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d replied Villefort; \u201cI say that this marriage _shall_ be consummated.\u201d \u201cNotwithstanding your father\u2019s wishes to the contrary?\u201d said Madame de Villefort, selecting a new point of attack. \u201cThat is a serious thing.\u201d Monte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every word that was said. 30185m \u201cMadame,\u201d replied Villefort \u201cI can truly say that I have always entertained a high respect for my father, because, to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority. The name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey. But, under the present circumstances, I am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his anger on the son. It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices. I shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward M. Noirtier; I will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me; but I shall remain firm in my determination, and the world shall see which party has reason on his side."], "Whose devoted servant is Barrois?": [" \u201cHe will come in here, and M. Morrel had better go,\u2014do you not think so, grandpapa?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d signed the old man. \u201cBarrois,\u201d cried Valentine, \u201cBarrois!\u201d \u201cI am coming, mademoiselle,\u201d replied he. \u201cBarrois will open the door for you,\u201d said Valentine, addressing Morrel. \u201cAnd now remember one thing, Monsieur Officer, that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill-advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness.\u201d 40108m \u201cI promised him to wait,\u201d replied Morrel; \u201cand I will wait.\u201d At this moment Barrois entered. \u201cWho rang?\u201d asked Valentine. \u201cDoctor d\u2019Avrigny,\u201d said Barrois, staggering as if he would fall. \u201cWhat is the matter, Barrois?\u201d said Valentine. The old man did not answer, but looked at his master with wild staring eyes, while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright. \u201cHe is going to fall!\u201d cried Morrel. The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased, the features of the face became quite altered, and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder. Noirtier, seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man. Barrois made some steps towards his master. \u201cAh, sir,\u201d said he, \u201ctell me what is the matter with me. I am suffering\u2014I cannot see.

Noirtier\u2019s eye was fixed on the dictionary. \u201cYes, I understand, grandfather,\u201d said the young girl. 40036m She pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man stopped her. She opened, and found the word \u201csecret.\u201d \u201cAh! is there a secret spring?\u201d said Valentine. \u201cYes,\u201d said Noirtier. \u201cAnd who knows it?\u201d Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out. \u201cBarrois?\u201d said she. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cShall I call him?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Valentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefort\u2019s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and Franz was stupefied.

Barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string. \u201cIs that what you wish for?\u201d said Barrois. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cShall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cTo Mademoiselle Valentine?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cTo M.

The doctor left him in this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it, and, going up to Noirtier, said abruptly: \u201cHow do you find yourself?\u2014well?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHave you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light and comfortable\u2014eh?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDid Barrois make your lemonade?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWas it you who asked him to drink some of it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWas it M. de Villefort?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cMadame?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cIt was your granddaughter, then, was it not?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d A groan from Barrois, accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones, attracted the attention of M. d\u2019Avrigny; he left M.

The Lemonade Morrel was, in fact, very happy. M. Noirtier had just sent for him, and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab, placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab-horse. He had therefore set off at a furious rate from the Rue Meslay, and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9. Morrel advanced with a firm, manly tread, and poor Barrois followed him as he best might. Morrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years of age; Morrel was deeply in love, and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion. These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of a triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet nevertheless possessing their point of union. This point of union was Noirtier, and it was he who had just sent for Morrel, with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him\u2014a command which Morrel obeyed to the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois. On arriving at the house, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends wings to our desires; but Barrois, who had long forgotten what it was to love, was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use. The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance, closed the door of the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of Valentine."], "Monte Cristo bribes a telegraph operator to send a false report of an impending revolution in ___.": [" \u201cBut I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company, sir,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cNo, count,\u2014I hope\u2014I assure you I shall do my best,\u201d stammered Villefort. \u201cOh,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cI allow of no excuse.

He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream. \u201cSir,\u201d said Monte Cristo to him, \u201cI do not recommend my pictures to you, who possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are two by Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael, a Van Dyck, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at.\u201d \u201cStay,\u201d said Debray; \u201cI recognize this Hobbema.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed!\u201d \u201cYes; it was proposed for the Museum.\u201d \u201cWhich, I believe, does not contain one?\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cNo; and yet they refused to buy it.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud. \u201cYou pretend not to know,\u2014because government was not rich enough.\u201d \u201cAh, pardon me,\u201d said Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud; \u201cI have heard of these things every day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them yet.\u201d \u201cYou will, by and by,\u201d said Debray. \u201cI think not,\u201d replied Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud. \u201cMajor Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,\u201d announced Baptistin. A black satin stock, fresh from the maker\u2019s hands, gray moustaches, a bold eye, a major\u2019s uniform, ornamented with three medals and five crosses\u2014in fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldier\u2014such was the appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father with whom we are already acquainted. Close to him, dressed in entirely new clothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful son, whom we also know.", " Andrea assumed his gayest manner. \u201cYou know, my dear count,\u201d said he, \u201cthe ceremony is to take place this evening. At nine o\u2019clock the contract is to be signed at my father-in-law\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed?\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cWhat; is it news to you? Has not M. Danglars informed you of the ceremony?\u201d \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said the count; \u201cI received a letter from him yesterday, but I do not think the hour was mentioned.\u201d \u201cPossibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cyou are fortunate, M. Cavalcanti; it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting, and Mademoiselle Danglars is a handsome girl.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed she is,\u201d replied Cavalcanti, in a very modest tone. \u201cAbove all, she is very rich,\u2014at least, I believe so,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cVery rich, do you think?\u201d replied the young man. \u201cDoubtless; it is said M. Danglars conceals at least half of his fortune.\u201d \u201cAnd he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions,\u201d said Andrea with a look sparkling with joy. \u201cWithout reckoning,\u201d added Monte Cristo, \u201cthat he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United States and in England, but quite novel in France.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I know what you mean,\u2014the railway, of which he has obtained the grant, is it not?\u201d \u201cPrecisely; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair.\u201d \u201cTen millions! Do you think so? It is magnificent!\u201d said Cavalcanti, who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words.", " But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti. It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young man was received at the banker\u2019s as the betrothed. Letters had been despatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count\u2019s father, who highly approved of the union, regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time, and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres. It was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to invest; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father-in-law, who had of late sustained repeated losses; but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron. The baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti; not so Mademoiselle Eug\u00e9nie Danglars. With an instinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered Andrea\u2019s attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf; but when Andrea urged his suit, she betrayed an entire dislike to him. The baron might possibly have perceived it, but, attributing it to a caprice, feigned ignorance. The delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired. Morcerf appreciated the advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord."], "At Auteil, what does Monte Cristo tell his dinner guests that he discovered buried in his garden?": [" \u201cA newly born infant,\u201d repeated Debray; \u201cthis affair becomes serious!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, \u201cI was not wrong just now then, when I said that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy because it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.\u201d \u201cWho said it was a crime?\u201d asked Villefort, with a last effort. \u201cHow? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?\u201d cried Monte Cristo. \u201cAnd pray what do you call such an action?\u201d \u201cBut who said it was buried alive?\u201d \u201cWhy bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a cemetery.\u201d \u201cWhat is done to infanticides in this country?\u201d asked Major Cavalcanti innocently. \u201cOh, their heads are soon cut off,\u201d said Danglars. \u201cAh, indeed?\u201d said Cavalcanti. \u201cI think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?\u201d asked Monte Cristo. \u201cYes, count,\u201d replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely human. Monte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far, said: \u201cCome, gentlemen,\u2014some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,\u201d and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn. \u201cIndeed, count,\u201d said Madame Danglars, \u201cI am ashamed to own it, but all your frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg you to let me sit down;\u201d and she fell into a chair. Monte Cristo bowed, and went to Madame de Villefort.", " And there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges10 or Desdemona. Stay, since we have finished dinner, I will show it to you, and then we will take coffee in the garden. After dinner, the play.\u201d Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests. Madame de Villefort rose, Monte Cristo did the same, and the rest followed their example. Villefort and Madame Danglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to their seats; they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d said Madame Danglars. \u201cWe must go,\u201d replied Villefort, offering his arm. The others, attracted by curiosity, were already scattered in different parts of the house; for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room, and that, at the same time, they would obtain a view of the rest of the building, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace. Each one went out by the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained; then, when they had passed, he brought up the rear, and on his face was a smile, which, if they could have understood it, would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter. They began by walking through the apartments, many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style, with cushions and divans instead of beds, and pipes instead of furniture. The drawing-rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters, the boudoirs hung with draperies from China, of fanciful colors, fantastic design, and wonderful texture.", " I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking anything with you. Do not seek to know how I discovered it; I know it\u2014that is sufficient. \u201cNow, listen, Albert. Twenty-four years ago I returned, proud and joyful, to my country. I had a betrothed, Albert, a lovely girl whom I adored, and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis, painfully amassed by ceaseless toil. This money was for her; I destined it for her, and, knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles, on the All\u00e9es de Meilhan. Your mother, Albert, knows that poor house well. A short time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old place, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure. The iron box was there\u2014no one had touched it\u2014under a beautiful fig-tree my father had planted the day I was born, which overshadowed the spot. Well, Albert, this money, which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored, may now, through strange and painful circumstances, be devoted to the same purpose. \u201cOh, feel for me, who could offer millions to that poor woman, but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved.", " my house?\u201d \u201cOh, your excellency, it was not yours, then.\u201d \u201cWhose, then? The Marquis de Saint-M\u00e9ran, I think, the concierge said. What had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-M\u00e9ran?\u201d \u201cOh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.\u201d \u201cThis is strange,\u201d returned Monte Cristo, seeming to yield to his reflections, \u201cthat you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse.\u201d \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the steward, \u201cit is fatality, I am sure. First, you purchase a house at Auteuil\u2014this house is the one where I have committed an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received the blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child. This is not chance, for chance, in this case, is too much like Providence.\u201d \u201cWell, amiable Corsican, let us suppose it is Providence. I always suppose anything people please, and, besides, you must concede something to diseased minds. Come, collect yourself, and tell me all.\u201d \u201cI have related it but once, and that was to the Abb\u00e9 Busoni. Such things,\u201d continued Bertuccio, shaking his head, \u201care only related under the seal of confession.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the count, \u201cI refer you to your confessor. Turn Chartreux or Trappist, and relate your secrets, but, as for me, I do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms, and I do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening."], "After escaping from prison, who does Caderousse confront and demand a payment of 200 francs per month?": [" I had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of Morrel & Son; these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter, who was to be married in a fortnight, and these two hundred thousand francs were payable, half on the 15th of this month, and the other half on the 15th of next month. I had informed M. Morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually, and he has been here within the last half-hour to tell me that if his ship, the _Pharaon_, did not come into port on the 15th, he would be wholly unable to make this payment.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said the Englishman, \u201cthis looks very much like a suspension of payment.\u201d \u201cIt looks more like bankruptcy!\u201d exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly. The Englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said, \u201cFrom which it would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension?\u201d \u201cTo tell you the truth, I consider it lost.\u201d \u201cWell, then, I will buy it of you!\u201d \u201cYou?\u201d \u201cYes, I!\u201d \u201cBut at a tremendous discount, of course?\u201d \u201cNo, for two hundred thousand francs.

A ray of joy passed across M. de Boville\u2019s countenance, yet he made an effort at self-control, and said: \u201cSir, I ought to tell you that, in all probability, you will not realize six per cent of this sum.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s no affair of mine,\u201d replied the Englishman, \u201cthat is the affair of the house of Thomson & French, in whose name I act.", " You will take your place in the _coup\u00e9_ to Ch\u00e2lons.

Cavalcanti;\u201d after which he smiled, and turned towards the young man in question. Albert had left the count to speak to his mother, Danglars to converse with young Cavalcanti; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone. Meanwhile the heat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices."], "Madame Danglars\u2019 first husband killed himself after she bore whose illegitimate child?": [" You were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? Ah\u2014\u2014\u201d Madame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp. \u201cI know not; I merely suppose so, as I might suppose anything else,\u201d replied Villefort with a look so fixed, it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness. \u201cAh, my child, my poor child!\u201d cried the baroness, falling on her chair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief. Villefort, becoming somewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head, he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror he felt. \u201cYou understand, then, that if it were so,\u201d said he, rising in his turn, and approaching the baroness, to speak to her in a lower tone, \u201cwe are lost. This child lives, and someone knows it lives\u2014someone is in possession of our secret; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred, when that child could not be found, it is he who is in possession of our secret.\u201d \u201cJust God, avenging God!\u201d murmured Madame Danglars. Villefort\u2019s only answer was a stifled groan. \u201cBut the child\u2014the child, sir?\u201d repeated the agitated mother. \u201cHow I have searched for him,\u201d replied Villefort, wringing his hands; \u201chow I have called him in my long sleepless nights; how I have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men, and to find mine among them!", " \u201cI think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle,\u201d he said.

The Beggar The evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return to Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced. On his wife\u2019s request, M. de Villefort was the first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his landau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife. As for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M. Cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While Monte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he had noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars. Without opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, and Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort\u2019s carriage.", " Do you propose entering any horses at either of these races, count?\u201d \u201cI shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement.\u201d \u201cAre you fond of horses, count?\u201d \u201cI have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things\u2014the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.\u201d \u201cNay, count,\u201d said the baroness, \u201cit would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first.\u201d \u201cYou see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.\u201d At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir; approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone. Madame Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed: \u201cI cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.\u201d \u201cI assure you, madame,\u201d replied the woman, \u201cit is as I have said.\u201d Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, \u201cIs this true?\u201d \u201cIs what true, madame?\u201d inquired Danglars, visibly agitated. \u201cWhat my maid tells me.\u201d \u201cBut what does she tell you?\u201d \u201cThat when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage, he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge.

I declare, I expect to look magnificent in it, and chose that regiment only from vanity.\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s sighed while endeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son. \u201cWell, now you understand, mother!\u201d continued Albert; \u201chere are more than 4,000 francs settled on you; upon these you can live at least two years.\u201d \u201cDo you think so?\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s."], "After attending Monte Cristo\u2019s party, who does Danglars decide he would like his daughter to marry?": [" \u201cTruly, my daughter,\u201d replied he with a smile, \u201cyou are all you boast of being, excepting one thing; I will not too hastily tell you which, but would rather leave you to guess it.\u201d Eug\u00e9nie looked at Danglars, much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride, with which she had so superbly decked herself, should be disputed. \u201cMy daughter,\u201d continued the banker, \u201cyou have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you, who is determined she will not marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me, who has decided that his daughter shall marry.\u201d Eug\u00e9nie bowed, not as a submissive daughter, but as an adversary prepared for a discussion. \u201cMy daughter,\u201d continued Danglars, \u201cwhen a father asks his daughter to choose a husband, he has always some reason for wishing her to marry. Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now, that of living again in their grandchildren. This is not my weakness, I tell you at once; family joys have no charm for me. I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime.\u201d \u201cThis is not to the purpose,\u201d said Eug\u00e9nie; \u201clet us speak candidly, sir; I admire candor.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Danglars, \u201cI can, when circumstances render it desirable, adopt your system, although it may not be my general practice.

M.

A mantle-piece, with two modern S\u00e8vres vases, a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with an engraving on each side\u2014one representing Homer carrying his guide, the other, Belisarius begging\u2014a grayish paper; red and black tapestry\u2014such was the appearance of Lord Wilmore\u2019s drawing-room. It was illuminated by lamps with ground-glass shades which gave only a feeble light, as if out of consideration for the envoy\u2019s weak sight. After ten minutes\u2019 expectation the clock struck ten; at the fifth stroke the door opened and Lord Wilmore appeared. He was rather above the middle height, with thin reddish whiskers, light complexion and light hair, turning rather gray. He was dressed with all the English peculiarity, namely, in a blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar, in the fashion of 1811, a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen pantaloons, three inches too short, but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee. His first remark on entering was: \u201cYou know, sir, I do not speak French?\u201d \u201cI know you do not like to converse in our language,\u201d replied the envoy. \u201cBut you may use it,\u201d replied Lord Wilmore; \u201cI understand it.\u201d \u201cAnd I,\u201d replied the visitor, changing his idiom, \u201cknow enough of English to keep up the conversation. Do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience.\u201d \u201cAw?\u201d said Lord Wilmore, with that tone which is only known to natives of Great Britain.", " The envoy presented his letter of introduction, which the latter read with English coolness, and having finished: \u201cI understand,\u201d said he, \u201cperfectly.\u201d 30293m Then began the questions, which were similar to those which had been addressed to the Abb\u00e9 Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of the count\u2019s enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more numerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten years of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of India who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met him and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken prisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had escaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices; then the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the Grecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was consolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district, which was given him. Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord Wilmore\u2019s opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum,\u2014a precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine. \u201cBut,\u201d asked the visitor, \u201cdo you know why he came to France?\u201d \u201cHe is speculating in railways,\u201d said Lord Wilmore, \u201cand as he is an expert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of telegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection.\u201d \u201cHow much does he spend yearly?\u201d asked the prefect.", " Do you know about that institution?\u201d \u201cI have heard of it.\u201d \u201cIt is a magnificent charity.\u201d Having said this, the abb\u00e9 bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies. The visitor either understood the abb\u00e9\u2019s meaning, or had no more questions to ask; he arose, and the abb\u00e9 accompanied him to the door. \u201cYou are a great almsgiver,\u201d said the visitor, \u201cand although you are said to be rich, I will venture to offer you something for your poor people; will you accept my offering?\u201d \u201cI thank you, sir; I am only jealous in one thing, and that is that the relief I give should be entirely from my own resources.\u201d \u201cHowever\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cMy resolution, sir, is unchangeable, but you have only to search for yourself and you will find, alas, but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence.\u201d The abb\u00e9 once more bowed as he opened the door, the stranger bowed and took his leave, and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of M. de Villefort. An hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered, and this time it went to the Rue Fontaine-Saint-Georges, and stopped at No. 5, where Lord Wilmore lived. The stranger had written to Lord Wilmore, requesting an interview, which the latter had fixed for ten o\u2019clock. As the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten, he was told that Lord Wilmore, who was precision and punctuality personified, was not yet come in, but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck."], "When Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s coaxes Monte Cristo into the garden at Morcerf\u2019s ball, what does she try to convince him to do?": [" Albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother\u2019s bed.

You are of so superior a mind, nothing escapes you.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d \u201cBecause, for instance, you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave, that M. de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house.\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s raised herself on her feverish arm. \u201cM. de Monte Cristo!\u201d she exclaimed; \u201cand how is he connected with the question you asked me?\u201d 40219m \u201cYou know, mother, M. de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental, and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies.\u201d \u201cDo you say M. de Monte Cristo is our enemy?\u201d replied Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, becoming paler than the sheet which covered her. \u201cWho told you so? Why, you are mad, Albert! M. de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness. M. de Monte Cristo saved your life; you yourself presented him to us. Oh, I entreat you, my son, if you had entertained such an idea, dispel it; and my counsel to you\u2014nay, my prayer\u2014is to retain his friendship.\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d replied the young man, \u201cyou have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man.\u201d \u201cI?\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale, and again becoming paler than ever.", " The worn out steps were old acquaintances of his; he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather-beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within. He entered without knocking, or giving any other intimation of his presence, as if he had been a friend or the master of the place. At the end of a passage paved with bricks, was a little garden, bathed in sunshine, and rich in warmth and light. In this garden Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s had found, at the place indicated by the count, the sum of money which he, through a sense of delicacy, had described as having been placed there twenty-four years previously. The trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street-door. Monte Cristo, on stepping into the house, heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob; he looked in the direction whence it came, and there under an arbor of Virginia jessamine,29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers, he saw Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s seated, with her head bowed, and weeping bitterly. She had raised her veil, and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son. Monte Cristo advanced a few steps, which were heard on the gravel. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s raised her head, and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her. 50211m \u201cMadame,\u201d said the count, \u201cit is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness, but I offer you consolation; will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend?\u201d \u201cI am, indeed, most wretched,\u201d replied Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.", " A minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open, and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns, and the supper laid under the tent. Dancers, players, talkers, all uttered an exclamation of joy\u2014everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in. At the same time Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s reappeared, paler than before, but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore. She went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre. \u201cDo not detain those gentlemen here, count,\u201d she said; \u201cthey would prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here, since they are not playing.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung _Partant pour la Syrie_,\u2014\u201cwe will not go alone to the garden.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, \u201cI will lead the way.\u201d Turning towards Monte Cristo, she added, \u201ccount, will you oblige me with your arm?\u201d The count almost staggered at these simple words; then he fixed his eyes on Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. It was only a momentary glance, but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century, so much was expressed in that one look. He offered his arm to the countess; she took it, or rather just touched it with her little hand, and they together descended the steps, lined with rhododendrons and camellias. Behind them, by another outlet, a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight.", " Baptistin looked at his master, who made a sign to him, and he went out, closing the door after him. \u201cWho are you, madame?\u201d said the count to the veiled woman. 40227m The stranger cast one look around her, to be certain that they were quite alone; then bending as if she would have knelt, and joining her hands, she said with an accent of despair: \u201cEdmond, you will not kill my son!\u201d The count retreated a step, uttered a slight exclamation, and let fall the pistol he held. \u201cWhat name did you pronounce then, Madame de Morcerf?\u201d said he. \u201cYours!\u201d cried she, throwing back her veil,\u2014\u201cyours, which I alone, perhaps, have not forgotten.

Then he determined to go up. Noirtier\u2019s room was opened, like all the rest. The first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place, but his eyes expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features. \u201cHow are you, sir?\u201d asked Morrel, with a sickness of heart. \u201cWell,\u201d answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness. \u201cYou are thoughtful, sir,\u201d continued Morrel; \u201cyou want something; shall I call one of the servants?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Noirtier.

But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments, _qu\u00e6rens quem devoret_. There was, indeed, reason to retreat, to be alarmed, and to scream. An officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards Danglars, preceded by a commissary of police, girded with his scarf. Madame Danglars uttered a scream and fainted.", " He bowed politely to the baroness, familiarly to Danglars, and affectionately to Monte Cristo. Then turning to the baroness: \u201cMay I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is?\u201d said he. \u201cShe is quite well,\u201d replied Danglars quickly; \u201cshe is at the piano with M.

You were not of the party, M. de Morcerf?\u201d \u201cWhat prince?\u201d asked Albert. \u201cPrince Cavalcanti,\u201d said Danglars, who persisted in giving the young man that title. \u201cPardon me,\u201d said Albert, \u201cI was not aware that he was a prince.

Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say. Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly\u2019s fingers, and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantio\u2019s malediction on Desdemona. At the end of the piece \u00c9tienne entered, and announced to Eug\u00e9nie that the horses were to the carriage, and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits.

The Contract Three days after the scene we have just described, namely towards five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eug\u00e9nie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti, whom the banker persisted in calling prince, a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristo\u2019s house, and the count was preparing to go out.", " The latter took in the whole scene at a glance. The baroness was partially reclining on a sofa, Eug\u00e9nie sat near her, and Cavalcanti was standing. Cavalcanti, dressed in black, like one of Goethe\u2019s heroes, with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked stockings, passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his light hair, and so displayed a sparkling diamond, that in spite of Monte Cristo\u2019s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger. This movement was accompanied by killing glances at Mademoiselle Danglars, and by sighs launched in the same direction. Mademoiselle Danglars was still the same\u2014cold, beautiful, and satirical. Not one of these glances, nor one sigh, was lost on her; they might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva, which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sappho. Eug\u00e9nie bowed coldly to the count, and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study, whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars preferred to his society and to that of M. Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise d\u2019Armilly, her singing teacher. It was then, especially while conversing with Madame Danglars, and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation, that the count noticed M.

Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert\u2019s wish to be introduced to Hayd\u00e9e, and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Hayd\u00e9e\u2019s recital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf\u2019s father). Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father\u2019s name before Hayd\u00e9e? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father\u2019s enemies. Albert took Beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him. \u201cYou are right,\u201d said the latter; \u201cM.

The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army, went to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general. \u201cFernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a captain in 1823, during the Spanish war\u2014that is to say, at the time when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.\u201d \u201cDestiny!"], "Who dies after taking a drink of Noirtier\u2019s lemonade?": [" You see this is a fit of apoplexy, and he might be saved if he could but be bled!\u201d \u201cHas he eaten anything lately?\u201d asked Madame de Villefort, eluding her husband\u2019s question. \u201cMadame,\u201d replied Valentine, \u201che has not even breakfasted.

She cried out, but d\u2019Avrigny paid no attention to her; possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four steps with a bound, and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter, where it had been left.

Look closely!\u201d The doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue shade, then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and from opal to emerald. Arrived at this last hue, it changed no more. The result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind. \u201cThe unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned,\u201d said d\u2019Avrigny, \u201cand I will maintain this assertion before God and man.\u201d Villefort said nothing, but he clasped his hands, opened his haggard eyes, and, overcome with his emotion, sank into a chair.

Set out immediately for Paris, and demand of the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, No. 30, the son whom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari, and who was taken from you at five years of age. This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti. In order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter, you will find enclosed an order for 2,400 francs, payable in Florence, at Signor Gozzi\u2019s; also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo, on whom I give you a draft of 48,000 francs.

He found his carriage at the door, and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp, who was in his office. It was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as journalists\u2019 offices have always been from time immemorial. The servant announced M. Albert de Morcerf. Beauchamp repeated the name to himself, as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright, and then gave orders for him to be admitted. Albert entered. Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room. \u201cThis way, this way, my dear Albert!\u201d said he, holding out his hand to the young man. \u201cAre you out of your senses, or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me?

Albert, however, felt no less insulted; the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult. Besides, the manner in which Beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart. He cherished the thought of the duel, hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds. Beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited Albert, and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days. Where he was no one knew. One morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre, who announced Beauchamp. Albert rubbed his eyes, ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking-room on the ground floor, dressed himself quickly, and went down. He found Beauchamp pacing the room; on perceiving him Beauchamp stopped. \u201cYour arrival here, without waiting my visit at your house today, looks well, sir,\u201d said Albert. \u201cTell me, may I shake hands with you, saying, \u2018Beauchamp, acknowledge you have injured me, and retain my friendship,\u2019 or must I simply propose to you a choice of arms?\u201d \u201cAlbert,\u201d said Beauchamp, with a look of sorrow which stupefied the young man, \u201clet us first sit down and talk.\u201d \u201cRather, sir, before we sit down, I must demand your answer.\u201d \u201cAlbert,\u201d said the journalist, \u201cthese are questions which it is difficult to answer.\u201d \u201cI will facilitate it by repeating the question, \u2018Will you, or will you not, retract?\u2019\u201d \u201cMorcerf, it is not enough to answer \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to questions which concern the honor, the social interest, and the life of such a man as Lieutenant-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral the Count of Morcerf, peer of France.\u201d \u201cWhat must then be done?\u201d 40174m \u201cWhat I have done, Albert.", " \u201cCount, count!\u201d said he. \u201cDear Maximilian,\u201d interrupted the count, \u201clisten how adorably Duprez is singing that line,\u2014 \u2018O Mathilde! idole de mon \u00e2me!\u2019 \u201cI was the first to discover Duprez at Naples, and the first to applaud him. Bravo, bravo!\u201d Morrel saw it was useless to say more, and refrained. The curtain, which had risen at the close of the scene with Albert, again fell, and a rap was heard at the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion; and immediately Beauchamp appeared. \u201cGood-evening, M.

I am happy to see, M. Beauchamp, that you are more sober than he was.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said M. Beauchamp, \u201cAlbert was wrong, I acknowledge, to betray so much anger, and I come, on my own account, to apologize for him. And having done so, entirely on my own account, be it understood, I would add that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with Yanina. Then I will add two words about the young Greek girl.\u201d Monte Cristo motioned him to be silent. \u201cCome,\u201d said he, laughing, \u201cthere are all my hopes about to be destroyed.\u201d \u201cHow so?\u201d asked Beauchamp."], "How long do Albert and Monte Cristo spend in Normandy before a letter arrives from Beauchamp summoning Albert to Paris?": [" Baptiste, give me yesterday\u2019s paper,\u201d cried Beauchamp. \u201cHere, I have brought mine with me,\u201d replied Albert. Beauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which Albert pointed in an undertone. \u201cYou see it is a serious annoyance,\u201d said Morcerf, when Beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph. \u201cIs the officer referred to a relation of yours, then?\u201d demanded the journalist. \u201cYes,\u201d said Albert, blushing. \u201cWell, what do you wish me to do for you?\u201d said Beauchamp mildly. \u201cMy dear Beauchamp, I wish you to contradict this statement.\u201d Beauchamp looked at Albert with a benevolent expression. \u201cCome,\u201d said he, \u201cthis matter will want a good deal of talking over; a retractation is always a serious thing, you know. Sit down, and I will read it again.\u201d Albert resumed his seat, and Beauchamp read, with more attention than at first, the lines denounced by his friend. \u201cWell,\u201d said Albert in a determined tone, \u201cyou see that your paper has insulted a member of my family, and I insist on a retractation being made.\u201d \u201cYou insist?\u201d \u201cYes, I insist.\u201d \u201cPermit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber, my dear viscount.\u201d \u201cNor do I wish to be there,\u201d replied the young man, rising. \u201cI repeat that I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted. You have known me long enough,\u201d continued Albert, biting his lips convulsively, for he saw that Beauchamp\u2019s anger was beginning to rise,\u2014\u201cyou have been my friend, and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this point.\u201d \u201cIf I have been your friend, Morcerf, your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title.", " No one had taken up the remark about the general, and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble count in the House of Peers.

Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert\u2019s wish to be introduced to Hayd\u00e9e, and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Hayd\u00e9e\u2019s recital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf\u2019s father). Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father\u2019s name before Hayd\u00e9e? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father\u2019s enemies. Albert took Beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him. \u201cYou are right,\u201d said the latter; \u201cM. Danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair, and it is of M. de Monte Cristo that you must demand an explanation.\u201d Albert turned. \u201cSir,\u201d said he to Danglars, \u201cunderstand that I do not take a final leave of you; I must ascertain if your insinuations are just, and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo.\u201d He bowed to the banker, and went out with Beauchamp, without appearing to notice Cavalcanti. Danglars accompanied him to the door, where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the Count of Morcerf.", " M. Beauchamp, it holds four very well, will you accompany us?\u201d \u201cThank you, I have just returned from sea.\u201d \u201cWhat? you have been to sea?\u201d \u201cYes; I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean Islands18.\u201d \u201cWhat of that? come with us,\u201d said Albert. \u201cNo, dear Morcerf; you know I only refuse when the thing is impossible. Besides, it is important,\u201d added he in a low tone, \u201cthat I should remain in Paris just now to watch the paper.\u201d \u201cAh, you are a good and an excellent friend,\u201d said Albert; \u201cyes, you are right; watch, watch, Beauchamp, and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure.\u201d Albert and Beauchamp parted, the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger. \u201cBeauchamp is a worthy fellow,\u201d said Monte Cristo, when the journalist was gone; \u201cis he not, Albert?\u201d \u201cYes, and a sincere friend; I love him devotedly.

He is my master, and I am his slave; he has the right to notice nothing.\u201d The count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart; his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy. \u201cOh, heavens,\u201d exclaimed Monte Cristo, \u201ccan my suspicions be correct?

Doubtless, although less evident, Monte Cristo\u2019s joy was not less intense. Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is outwardly apparent. Monte Cristo was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time dared to believe, that there were two Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s in the world, and he might yet be happy.

Then, turning towards Albert,\u2014\u201cIt is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern Greek, both of which Hayd\u00e9e speaks so fluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian, which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation.\u201d The count made a sign to Hayd\u00e9e to address his visitor.", " Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage. \u201cStop, gentlemen,\u201d said Albert; \u201cI have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo.\u201d \u201cIn private?\u201d asked Morrel. \u201cNo, sir; before all who are here.\u201d Albert\u2019s witnesses looked at each other.

The Past The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation which had just taken place between Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them. A man of the count\u2019s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys superior ones. He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself.", " But she had her son. Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them. Excitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth. But the excitement had calmed down, and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having exhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual. \u201cMother,\u201d exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was descending the stairs, \u201clet us reckon our riches, if you please; I want capital to build my plans upon.\u201d \u201cCapital\u2014nothing!\u201d replied Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s with a mournful smile. \u201cNo, mother,\u2014capital 3,000 francs.

These 3,000 francs are enormous, and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future.\u201d \u201cYou say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these 3,000 francs?\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, coloring. \u201cI think so,\u201d answered Albert in a firm tone. \u201cWe will accept them the more readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the All\u00e9es de Meilhan, at Marseilles.

Why, you are mad, Albert! M. de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness. M. de Monte Cristo saved your life; you yourself presented him to us.

Conspiracy Danglars followed Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas; then, turning round, he perceived Fernand, who had fallen, pale and trembling, into his chair, while Caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking-song. \u201cWell, my dear sir,\u201d said Danglars to Fernand, \u201chere is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy.\u201d \u201cIt drives me to despair,\u201d said Fernand. \u201cDo you, then, love Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s?\u201d \u201cI adore her!\u201d \u201cFor long?\u201d \u201cAs long as I have known her\u2014always.\u201d \u201cAnd you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy your condition; I did not think that was the way of your people.\u201d \u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d said Fernand. \u201cHow do I know? Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s; but for you\u2014in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall find.\u201d \u201cI have found already.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.\u201d \u201cPooh!

The Bourbons left him quietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy was made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was older than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent to the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active army, went to the frontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general was to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him; Fernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general. \u201cFernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on the throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to France with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a captain in 1823, during the Spanish war\u2014that is to say, at the time when Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and being sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen, found Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief campaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of Honor.\u201d \u201cDestiny!", " \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,\u201d replied Caderousse. \u201cGo on,\u201d said the abb\u00e9; \u201cit seems as if I were listening to the story of a dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.\u201d \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de Villefort, her devotion to the elder Dant\u00e8s. In the midst of her despair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of Fernand\u2014of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded as her brother. Fernand went, and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s remained alone. \u201cThree months passed and still she wept\u2014no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand, no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair. One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her. \u201cIt was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her. \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s seized Fernand\u2019s hands with a transport which he took for love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow."], "After her marriage to Andrea Cavalcanti is announced, what does Eug\u00e9nie proclaim that she would rather do?": [" M.

Hayd\u00e9e Scarcely had the count\u2019s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard, when Albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of laughter\u2014much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, \u201cI will ask you the same question which Charles IX. put to Catherine de\u2019 Medici, after the massacre of Saint Bartholomew: \u2018How have I played my little part?\u2019\u201d \u201cTo what do you allude?\u201d asked Monte Cristo. \u201cTo the installation of my rival at M.

He aspires to the hand of the proud Eug\u00e9nie.\u201d \u201cWhat does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?\u201d \u201cBut it is not the case, my dear count: on the contrary. I am repulsed on all sides.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d \u201cIt is so indeed; Mademoiselle Eug\u00e9nie scarcely answers me, and Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly, her confidant, does not speak to me at all.\u201d \u201cBut the father has the greatest regard possible for you,\u201d said Monte Cristo.", " But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti. It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young man was received at the banker\u2019s as the betrothed. Letters had been despatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count\u2019s father, who highly approved of the union, regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time, and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres. It was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to invest; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father-in-law, who had of late sustained repeated losses; but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron. The baron adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti; not so Mademoiselle Eug\u00e9nie Danglars. With an instinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered Andrea\u2019s attentions in order to get rid of Morcerf; but when Andrea urged his suit, she betrayed an entire dislike to him.

Cavalcanti in that room, where he, the betrothed of Eug\u00e9nie, has never been admitted.\u201d \u201cYou may well say, perchance,\u201d replied the banker; \u201cfor he comes so seldom, it would seem only chance that brings him.\u201d \u201cBut should he come and find that young man with your daughter, he might be displeased.\u201d \u201cHe?

Now, Madame Danglars feared Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s sagacity and the influence of Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon Debray,\u2014an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother\u2019s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she saw that Eug\u00e9nie detested Debray, not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men, and whom Diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers. Unfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through a certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as others, and Madame Danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the marriage of Eug\u00e9nie had not taken place, not only because the match was good, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it would also set her at liberty.", " But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti.

Besides, he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and as to suitability, M.

My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares, or the caprices of any man, but to be an artist, and consequently free in heart, in person, and in thought.\u201d Eug\u00e9nie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentine\u2019s cheeks.", " what more do you want?\u201d \u201cI wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely free in my person?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d \u201cThen, as I said before, sir,\u2014very well; I am ready to marry M.

Eug\u00e9nie, apparently calm, although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual, went out in her turn. A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two young girls, having told him to take it to No. 36, Rue de la Victoire, walked behind this man, whose presence comforted Louise. As for Eug\u00e9nie, she was as strong as a Judith or a Delilah. They arrived at the appointed spot. Eug\u00e9nie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau, gave him some pieces of money, and having rapped at the shutter sent him away. The shutter where Eug\u00e9nie had rapped was that of a little laundress, who had been previously warned, and was not yet gone to bed. She opened the door. \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said Eug\u00e9nie, \u201clet the porter get the post-chaise from the coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the hotel.

In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post-boy and horses, which were harnessed, and put in the post-chaise in a minute, while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap. \u201cHere is the passport,\u201d said the postilion, \u201cwhich way are we going, young gentleman?\u201d \u201cTo Fontainebleau,\u201d replied Eug\u00e9nie with an almost masculine voice.", " Instead of living the retired baker, you might live as a bankrupt, using his privileges; that would be very good.\u201d \u201cBut how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?\u201d \u201cAh, Caderousse,\u201d said Andrea, \u201chow covetous you are! Two months ago you were dying with hunger.\u201d \u201cThe appetite grows by what it feeds on,\u201d said Caderousse, grinning and showing his teeth, like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling. \u201cAnd,\u201d added he, biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread, \u201cI have formed a plan.\u201d Caderousse\u2019s plans alarmed Andrea still more than his ideas; ideas were but the germ, the plan was reality. \u201cLet me see your plan; I dare say it is a pretty one.\u201d \u201cWhy not? Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of M\u2014\u2014! eh? was it not I? and it was no bad one I believe, since here we are!\u201d \u201cI do not say,\u201d replied Andrea, \u201cthat you never make a good one; but let us see your plan.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d pursued Caderousse, \u201ccan you without expending one sou, put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs? No, fifteen thousand are not enough,\u2014I cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Andrea, dryly, \u201cno, I cannot.\u201d \u201cI do not think you understand me,\u201d replied Caderousse, calmly; \u201cI said without your laying out a sou.\u201d \u201cDo you want me to commit a robbery, to spoil all my good fortune\u2014and yours with mine\u2014and both of us to be dragged down there again?\u201d \u201cIt would make very little difference to me,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cif I were retaken, I am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine for my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be glad never to see them again.\u201d Andrea did more than tremble this time, he turned pale."], "As gendarmes surround Benedetto\u2019s hotel room, how does he escape?": [" Dant\u00e8s made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream; he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a door, and that the door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as through a mist. He did not even see the ocean, that terrible barrier against freedom, which the prisoners look upon with utter despair. They halted for a minute, during which he strove to collect his thoughts. He looked around; he was in a court surrounded by high walls; he heard the measured tread of sentinels, and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine. They waited upwards of ten minutes. Certain Dant\u00e8s could not escape, the gendarmes released him. They seemed awaiting orders. The orders came. \u201cWhere is the prisoner?\u201d said a voice. \u201cHere,\u201d replied the gendarmes. \u201cLet him follow me; I will take him to his cell.\u201d \u201cGo!\u201d said the gendarmes, thrusting Dant\u00e8s forward. The prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under ground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly, and showed Dant\u00e8s the features of his conductor, an under-jailer, ill-clothed, and of sullen appearance. 0113m \u201cHere is your chamber for tonight,\u201d said he. \u201cIt is late, and the governor is asleep.

You succeeded, and then God snatched it from you, and brought you to justice.\u201d \u201cIt was not I who wished to kill the Jew,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cit was La Carconte.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cand God,\u2014I cannot say in justice, for his justice would have slain you,\u2014but God, in his mercy, spared your life.\u201d \u201c_Pardieu!_ to transport me for life, how merciful!\u201d \u201cYou thought it a mercy then, miserable wretch! The coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace; for like all galley-slaves, you said, \u2018I may escape from prison, I cannot from the grave.\u2019 And you said truly; the way was opened for you unexpectedly. An Englishman visited Toulon, who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy, and his choice fell on you and your companion. You received a second fortune, money and tranquillity were restored to you, and you, who had been condemned to a felon\u2019s life, might live as other men. Then, wretched creature, then you tempted God a third time. \u2018I have not enough,\u2019 you said, when you had more than you before possessed, and you committed a third crime, without reason, without excuse.

He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued, and having reached it, he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone. At the same minute, one of the little windows of the H\u00f4tel de Ville was thrown open, and the head of a gendarme appeared. For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building, then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared. The brigadier, calm and dignified as the law he represented, passed through the crowd, without answering the thousand questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel. \u201cWell?\u201d asked the two gendarmes. \u201cWell, my boys,\u201d said the brigadier, \u201cthe brigand must really have escaped early this morning; but we will send to the Villers-Coterets and Noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no doubt.\u201d The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a loud scream, accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded through the court of the hotel. \u201cAh, what is that?\u201d cried the brigadier. \u201cSome traveller seems impatient,\u201d said the host. \u201cWhat number was it that rang?\u201d \u201cNumber 3.\u201d \u201cRun, waiter!\u201d At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.", " Compi\u00e8gne, that royal residence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities, gendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the Bell and Bottle being the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed their first inquiries there. Now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the H\u00f4tel de Ville, which is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night. The sentinel who was relieved at six o\u2019clock in the morning, remembered perfectly that, just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four, a young man arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him. The young man, having dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel, which was opened, and again closed after his entrance. This late arrival had attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other than Andrea, the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed their steps towards his room. They found the door ajar. \u201cOh, oh,\u201d said the brigadier, who thoroughly understood the trick; \u201ca bad sign to find the door open! I would rather find it triply bolted.\u201d And, indeed, the little note and pin upon the table confirmed, or rather corroborated, the sad truth. Andrea had fled.

Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine summoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep. \u201cValentine!\u201d said a low voice. The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply. \u201cValentine,\u201d repeated the same voice. Still silent: Valentine had promised not to wake. Then everything was still, excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she ventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw a woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass. During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept: it was Madame de Villefort. On recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder, which caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains, she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of Valentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife.", " \u201cI imagined it must be,\u201d said Morrel. Valentine looked at the young man; they heard the street door close, then M. de Villefort locked the garden door, and returned upstairs. He stopped a moment in the anteroom, as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame de Saint-M\u00e9ran\u2019s; Morrel concealed himself behind a door; Valentine remained motionless, grief seeming to deprive her of all fear. M. de Villefort passed on to his own room. \u201cNow,\u201d said Valentine, \u201cyou can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden.\u201d Morrel looked at her with astonishment. \u201cThere is but one way left you that is safe,\u201d said she; \u201cit is through my grandfather\u2019s room.\u201d She rose. \u201cCome,\u201d she added. \u201cWhere?\u201d asked Maximilian. \u201cTo my grandfather\u2019s room.\u201d \u201cI in M.

Are you sure you are more reasonable?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Valentine; \u201cand I have but one scruple,\u2014that of leaving my dear grandmother\u2019s remains, which I had undertaken to watch.\u201d \u201cValentine,\u201d said Morrel, \u201cdeath is in itself sacred.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Valentine; \u201cbesides, it will not be for long.\u201d She then crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase to M. Noirtier\u2019s room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they found the old servant.", " About this time the nurse\u2019s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand. To the tender eye of a father or a lover, the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentine\u2019s condition; but to this hireling, Valentine only appeared to sleep. \u201cGood,\u201d she exclaimed, approaching the table, \u201cshe has taken part of her draught; the glass is three-quarters empty.\u201d Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire, and although she had just left her bed, she could not resist the temptation offered by Valentine\u2019s sleep, so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest. The clock striking eight awoke her. Astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and for the first time noticed the white lips. She tried to replace the arm, but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick-nurse. She screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed: \u201cHelp, help!\u201d 50083m \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d asked M. d\u2019Avrigny, at the foot of the stairs, it being the hour he usually visited her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Villefort, rushing from his room. \u201cDoctor, do you hear them call for help?\u201d \u201cYes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in Valentine\u2019s room.\u201d But before the doctor and the father could reach the room, the servants who were on the same floor had entered, and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her bed, they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed, as though struck by lightening.", " Valentine found her grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung sobs, broken sighs, burning tears, were all that passed in this sad interview, while Madame de Villefort, leaning on her husband\u2019s arm, maintained all outward forms of respect, at least towards the poor widow. She soon whispered to her husband: \u201cI think it would be better for me to retire, with your permission, for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother-in-law.\u201d Madame de Saint-M\u00e9ran heard her. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d she said softly to Valentine, \u201clet her leave; but do you stay.\u201d Madame de Villefort left, and Valentine remained alone beside the bed, for the procureur, overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death, had followed his wife. Meanwhile, Barrois had returned for the first time to old Noirtier, who having heard the noise in the house, had, as we have said, sent his old servant to inquire the cause; on his return, his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger. \u201cAlas, sir,\u201d exclaimed Barrois, \u201ca great misfortune has happened. Madame de Saint-M\u00e9ran has arrived, and her husband is dead!\u201d M. de Saint-M\u00e9ran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably affects another. Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest, apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of inquiry. Barrois asked, \u201cMademoiselle Valentine?\u201d Noirtier nodded his head."], "In which cemetery does Valentine\u2019s funeral take place?": [" The day after the event, she decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they are gone to seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain.\u201d \u201cOh, it is terrible!\u201d and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation, after expressing acute sympathy with the father. But he had scarcely left before Danglars, with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick,24 exclaimed: \u201cFool!\u201d Then enclosing Monte Cristo\u2019s receipt in a little pocket-book, he added:\u2014\u201cYes, come at twelve o\u2019clock; I shall then be far away.\u201d Then he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers, collected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes, burned several papers, left others exposed to view, and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed: \u201cTo Madame la Baronne Danglars.\u201d \u201cI will place it on her table myself tonight,\u201d he murmured. Then taking a passport from his drawer he said,\u2014\u201cGood, it is available for two months longer.\u201d Chapter 105. The Cemetery of P\u00e8re-Lachaise M. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last home on earth. The weather was dull and stormy, a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees, and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards. M. de Villefort, a true Parisian, considered the cemetery of P\u00e8re-Lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates.", " At length they arrived at the cemetery. The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees, and was soon relieved from all anxiety, for seeing a shadow glide between the yew-trees, Monte Cristo recognized him whom he sought. One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis. Black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments; then follows the melancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then with a sob of anguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers. The shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of Ab\u00e9lard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse, placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse, and following the undertaker\u2019s men, arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial. Each person\u2019s attention was occupied. Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow, which no one else observed. Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes. When the procession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with his coat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation.", " Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm; then, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable terror, she awaited the event. Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains.

The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife.", " Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange coincidence, this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de Saint-M\u00e9ran, and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two. Their number was great. The Marquis de Saint-M\u00e9ran, one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII. and King Charles X., had preserved a great number of friends, and these, added to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a claim on, formed a considerable body. Due information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second hearse, decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de Villefort\u2019s door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon. The two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of P\u00e8re-Lachaise, where M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family. The remains of poor Ren\u00e9e were already deposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father and mother were to be reunited with her. The Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display, looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy\u2014the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles.

Monte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with someone and begged Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room. While the banker was waiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abb\u00e9 and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and instead of waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments, and disappeared. A minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened, and Monte Cristo appeared. \u201cPardon me,\u201d said he, \u201cmy dear baron, but one of my friends, the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, whom you perhaps saw pass by, has just arrived in Paris; not having seen him for a long time, I could not make up my mind to leave him sooner, so I hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait.\u201d \u201cNay,\u201d said Danglars, \u201cit is my fault; I have chosen my visit at a wrong time, and will retire.\u201d \u201cNot at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter with you?

Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed; he bowed to Morcerf, who replied with the most impertinent look possible. Then Albert launched out in praise of Mademoiselle Danglars\u2019 voice, and on his regret, after what he had just heard, that he had been unable to be present the previous evening. Cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo. \u201cCome,\u201d said Madame Danglars, \u201cleave music and compliments, and let us go and take tea.\u201d \u201cCome, Louise,\u201d said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend. They passed into the next drawing-room, where tea was prepared. Just as they were beginning, in the English fashion, to leave the spoons in their cups, the door again opened and Danglars entered, visibly agitated. Monte Cristo observed it particularly, and by a look asked the banker for an explanation. \u201cI have just received my courier from Greece,\u201d said Danglars. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d said the count; \u201cthat was the reason of your running away from us.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHow is King Otho getting on?\u201d asked Albert in the most sprightly tone.

He had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries, which, on rising suddenly, he let fall from his hand. \u201cYou are gathering your crop, sir?\u201d said Monte Cristo, smiling. 30193m \u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d replied the man, raising his hand to his cap; \u201cI am not up there, I know, but I have only just come down.\u201d \u201cDo not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend,\u201d said the count; \u201cgather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any left.\u201d \u201cI have ten left,\u201d said the man, \u201cfor here are eleven, and I had twenty-one, five more than last year. But I am not surprised; the spring has been warm this year, and strawberries require heat, sir. This is the reason that, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have this year, you see, eleven, already plucked\u2014twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Ah, I miss three, they were here last night, sir\u2014I am sure they were here\u2014I counted them.", " \u201cBut you are deceived, Edmond,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou have no enemy here\u2014there is no one but Fernand, my brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.\u201d And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and offered him his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave, was broken against the strong ascendancy which Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s exercised over him. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmond\u2019s hand when he felt he had done all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house. \u201cOh,\u201d he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair\u2014\u201cOh, who will deliver me from this man? Wretched\u2014wretched that I am!\u201d \u201cHallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?\u201d exclaimed a voice. The young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor. \u201cWell\u201d, said Caderousse, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you come? Are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?\u201d \u201cParticularly when they have still a full bottle before them,\u201d added Danglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not say a word. \u201cHe seems besotted,\u201d said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee. \u201cAre we mistaken, and is Dant\u00e8s triumphant in spite of all we have believed?\u201d \u201cWhy, we must inquire into that,\u201d was Caderousse\u2019s reply; and turning towards the young man, said, \u201cWell, Catalan, can\u2019t you make up your mind?\u201d Fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body.", " \u201cOh, oh!\u201d said Andrea, \u201cyou need not be ashamed, even though you did post after me. Was I not nearly your husband?\u201d 50056m And with this raillery Andrea went out, leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame, and to the comments of the crowd. An hour after they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire. The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but they were forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices. Eug\u00e9nie closed her eyes; but though she could not see, she could hear, and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage. \u201cOh, why is not the world a wilderness?\u201d she exclaimed, throwing herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly, her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world had but one neck, that he might sever it at a single blow. The next day they stopped at the H\u00f4tel de Flandre, at Brussels. The same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie. Chapter 99. The Law We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs.

Thank God, I have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and believe he is dead.\u201d \u201cDo not think so, Bertuccio,\u201d replied the count; \u201cfor the wicked are not so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under his special watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.\u201d \u201cSo be it,\u201d responded Bertuccio, \u201call I ask of heaven is that I may never see him again.

Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you, and, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly punished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but one point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore, after rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its mother? There was the crime, Bertuccio\u2014that was where you became really culpable.\u201d \u201cTrue, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that I acted like a coward.", " \u201cWaiting for whom?\u201d Bertuccio, without answering, pointed to Villefort with something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo. \u201cOh, oh!\u201d he at length muttered, \u201cdo you see?\u201d \u201cWhat?

The unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne with the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by degrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from being naked, dirty, and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector\u2019s voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt his heart leap with joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or the doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M. Bertuccio, who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars, the bolted doors, and the shadow which moved behind the other grating. \u201cAh,\u201d said Andrea, deeply affected. \u201cGood morning, Benedetto,\u201d said Bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice. \u201cYou\u2014you?\u201d said the young man, looking fearfully around him. \u201cDo you not recognize me, unhappy child?\u201d \u201cSilence,\u2014be silent!\u201d said Andrea, who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls; \u201cfor Heaven\u2019s sake, do not speak so loud!\u201d \u201cYou wish to speak with me alone, do you not?\u201d said Bertuccio."], "On the day of Benedetto\u2019s trial, what does Villefort instruct his wife to do?": [" \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d he said. \u201cI am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer. If I find you alive on my return, you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie.\u201d Madame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the carpet. The king\u2019s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity; he looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly: \u201cFarewell, madame, farewell!\u201d That farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner\u2019s knife. She fainted. The procureur went out, after having double-locked the door. Chapter 109. The Assizes The Benedetto affair, as it was called at the Palais, and by people in general, had produced a tremendous sensation. Frequenting the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his brief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as the man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains. In the eyes of many, Benedetto appeared, if not a victim to, at least an instance of, the fallibility of the law. M. Cavalcanti, his father, had been seen in Paris, and it was expected that he would re-appear to claim the illustrious outcast.", " Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him the papers, and with them a cup of chocolate. \u201cWhat are you bringing me?\u201d said he. \u201cA cup of chocolate.\u201d \u201cI did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?\u201d \u201cMy mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case, and that you should take something to keep up your strength;\u201d and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers. The valet then left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion, he swallowed its contents at one draught. It might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil. He then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness. The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort felt no effects. The breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The valet re-entered. \u201cMadame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cthat eleven o\u2019clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Villefort, \u201cwhat then?\u201d \u201cMadame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know if she is to accompany you, sir?\u201d \u201cWhere to?\u201d \u201cTo the Palais.\u201d \u201cWhat to do?\u201d \u201cMy mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Villefort, with a startling accent; \u201cdoes she wish that?\u201d The servant drew back and said, \u201cIf you wish to go alone, sir, I will go and tell my mistress.\u201d Villefort remained silent for a moment, and dented his pale cheeks with his nails.", " \u201cOh, you do not know what is seventeen months in prison!\u2014seventeen ages rather, especially to a man who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition\u2014to a man, who, like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant\u2014who sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living!

As for Benedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket-handkerchief. \u201cYour profession?\u201d \u201cFirst I was a forger,\u201d answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; \u201cthen I became a thief, and lately have become an assassin.\u201d A murmur, or rather storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly. The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion. M. de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at first pale, had become red and burning; then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senses\u2014he wanted air. 50183m \u201cAre you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?\u201d asked Benedetto, with his most ingratiating smile. M. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or rather threw himself down again upon his chair. \u201cAnd now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?\u201d said the president. \u201cThe brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to humanity. You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be for this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name."], "During Benedetto\u2019s highly public trial, he announces that he is the son of ___.": [" \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d he said. \u201cI am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer. If I find you alive on my return, you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie.\u201d Madame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the carpet. The king\u2019s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity; he looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly: \u201cFarewell, madame, farewell!\u201d That farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner\u2019s knife. She fainted. The procureur went out, after having double-locked the door. Chapter 109. The Assizes The Benedetto affair, as it was called at the Palais, and by people in general, had produced a tremendous sensation. Frequenting the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his brief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as the man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains. In the eyes of many, Benedetto appeared, if not a victim to, at least an instance of, the fallibility of the law. M. Cavalcanti, his father, had been seen in Paris, and it was expected that he would re-appear to claim the illustrious outcast.", " We may well pity the poor fellows!\u201d said the abb\u00e9. \u201cNay,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cone can\u2019t always work\u2014one is not a dog.\u201d \u201cSo much the better for the dogs,\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cWhile the rest slept, then, we went away a short distance; we severed our fetters with a file the Englishman had given us, and swam away.\u201d \u201cAnd what is become of this Benedetto?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cYou ought to know.\u201d \u201cNo, in truth; we parted at Hy\u00e8res.\u201d And, to give more weight to his protestation, Caderousse advanced another step towards the abb\u00e9, who remained motionless in his place, as calm as ever, and pursuing his interrogation. \u201cYou lie,\u201d said the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, with a tone of irresistible authority. \u201cReverend sir!\u201d \u201cYou lie!

Benedetto, you are fallen into terrible hands; they are ready to open for you\u2014make use of them.

Well, I have not intercepted your confidence, and yet I know all that as well as you, and I have no conscientious scruples. No, it does not concern me.

To enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife. To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb. His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth. \u201cEdward!\u201d he stammered\u2014\u201cEdward!\u201d The child did not answer. Where, then, could he be, if he had entered his mother\u2019s room and not since returned? He stepped forward. The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which Edward must be; those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold, and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony. Through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch.", " Edward raised his head, looked at his mother, and then, finding that she did not confirm the order, began cutting off the heads of his leaden soldiers. \u201cEdward,\u201d cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up from the floor, \u201cdo you hear me?\u2014Go!\u201d The child, unaccustomed to such treatment, arose, pale and trembling; it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion. His father went up to him, took him in his arms, and kissed his forehead. \u201cGo,\u201d he said: \u201cgo, my child.\u201d Edward ran out. M. de Villefort went to the door, which he closed behind the child, and bolted. \u201cDear me!\u201d said the young woman, endeavoring to read her husband\u2019s inmost thoughts, while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of Villefort; \u201cwhat is the matter?\u201d \u201cMadame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?\u201d said the magistrate, without any introduction, placing himself between his wife and the door. Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its head. A hoarse, broken tone, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from her, while she became deadly pale. \u201cMonsieur,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2014I do not understand you.\u201d And, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised herself from the sofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other, she fell down again on the cushions.", " \u201cNot here,\u201d he said; \u201cdoubtless she is in her bedroom.\u201d He rushed towards the door, found it bolted, and stopped, shuddering. \u201cH\u00e9lo\u00efse!\u201d he cried. He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed. \u201cH\u00e9lo\u00efse!\u201d he repeated. \u201cWho is there?\u201d answered the voice of her he sought. He thought that voice more feeble than usual. \u201cOpen the door!\u201d cried Villefort. \u201cOpen; it is I.\u201d But notwithstanding this request, notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered, the door remained closed. Villefort burst it open with a violent blow. At the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir, Madame de Villefort was standing erect, pale, her features contracted, and her eyes glaring horribly. \u201cH\u00e9lo\u00efse, H\u00e9lo\u00efse!\u201d he said, \u201cwhat is the matter?

Villefort ran to her and seized her hand, which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper. Madame de Villefort was dead. Villefort, maddened with horror, stepped back to the threshhold of the door, fixing his eyes on the corpse. \u201cMy son!\u201d he exclaimed suddenly, \u201cwhere is my son?\u2014Edward, Edward!\u201d and he rushed out of the room, still crying, \u201cEdward, Edward!\u201d The name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up."], "His vengeance complete, Monte Cristo arrives in Marseilles just in time to watch Albert board a ship bound for ___.": [" The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pom\u00e8gue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot. The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La R\u00e9serve basin. When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship\u2019s bulwarks. He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven\u2019s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.", " \u2018Come,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018we have done all in our power, and M. Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried to save the ship, let us now save ourselves. To the boats, my lads, as quick as you can.\u2019 Now,\u201d continued Penelon, \u201cyou see, M. Morrel, a sailor is attached to his ship, but still more to his life, so we did not wait to be told twice; the more so, that the ship was sinking under us, and seemed to say, \u2018Get along\u2014save yourselves.\u2019 We soon launched the boat, and all eight of us got into it. The captain descended last, or rather, he did not descend, he would not quit the vessel; so I took him round the waist, and threw him into the boat, and then I jumped after him. It was time, for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a man-of-war. Ten minutes after she pitched forward, then the other way, spun round and round, and then good-bye to the _Pharaon_. As for us, we were three days without anything to eat or drink, so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest, when we saw _La Gironde_; we made signals of distress, she perceived us, made for us, and took us all on board. There now, M. Morrel, that\u2019s the whole truth, on the honor of a sailor; is not it true, you fellows there?\u201d A general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said M. Morrel, \u201cI know there was no one in fault but destiny.", " \u201cIf you like,\u201d replied the latter.

Meanwhile, Danglars, stooping to Monte Cristo\u2019s ear, \u201cYour advice was excellent,\u201d said he; \u201cthere is a whole history connected with the names Fernand and Yanina.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d said Monte Cristo. \u201cYes, I will tell you all; but take away the young man; I cannot endure his presence.\u201d \u201cHe is going with me.

Then, turning towards Albert,\u2014\u201cIt is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern Greek, both of which Hayd\u00e9e speaks so fluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian, which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation.\u201d The count made a sign to Hayd\u00e9e to address his visitor."], "After Albert departs for his military post, where does Monte Cristo find Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s living?": [" Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he took no refreshment.

You are of so superior a mind, nothing escapes you.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d \u201cBecause, for instance, you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave, that M. de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house.\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s raised herself on her feverish arm. \u201cM. de Monte Cristo!\u201d she exclaimed; \u201cand how is he connected with the question you asked me?\u201d 40219m \u201cYou know, mother, M. de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental, and it is customary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies.\u201d \u201cDo you say M. de Monte Cristo is our enemy?\u201d replied Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, becoming paler than the sheet which covered her. \u201cWho told you so? Why, you are mad, Albert! M. de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness. M. de Monte Cristo saved your life; you yourself presented him to us. Oh, I entreat you, my son, if you had entertained such an idea, dispel it; and my counsel to you\u2014nay, my prayer\u2014is to retain his friendship.\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d replied the young man, \u201cyou have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man.\u201d \u201cI?\u201d said Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale, and again becoming paler than ever.", " \u201cYes, doubtless; and is it not that he may never do us any harm?\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s shuddered, and, fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze, \u201cYou speak strangely,\u201d said she to Albert, \u201cand you appear to have some singular prejudices. What has the count done? Three days since you were with him in Normandy; only three days since we looked on him as our best friend.\u201d An ironical smile passed over Albert\u2019s lips. Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all; but as she was prudent and strong-minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears. Albert was silent; an instant after, the countess resumed: \u201cYou came to inquire after my health; I will candidly acknowledge that I am not well. You should install yourself here, and cheer my solitude. I do not wish to be left alone.\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d said the young man, \u201cyou know how gladly I would obey your wish, but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d replied Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, sighing, \u201cgo, Albert; I will not make you a slave to your filial piety.\u201d Albert pretended he did not hear, bowed to his mother, and quitted her. Scarcely had he shut her door, when Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s called a confidential servant, and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he should go that evening, and to come and tell her immediately what he observed. Then she rang for her lady\u2019s maid, and, weak as she was, she dressed, in order to be ready for whatever might happen.", " Albert returned safely\u2014then the count was revenged. An indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect, not of a downy couch, but of a tomb. But as we have said, he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph. He easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father\u2019s honor; but when that was done, why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms? It was then, when the count could not see Albert, that he sent for his servant, who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him. Ten minutes afterwards, General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar, black pantaloons, and black gloves. He had apparently given previous orders, for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach-house ready for him. The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak, in which two swords were wrapped, and, shutting the door, he took his seat by the side of the coachman. The coachman stooped down for his orders. \u201cTo the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es,\u201d said the general; \u201cthe Count of Monte Cristo\u2019s. Hurry!\u201d The horses bounded beneath the whip; and in five minutes they stopped before the count\u2019s door. M. de Morcerf opened the door himself, and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered the open door with his servant."], "Who follows Danglars to Thompson and French, knowing that Danglars is about to withdraw a huge sum of money?": [" But here are your bonds; pay me differently;\u201d and he held the bonds towards Danglars, who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp. Suddenly he rallied, made a violent effort to restrain himself, and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance. 50109m \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said, \u201cyour receipt is money.\u201d \u201cOh dear, yes; and if you were at Rome, the house of Thomson & French would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done.\u201d \u201cPardon me, count, pardon me.\u201d \u201cThen I may keep this money?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Danglars, while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair. \u201cYes, keep it\u2014keep it.\u201d Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say, \u201cCome, reflect; if you repent there is still time.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Danglars, \u201cno, decidedly no; keep my signatures. But you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business; I intended this money for the charity fund, and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not pay them with these precise bonds. How absurd\u2014as if one crown were not as good as another. Excuse me;\u201d and he began to laugh loudly, but nervously. \u201cCertainly, I excuse you,\u201d said Monte Cristo graciously, \u201cand pocket them.\u201d And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book. \u201cBut,\u201d said Danglars, \u201cthere is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs?\u201d \u201cOh, a mere nothing,\u201d said Monte Cristo.", " But you must let me make my observations, or the Frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum.\u201d Peppino nodded, and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which Danglars and the attendant had gone out. At the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance. \u201cWell?\u201d asked Peppino of his friend. \u201cJoy, joy\u2014the sum is large!\u201d \u201cFive or six millions, is it not?\u201d \u201cYes, you know the amount.\u201d \u201cOn the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo?\u201d \u201cWhy, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?\u201d \u201cI told you we were informed beforehand.\u201d \u201cThen why do you apply to me?\u201d \u201cThat I may be sure I have the right man.\u201d \u201cYes, it is indeed he. Five millions\u2014a pretty sum, eh, Peppino?\u201d \u201cHush\u2014here is our man!\u201d The clerk seized his pen, and Peppino his beads; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened. Danglars looked radiant with joy; the banker accompanied him to the door. Peppino followed Danglars. According to the arrangements, the carriage was waiting at the door. The guide held the door open. Guides are useful people, who will turn their hands to anything. Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty. The _cicerone_ reclosed the door, and sprang up by the side of the coachman. Peppino mounted the seat behind. \u201cWill your excellency visit Saint Peter\u2019s?\u201d asked the _cicerone_.", " Debray?\u201d inquired Danglars, with an air of indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile, acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker\u2019s domestic life. \u201cYes, my lord,\u201d replied the servant, \u201cM. Debray is with madame.\u201d Danglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, \u201cM. Lucien Debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the Minister of the Interior. As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in France. Her maiden name was De Servi\u00e8res, and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne.\u201d \u201cI have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already met M. Lucien Debray.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed?\u201d said Danglars; \u201cand where was that?\u201d \u201cAt the house of M. de Morcerf.\u201d \u201cAh! you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?\u201d \u201cWe were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.\u201d \u201cTrue, true,\u201d cried Danglars. \u201cLet me see; have I not heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of his having had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from Italy.\u201d \u201cHer ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,\u201d said the servant, who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress. \u201cWith your permission,\u201d said Danglars, bowing, \u201cI will precede you, to show you the way.\u201d \u201cBy all means,\u201d replied Monte Cristo; \u201cI follow you.\u201d Chapter 47.", " \u201cOh, sir,\u201d said Danglars, after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him,\u2014\u201cthree letters of unlimited credit! I can be no longer mistrustful, but you must pardon me, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of astonishment.\u201d \u201cNay,\u201d answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, \u201c\u2019tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded. Then, you can let me have some money, can you not?\u201d \u201cWhatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied Monte Cristo, \u201csince we mutually understand each other\u2014for such I presume is the case?\u201d Danglars bowed assentingly. \u201cYou are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind?\u201d \u201cOh, my dear count,\u201d exclaimed Danglars, \u201cI never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you.\u201d \u201cNo, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that we have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cSix millions!\u201d gasped Danglars\u2014\u201cso be it.\u201d \u201cThen, if I should require more,\u201d continued Monte Cristo in a careless manner, \u201cwhy, of course, I should draw upon you; but my present intention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned."], "What is Luigi Vampa reading when the kidnapped Danglars is presented to him?": [" \u201c\u2018Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,\u2019 said the sentinel. \u201c\u2018What has he to say?\u2019 inquired the young man who was in command in the chief\u2019s absence. \u201c\u2018I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd\u2019s life,\u2019 was Vampa\u2019s reply. \u201c\u2018Ah, I understand,\u2019 said the lieutenant; \u2018and you seek admittance into our ranks?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Welcome!\u2019 cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa. \u201c\u2018Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And what may that be?\u2019 inquired the bandits with astonishment. \u201c\u2018I come to ask to be your captain,\u2019 said the young man. \u201cThe bandits shouted with laughter. \u201c\u2018And what have you done to aspire to this honor?\u2019 demanded the lieutenant. \u201c\u2018I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my betrothed.\u2019 \u201cAn hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto, deceased.\u201d 20129m \u201cWell, my dear Albert,\u201d said Franz, turning towards his friend; \u201cwhat think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?\u201d \u201cI say he is a myth,\u201d replied Albert, \u201cand never had an existence.\u201d \u201cAnd what may a myth be?\u201d inquired Pastrini. \u201cThe explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,\u201d replied Franz. \u201cAnd you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of Rome?\u201d \u201cAnd with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example.\u201d \u201cThen the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?\u201d \u201cWhy, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast.", " \u201cThe next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in high spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the previous evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so cheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion. \u201cLuigi took her arm beneath his own, and led her to the door of the grotto. Then he paused. The young girl, perceiving that there was something extraordinary, looked at him steadfastly. \u201c\u2018Teresa,\u2019 said Luigi, \u2018yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the count\u2019s daughter.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied Teresa with astonishment; \u2018but I was mad to utter such a wish.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And I replied, \u201cVery well, you shall have it.\u201d\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the young girl, whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by Luigi, \u2018but of course your reply was only to please me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,\u2019 said Luigi proudly. \u2018Go into the grotto and dress yourself.\u2019 \u201cAt these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto, lighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume.", " \u201cSuddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at Vampa. \u201c\u2018Not another step,\u2019 he said, \u2018or you are a dead man.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What, then,\u2019 said Vampa, raising his hand with a gesture of disdain, while Teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm, clung closely to him, \u2018do wolves rend each other?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Who are you?\u2019 inquired the sentinel. \u201c\u2018I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of the San-Felice farm.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What do you want?\u2019 \u201c\u2018I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at Rocca Bianca.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Follow me, then,\u2019 said the sentinel; \u2018or, as you know your way, go first.\u2019 \u201cVampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit, went before Teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop. The two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal. \u201c\u2018Good!\u2019 said the sentry, \u2018you may now go on.\u2019 \u201cLuigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top of a small mountain, which no doubt in former days had been a volcano\u2014an extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had deserted Alba to come and found the city of Rome. \u201cTeresa and Luigi reached the summit, and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits.", " \u201cTeresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into a dressing-room. \u201cLuigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road, and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him. \u201cLuigi was not mistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways, and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route, he begged Luigi to be his guide. \u201cLuigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep up with. In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross-roads. On arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an emperor, he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow. \u201c\u2018That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again mistake.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And here is your recompense,\u2019 said the traveller, offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money."], "After twelve days of paying Vampa exorbitant prices for his meals, how much money does Danglars have left?": [" On the fourth, he was no longer a man, but a living corpse. He had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals, and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell. Then he entreated Peppino, as he would a guardian angel, to give him food; he offered him 1,000 francs for a mouthful of bread. But Peppino did not answer. On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell. \u201cAre you not a Christian?\u201d he said, falling on his knees. \u201cDo you wish to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of Heaven, is a brother? Oh, my former friends, my former friends!\u201d he murmured, and fell with his face to the ground. Then rising in despair, he exclaimed, \u201cThe chief, the chief!\u201d \u201cHere I am,\u201d said Vampa, instantly appearing; \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d \u201cTake my last gold,\u201d muttered Danglars, holding out his pocket-book, \u201cand let me live here; I ask no more for liberty\u2014I only ask to live!\u201d \u201cThen you suffer a great deal?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, yes, cruelly!\u201d \u201cStill, there have been men who suffered more than you.\u201d \u201cI do not think so.\u201d \u201cYes; those who have died of hunger.\u201d Danglars thought of the old man whom, in his hours of delirium, he had seen groaning on his bed. He struck his forehead on the ground and groaned. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cthere have been some who have suffered more than I have, but then they must have been martyrs at least.\u201d \u201cDo you repent?\u201d asked a deep, solemn voice, which caused Danglars\u2019 hair to stand on end.", " But here are your bonds; pay me differently;\u201d and he held the bonds towards Danglars, who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp.

Danglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint. He shut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and returned to his apartments; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her half-fainting condition, she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream. Chapter 66. Matrimonial Projects The day following this scene, at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his _coup\u00e9_ did not appear. At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars ordered her carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a curtain, watched the departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two o\u2019clock she had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove to the Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From twelve to two o\u2019clock Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his dispatches, and becoming more and more sad every minute, heaping figure upon figure, and receiving, among other visits, one from Major Cavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as ever, presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before, to terminate his business with the banker.", " \u201cAnd he had five millions in your hands alone!

Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert\u2019s wish to be introduced to Hayd\u00e9e, and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Hayd\u00e9e\u2019s recital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf\u2019s father). Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father\u2019s name before Hayd\u00e9e? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father\u2019s enemies. Albert took Beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him. \u201cYou are right,\u201d said the latter; \u201cM. Danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair, and it is of M. de Monte Cristo that you must demand an explanation.\u201d Albert turned. \u201cSir,\u201d said he to Danglars, \u201cunderstand that I do not take a final leave of you; I must ascertain if your insinuations are just, and am going now to inquire of the Count of Monte Cristo.\u201d He bowed to the banker, and went out with Beauchamp, without appearing to notice Cavalcanti. Danglars accompanied him to the door, where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the Count of Morcerf.", " I, as a tender father\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended from you.\u201d \u201cWhom do you mean by they?\u201d \u201c_Ma foi_, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who wrote the letter; you received one, did you not?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cFrom whom?\u201d \u201cFrom a certain Abb\u00e9 Busoni.\u201d \u201cHave you any knowledge of him?\u201d \u201cNo, I have never seen him.\u201d \u201cWhat did he say in the letter?\u201d \u201cYou will promise not to betray me?\u201d \u201cRest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same.\u201d \u201cThen read for yourself;\u201d and the major gave a letter into the young man\u2019s hand. Andrea read in a low voice: \u201c\u2018You are poor; a miserable old age awaits you. Would you like to become rich, or at least independent? Set out immediately for Paris, and demand of the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, No. 30, the son whom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari, and who was taken from you at five years of age. This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti. In order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter, you will find enclosed an order for 2,400 francs, payable in Florence, at Signor Gozzi\u2019s; also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo, on whom I give you a draft of 48,000 francs. Remember to go to the count on the 26th May at seven o\u2019clock in the evening. \u201c(Signed) \u2018Abb\u00e9 Busoni.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt is the same.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said the major. \u201cI was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same effect.\u201d \u201cYou?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cFrom the Abb\u00e9 Busoni?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cFrom whom, then?\u201d \u201cFrom an Englishman, called Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of Sinbad the Sailor.\u201d \u201cAnd of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abb\u00e9 Busoni?\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken; there I am ahead of you.\u201d \u201cYou have seen him, then?\u201d \u201cYes, once.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cAh, that is just what I cannot tell you; if I did, I should make you as wise as myself, which it is not my intention to do.\u201d \u201cAnd what did the letter contain?\u201d \u201cRead it.\u201d \u201c\u2018You are poor, and your future prospects are dark and gloomy.", " She evidently interrogated him by her look. \u201cYes,\u201d said he. Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and swallowed it. \u201cAnd now, my dear child, adieu for the present. I will try and gain a little sleep, for you are saved.\u201d \u201cGo,\u201d said Valentine, \u201cwhatever happens, I promise you not to fear.\u201d Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who gradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her. Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had taken it, and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after throwing a farewell glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the Lord. Chapter 102. Valentine The night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water. The globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue, and the flame, brightening before it expired, threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies. A dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl. All noise in the streets had ceased, and the silence was frightful. It was then that the door of Edward\u2019s room opened, and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite; it was Madame de Villefort, who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared.", " Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm; then, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable terror, she awaited the event. Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine summoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep. \u201cValentine!\u201d said a low voice. The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply. \u201cValentine,\u201d repeated the same voice. Still silent: Valentine had promised not to wake. Then everything was still, excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she ventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw a woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass. During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept: it was Madame de Villefort. On recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder, which caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains, she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of Valentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo; she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife."], "According to Monte Cristo\u2019s final letter to Maximillian, all human wisdom is contained in which two words?": [" All that is in this grotto, my friend, my house in the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and my ch\u00e2teau at Tr\u00e9port, are the marriage gifts bestowed by Edmond Dant\u00e8s upon the son of his old master, Morrel. Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them with you; for I entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father, now a madman, and her brother who died last September with his mother. Tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny, Morrel, to pray sometimes for a man, who, like Satan, thought himself for an instant equal to God, but who now acknowledges with Christian humility that God alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom. Perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart. As for you, Morrel, this is the secret of my conduct towards you. There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living. \u201cLive, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words,\u2014\u2018_Wait and hope_.\u2019\u2014Your friend, \u201cEdmond Dant\u00e8s, _Count of Monte Cristo_.\u201d 50282m During the perusal of this letter, which informed Valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother, she became pale, a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom, and tears, not the less painful because they were silent, ran down her cheeks; her happiness cost her very dear.", " In addition to this, everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection. Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the daughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars to write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert\u2019s wish to be introduced to Hayd\u00e9e, and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of Ali, and had not opposed Hayd\u00e9e\u2019s recital (but having, doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to her, not to implicate Morcerf\u2019s father). Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father\u2019s name before Hayd\u00e9e? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father\u2019s enemies. Albert took Beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him. \u201cYou are right,\u201d said the latter; \u201cM.
