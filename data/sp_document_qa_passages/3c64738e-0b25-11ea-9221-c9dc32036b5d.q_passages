Alas, no, I know not. A woman, about six months after, came to claim it with the other half of the napkin. This woman gave all the requisite particulars, and it was intrusted to her.\u201d \u201cBut you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced her.\u201d \u201cAnd what do you think I did? I feigned a criminal process, and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her.

Besides, your own fortune, as your father assured me, is almost equal to that of your betrothed. But enough of money matters. Do you know, M.

The boat was built for speed; her two paddle-wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird. Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air, and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there. As the distance increased between the travellers and Paris, almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count; he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land. Ere long Marseilles presented herself to view,\u2014Marseilles, white, fervid, full of life and energy,\u2014Marseilles, the younger sister of Tyre and Carthage, the successor to them in the empire of the Mediterranean,\u2014Marseilles, old, yet always young.", " Villefort again groaned with anguish and despair. \u201cAh,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthat woman became criminal only from associating with me!

He stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case; it was the honor of M. de Morcerf, and that of the whole House, he proposed to defend, by provoking a debate on personal questions, which are always such painful themes of discussion. He concluded by calling for an investigation, which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread, and restore M. de Morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion. Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly.", " \u201cEnough, enough!\u201d replied Caderousse; \u201csay no more about it; I will take all the consequences upon myself.\u201d And he began his story.

Whole hours sometimes passed while Faria was giving instructions to Dant\u00e8s,\u2014instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,\u2014the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second opening. In the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably. Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who learns to make something from nothing.", " \u201cIt is for that reason I am delighted to see you,\u201d continued the abb\u00e9, \u201calthough you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which, if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton\u2019s system.

But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when Edmond returned to his cell. One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling him. He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name, reached him. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow.

Instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers, who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor, Dant\u00e8s carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.\u201d \u201cThen, I suppose,\u201d asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, \u201cthat it was a stone of immense value?\u201d \u201cWhy, everything is relative,\u201d answered the abb\u00e9. \u201cTo one in Edmond\u2019s position the diamond certainly was of great value.", " This poor fellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him.\u2019 \u201c\u2018But how did he obtain it?\u2019 asked the jeweller; \u2018had he it before he was imprisoned?\u2019 \u201c\u2018No, monsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich Englishman, and as in prison he fell sick, and Dant\u00e8s took the same care of him as if he had been his brother, the Englishman, when he was set free, gave this stone to Dant\u00e8s, who, less fortunate, died, and, in his turn, left it to us, and charged the excellent abb\u00e9, who was here this morning, to deliver it.\u2019 \u201c\u2018The same story,\u2019 muttered the jeweller; \u2018and improbable as it seemed at first, it may be true.

The unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne with the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by degrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from being naked, dirty, and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector\u2019s voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt his heart leap with joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or the doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the grating of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M.

Yes, indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you, young and with a promising future,\u2014now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.\u201d Edmond turned away his head with a sigh. \u201cYou persist in your incredulity, Edmond,\u201d continued Faria. \u201cMy words have not convinced you.

So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter, I philosophically closed my eyes; but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of another man\u2019s fortune. You were rich when I married you, but little respected. Excuse me for speaking so very candidly, but as this is intended only for ourselves, I do not see why I should weigh my words. I have augmented our fortune, and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen years, till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it,\u2014without any fault of mine, I can honestly declare. You, madame, have only sought to increase your own, and I am convinced that you have succeeded. I leave you, therefore, as I took you,\u2014rich, but little respected. Adieu! I also intend from this time to work on my own account.", " It was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act. But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed: \u201cOh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed.\u201d \u201cAh, yes, most assuredly,\u201d said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake. \u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d murmured she. The old man\u2019s declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and said: \u201cThen, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson, Edward de Villefort?\u201d The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible, and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred."], "Why does Dant\u00e8sgive Caderousse a valuable diamond?": [" It was estimated at fifty thousand francs.\u201d \u201cBless me!\u201d exclaimed Caderousse, \u201cfifty thousand francs!

I have it with me.\u201d The sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest\u2019s garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure. Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abb\u00e9 opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship. \u201cAnd that diamond,\u201d cried Caderousse, almost breathless with eager admiration, \u201cyou say, is worth fifty thousand francs?\u201d \u201cIt is, without the setting, which is also valuable,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9, as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.", " Caderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect. \u201cIt is a false diamond,\u201d said Caderousse. \u201cYou are joking now,\u201d replied Andrea. \u201cDo not be angry, we can try it.\u201d Caderousse went to the window, touched the glass with it, and found it would cut. \u201c_Confiteor!_\u201d said Caderousse, putting the diamond on his little finger; \u201cI was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller\u2019s shop\u2014it is another branch of industry paralyzed.\u201d \u201cHave you finished?\u201d said Andrea,\u2014\u201cdo you want anything more?\u2014will you have my waistcoat or my hat?

I only, as you see, have remained poor, wretched, and forgotten.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken, my friend,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9; \u201cGod may seem sometimes to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there always comes a moment when he remembers\u2014and behold\u2014a proof!\u201d As he spoke, the abb\u00e9 took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it to Caderousse, said, \u201cHere, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.\u201d \u201cWhat, for me only?\u201d cried Caderousse, \u201cah, sir, do not jest with me!\u201d \u201cThis diamond was to have been shared among his friends."], "When Dant\u00e8s savesMonsieur Morrel from ruin, how does he sign his letter?": [" \u201cI was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.\u201d \u201cHave you shown this letter to anyone?\u201d asked Villefort, becoming still more pale. \u201cTo no one, on my honor.\u201d \u201cEverybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the Island of Elba, and addressed to M.

But, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Viscount Albert de Morcerf, he had written in pencil: \u201c27, _Rue du Helder, on the_ 21_st May, half-past ten_ A.M.\u201d Chapter 39. The Guests In the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite another building, in which were the servants\u2019 apartments.", " \u201cBut still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,\u201d said the count, \u201cyou must allow that he has a fine name?\u201d \u201cSo he has; but I like mine as well.\u201d \u201cCertainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years.\u201d \u201cAnd for this very reason,\u201d said Danglars with a smile, which he tried to make sardonic, \u201cI prefer M.

Meanwhile the heat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices. Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he took no refreshment. Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo; she saw that he took nothing, and even noticed his gesture of refusal. \u201cAlbert,\u201d she asked, \u201cdid you notice that?\u201d \u201cWhat, mother?\u201d \u201cThat the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of M. de Morcerf.\u201d \u201cYes; but then he breakfasted with me\u2014indeed, he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion.\u201d \u201cBut your house is not M. de Morcerf\u2019s,\u201d murmured Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s; \u201cand since he has been here I have watched him.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cWell, he has taken nothing yet.\u201d \u201cThe count is very temperate.\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s smiled sadly.", " \u201cTo the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es,\u201d said the general; \u201cthe Count of Monte Cristo\u2019s.

M. de Morcerf opened the door himself, and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered the open door with his servant. A moment afterwards, Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte Cristo, and the latter, leading Hayd\u00e9e aside, ordered that Morcerf be asked into the drawing-room.

For example, supposing it were the daughter of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the father-in-law of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the major takes the key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling cards or rattling the dice.\u201d \u201cAh, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will want a crown, an El Dorado, and Potos\u00ed.\u201d \u201cNo; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry into plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race.

And the thing was so much the more annoying, as, according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman, Albert had quitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs. Alas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his way; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all faithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage over those of France, that they are faithful even in their infidelity.", " The Viscount of Morcerf can only wed a marchioness.\u201d \u201cBut two million francs make a nice little sum,\u201d replied Morcerf. \u201cIt is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a railroad from the Jardin des Plantes to La R\u00e2p\u00e9e.\u201d \u201cNever mind what he says, Morcerf,\u201d said Debray, \u201cdo you marry her.

Noirtier?\u201d \u201cThat is it,\u201d said the old man\u2019s eye. Then he looked anxiously at Valentine. \u201cDo you fear he will not understand?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOh, we have so often spoken of you, that he knows exactly how I talk to you.\u201d Then turning to Maximilian, with an adorable smile; although shaded by sorrow,\u2014\u201cHe knows everything I know,\u201d said she."], "How does Dant\u00e8slearn to feel normal human emotions again?": [" You know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage-contract.

Courted by my step-mother, who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by Edward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count\u2019s large black eyes, runs to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he is sure to find some delightful present,\u2014M. de Monte Cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family.\u201d \u201cIf such be the case, my dear Valentine, you must yourself have felt, or at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence.

Yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me, that I shall, on compulsion, consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness.

Besides, it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life.\u201d Thus Dant\u00e8s, who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough, and panted for wealth. The cause was not in Dant\u00e8s, but in Providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has filled him with boundless desires. Meanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn by a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never before trod, Dant\u00e8s approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed.

Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly. As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of position\u2014a superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman. Then in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond, with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor Abb\u00e9 Faria had been his tutor."], "What do Dant\u00e8s\u2019 friends conspire to accuse him of?": [" I assure you,\u201d cried Danglars, with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man, \u201cI solemnly declare to you, that I should never have thought of writing to Yanina, did I know anything of Ali Pasha\u2019s misfortunes.\u201d \u201cWho, then, urged you to write?

The galley-slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other. They were very happy. He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were it even the mad abb\u00e9. The jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently imagined that Dant\u00e8s wished to conspire or attempt an escape, and refused his request. Dant\u00e8s had exhausted all human resources, and he then turned to God. All the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new meaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven!", " It was a mistake.\u201d \u201cYes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a sleepless night, which has caused the minister\u2019s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.\u201d \u201cBut, sir,\u201d said Hermine suddenly, \u201cif all this is, as you say, caused by M.

Doubtless, although less evident, Monte Cristo\u2019s joy was not less intense. Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is outwardly apparent. Monte Cristo was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time dared to believe, that there were two Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s in the world, and he might yet be happy.

Debray,\u201d said the banker, \u201cdo not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as well tomorrow; but I claim tonight and will devote it, if you will allow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.\u201d This time the blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien and the baroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with their eyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband was victorious.", " M. Danglars appeared; Debray reseated himself. At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round, and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal. \u201cGood-evening, madame,\u201d said the banker; \u201cgood-evening, M. Debray.\u201d Probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming a dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her husband. \u201cRead me something, M. Debray,\u201d she said. Debray, who was slightly disturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl knife inlaid with gold. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said the banker, \u201cbut you will tire yourself, baroness, by such late hours, and M. Debray lives some distance from here.\u201d Debray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and politely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do."], "Caderousse illustrates that human happiness is attributable largely to ___.": [" I have dined many times with him and the Count of Morcerf, so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.\u201d \u201cCome, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.\u201d \u201cThat is all very fine, Benedetto mio, but I know what I am saying.

Noirtier\u2019s weakness of mind sufficiently explains it. It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry you that he is angry, but because she will marry, a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow. Old age is selfish, sir, and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M. Noirtier, which she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness d\u2019\u00c9pinay.

But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself, for he constantly hopes. During this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.

At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars ordered her carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a curtain, watched the departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders that he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two o\u2019clock she had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove to the Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From twelve to two o\u2019clock Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his dispatches, and becoming more and more sad every minute, heaping figure upon figure, and receiving, among other visits, one from Major Cavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as ever, presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before, to terminate his business with the banker."], "Before his imprisonment, what kind of man is Dant\u00e8s?": [" what has happened?\u201d \u201cQuick! quick!\u201d returned the abb\u00e9, \u201clisten to what I have to say.\u201d Dant\u00e8s looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria, whose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles, while his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair seemed to stand on end. \u201cTell me, I beseech you, what ails you?\u201d cried Dant\u00e8s, letting his chisel fall to the floor. \u201cAlas,\u201d faltered out the abb\u00e9, \u201call is over with me. I am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you what that is.

That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation. My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused. When he quitted me, he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence. \u201cI had speedy proofs that the excellent abb\u00e9 was engaged in my behalf, for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held.", " However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had repaired it completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dant\u00e8s had partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered, the abb\u00e9 had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a stronger, and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes. \u201cYou see,\u201d said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to Faria, \u201cthat God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you.

It was then that he encountered for the first time Villefort\u2019s look,\u2014that look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own. \u201cWho and what are you?\u201d demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour\u2019s time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt espionage of which \u201cthe accused\u201d is always made the victim. \u201cMy name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s,\u201d replied the young man calmly; \u201cI am mate of the _Pharaon_, belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.\u201d \u201cYour age?\u201d continued Villefort. \u201cNineteen,\u201d returned Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWhat were you doing at the moment you were arrested?\u201d \u201cI was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,\u201d said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.", " Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars.", " Dant\u00e8s turned pale, hesitated, and reflected. \u201cCome,\u201d said he to himself, \u201cbe a man. I am accustomed to adversity. I must not be cast down by the discovery that I have been deceived. What, then, would be the use of all I have suffered? The heart breaks when, after having been elated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions destroyed. Faria has dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he never came here, or if he did, C\u00e6sar Borgia, the intrepid adventurer, the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has followed him, discovered his traces, pursued them as I have done, raised the stone, and descending before me, has left me nothing.\u201d He remained motionless and pensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet. \u201cNow that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the slightest hopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity.\u201d And he remained again motionless and thoughtful."], "Dant\u00e8s\u2019 plunge into the sea after escaping from prison is symbolic of what religious ceremony?": [" Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s.

The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o\u2019clock. The sea continued to get calmer. \u201cIn two or three hours,\u201d thought Dant\u00e8s, \u201cthe turnkey will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I am cold, I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. Oh, my God, I have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what I am unable to do for myself.\u201d As Dant\u00e8s (his eyes turned in the direction of the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If) uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pom\u00e8gue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and with his sailor\u2019s eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan.", " Should Dant\u00e8s not return, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s might one day be his. 0165m Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in tears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times gazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her. Caderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married and eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dant\u00e8s, who was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon\u2019s downfall. Five months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the hour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s\u2019 arms.", " \u201cThe treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,\u2014I ask no more.\u201d The governor laughed. \u201cIs the spot far from here?\u201d \u201cA hundred leagues.\u201d \u201cIt is not ill-planned,\u201d said the governor. \u201cIf all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of escaping.\u201d \u201cThe scheme is well known,\u201d said the inspector; \u201cand the abb\u00e9\u2019s plan has not even the merit of originality.\u201d Then turning to Faria, \u201cI inquired if you are well fed?\u201d said he. \u201cSwear to me,\u201d replied Faria, \u201cto free me if what I tell you prove true, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.\u201d \u201cAre you well fed?\u201d repeated the inspector. \u201cMonsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so there is no chance of my escaping.\u201d \u201cYou do not reply to my question,\u201d replied the inspector impatiently."], "Which political party of the era do all the novel\u2019s sympathetic characters have a connection with?": [" The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling. The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls,\u2014after having been accustomed to hear the \u201c_Vive Napol\u00e9ons_\u201d of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,\u2014was looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne. The magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while the women commented on the divorce of Josephine.", " I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dant\u00e8s, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.\u201d Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dant\u00e8s, who this time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust: \u201cThis 25th day of April, 1498, be... Alexander VI., and fearing that not... he may desire to become my heir, and re... and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,... my sole heir, that I have bu... and has visited with me, that is, in...

When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dant\u00e8s. 0099m \u201cGo on, sir,\u201d said he. \u201cWhat would you have me say?\u201d \u201cGive all the information in your power.\u201d \u201cTell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only,\u201d added he, with a smile, \u201cI warn you I know very little.\u201d \u201cHave you served under the usurper?\u201d \u201cI was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.\u201d \u201cIt is reported your political opinions are extreme,\u201d said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.", " But this time the papers were a mere matter of form. Villefort had secluded himself, not to study, but to reflect; and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business, he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events, the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections. Then, instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him, he opened the drawer of his desk, touched a spring, and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda, amongst which he had carefully arranged, in characters only known to himself, the names of all those who, either in his political career, in money matters, at the bar, or in his mysterious love affairs, had become his enemies. Their number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet these names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the almost impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has so perilously climbed."], "Which of the following is symbolic of the connection between good deeds and reward?": [" \u201cYes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel; he has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he has, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose, all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an end.\u201d \u201cHorrible!\u201d ejaculated the priest. \u201cAnd it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,\u201d added Caderousse. \u201cYou see, I, who never did a bad action but that I have told you of\u2014am in destitution, with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes, and I unable to do anything in the world for her; I shall die of hunger, as old Dant\u00e8s did, while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth.\u201d \u201cHow is that?\u201d \u201cBecause their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest men have been reduced to misery.\u201d \u201cWhat has become of Danglars, the instigator, and therefore the most guilty?\u201d \u201cWhat has become of him?", " \u201cWhy, what good would it do?\u201d asked Caderousse. \u201cIf the poor lad were living, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should not hesitate. But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with him.\u201d \u201cYou prefer, then,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, \u201cthat I should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful friendship?\u201d \u201cThat is true enough,\u201d returned Caderousse. \u201cYou say truly, the gift of poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars; besides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of water in the ocean.\u201d \u201cRemember,\u201d chimed in La Carconte, \u201cthose two could crush you at a single blow!\u201d \u201cHow so?\u201d inquired the abb\u00e9. \u201cAre these persons, then, so rich and powerful?\u201d \u201cDo you not know their history?\u201d \u201cI do not.", " \u201cOh, sir\u201d\u2014said she, clasping her hands. \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said the stranger, \u201cone day you will receive a letter signed \u2018Sinbad the Sailor.\u2019 Do exactly what the letter bids you, however strange it may appear.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d returned Julie. \u201cDo you promise?\u201d \u201cI swear to you I will.\u201d \u201cIt is well. Adieu, mademoiselle. Continue to be the good, sweet girl you are at present, and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward you by giving you Emmanuel for a husband.\u201d Julie uttered a faint cry, blushed like a rose, and leaned against the baluster. The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend. In the court he found Penelon, who, with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand, seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them. \u201cCome with me, my friend,\u201d said the Englishman; \u201cI wish to speak to you.\u201d Chapter 30. The Fifth of September The extension provided for by the agent of Thomson & French, at the moment when Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him.", " \u201cNow,\u201d continued Faria, addressing Dant\u00e8s with an almost paternal expression, \u201cnow, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d inquired Dant\u00e8s hesitating, \u201chas this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?\u201d \u201cNo, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.\u201d \u201cAnd you say this treasure amounts to\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cTwo millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.\u201d2 \u201cImpossible!\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, staggered at the enormous amount. \u201cImpossible? and why?\u201d asked the old man. \u201cThe Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.\u201d Edmond thought he was in a dream\u2014he wavered between incredulity and joy."], "Which of the following is symbolic of Dant\u00e8s\u2019 power (and human limitations)?": [" At this moment hope makes me despise their riches, which seem to me contemptible. Yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me, that I shall, on compulsion, consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness. Oh, no!\u201d exclaimed Edmond, \u201cthat will not be. The wise, unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one thing. Besides, it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life.\u201d Thus Dant\u00e8s, who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough, and panted for wealth. The cause was not in Dant\u00e8s, but in Providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has filled him with boundless desires. Meanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn by a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never before trod, Dant\u00e8s approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest object with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain rocks, marks made by the hand of man.", " I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.\u201d The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust. Dant\u00e8s examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels. \u201cAs for the ink,\u201d said Faria, \u201cI told you how I managed to obtain that\u2014and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.\u201d \u201cOne thing still puzzles me,\u201d observed Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand that is how you managed to do all this by daylight?\u201d \u201cI worked at night also,\u201d replied Faria. \u201cNight!\u2014why, for Heaven\u2019s sake, are your eyes like cats\u2019, that you can see to work in the dark?\u201d \u201cIndeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions.", " \u201cNow,\u201d continued Faria, addressing Dant\u00e8s with an almost paternal expression, \u201cnow, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d inquired Dant\u00e8s hesitating, \u201chas this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?\u201d \u201cNo, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct.

That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation. My voluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that of which I stood accused. When he quitted me, he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence. \u201cI had speedy proofs that the excellent abb\u00e9 was engaged in my behalf, for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held."], "What is Edmond Dant\u00e8s\u2019 position on the ship Pharaon, which arrives at Marseilles in the first chapter?": [" The Burglary Chapter 83.

The Fifth of October VOLUME ONE Chapter 1. Marseilles\u2014The Arrival On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.

Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the _Pharaon_, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city. The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pom\u00e8gue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board.", " Alone!\u2014never again to see the face, never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth!

The sailors looked at one another. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked the captain. \u201cA prisoner has escaped from the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If, and they are firing the alarm gun,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s.", " The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness. \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said Albert with affectionate courtesy, \u201cthe count of Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me; you are his friend, be ours also.\u201d \u201cWell said,\u201d interrupted Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud; \u201cand pray that, if you should ever be in a similar predicament, he may do as much for you as he did for me.\u201d \u201cWhat has he done?\u201d asked Albert. \u201cOh, nothing worth speaking of,\u201d said Morrel; \u201cM. de Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud exaggerates.\u201d \u201cNot worth speaking of?\u201d cried Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud; \u201clife is not worth speaking of!\u2014that is rather too philosophical, on my word, Morrel.

But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these details?\u201d \u201cSire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this mission was to prepare men\u2019s minds for a return (it is the man who says this, sire)\u2014a return which will soon occur.\u201d \u201cAnd where is this man?\u201d \u201cIn prison, sire.\u201d \u201cAnd the matter seems serious to you?\u201d \u201cSo serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your majesty\u2019s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my devotion.\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d said Louis XVIII., \u201cwas there not a marriage engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-M\u00e9ran?\u201d \u201cDaughter of one of your majesty\u2019s most faithful servants.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.\u201d \u201cSire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.\u201d \u201cA conspiracy in these times,\u201d said Louis XVIII., smiling, \u201cis a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future.", " \u201cFor a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the executioner.\u201d \u201cHow dreadful!\u201d exclaimed Ren\u00e9e, turning pale. \u201cIs it possible?\u201d burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words. \u201cWhy, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered.\u201d \u201cCan I believe my ears?\u201d cried the marquise. \u201cI will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,\u201d said Villefort: \u201c\u2018The king\u2019s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dant\u00e8s, mate of the ship _Pharaon_, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dant\u00e8s, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father\u2019s abode.", " \u201cEverything points to the conclusion, sire,\u201d said the minister of police, \u201cthat death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been with him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general\u2019s valet, who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street mentioned, but did not catch the number.\u201d As the police minister related this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker\u2019s lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king looked towards him. \u201cDo you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?\u201d \u201cIt is probable, sire,\u201d replied Villefort.", " What has happened is quite natural, and in conformity with the law of reprisals.\u2019 \u201c\u2018What,\u2019 cried I, \u2018do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?\u2019 \u201c\u2018All these Corsicans are mad, on my honor,\u2019 replied M. de Villefort; \u2018they fancy that their countryman is still emperor. You have mistaken the time, you should have told me this two months ago, it is too late now. Go now, at once, or I shall have you put out.\u2019 \u201cI looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty. But he was a man of stone. I approached him, and said in a low voice, \u2018Well, since you know the Corsicans so well, you know that they always keep their word. You think that it was a good deed to kill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist. Well, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is, that I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta against you, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet your last hour has come.\u2019 And before he had recovered from his surprise, I opened the door and left the room.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201csuch an innocent looking person as you are to do those things, M.

Danglars is his banker, is he not?\u201d asked Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud of Debray. \u201cI believe so,\u201d replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. \u201cBut Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel.\u201d \u201cMorrel?

But hush, here comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin,\u201d and the three young men drew near to listen. Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e d\u2019Antin, to M. Danglars\u2019. The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard, and advanced to meet him with a sad, though affable smile.", " I always knew you were a good son.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d inquired Dant\u00e8s, with some hesitation, \u201cdo you know how my father is?\u201d \u201cWell, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.\u201d \u201cYes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.\u201d \u201cThat proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.\u201d Dant\u00e8s smiled. \u201cMy father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.\u201d \u201cWell, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.\u201d \u201cI must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.\u201d \u201cTrue, Dant\u00e8s, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father\u2014the lovely Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.\u201d Dant\u00e8s blushed. \u201cAh, ha,\u201d said the shipowner, \u201cI am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the _Pharaon_.", " He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere, and then went on. At the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle. But to Dant\u00e8s\u2019 eye there was no darkness. He glanced around this second grotto; it was, like the first, empty. The treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had at length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dant\u00e8s\u2019 fate would be decided. He advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his resolution, attacked the ground with the pickaxe. At the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance. Never did funeral knell, never did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer. Had Dant\u00e8s found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale. He again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same resistance, but not the same sound. \u201cIt is a casket of wood bound with iron,\u201d thought he. At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening; Dant\u00e8s seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted the stair."], "What does Dant\u00e8s use to scrape through the wall of the prison to reach his neighbor?": [" Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say there is no need why Dant\u00e8s should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he should. Dant\u00e8s is a good fellow; I like Dant\u00e8s. Dant\u00e8s, your health.\u201d Fernand rose impatiently. \u201cLet him run on,\u201d said Danglars, restraining the young man; \u201cdrunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says. Absence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were between Edmond and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone.\u201d 0056m \u201cYes; but one gets out of prison,\u201d said Caderousse, who, with what sense was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \u201cand when one gets out and one\u2019s name is Edmond Dant\u00e8s, one seeks revenge\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat matters that?\u201d muttered Fernand. \u201cAnd why, I should like to know,\u201d persisted Caderousse, \u201cshould they put Dant\u00e8s in prison? he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said Danglars.", " He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was a greater reason for proceeding\u2014if his neighbor would not come to him, he would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer\u2019s visit arrived, Dant\u00e8s straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and placed it in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of soup into it, together with the fish\u2014for thrice a week the prisoners were deprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time, had not Dant\u00e8s long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the turnkey retired. Dant\u00e8s wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work.", " \u201cBut, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time, so he\u2019s welcome.\u201d As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining. \u201cWhat, is it you, Edmond, back again?\u201d said he, with a broad Marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth. \u201cYes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s, but ill-concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility. \u201cThanks\u2014thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me.\u201d Dant\u00e8s made a gesture. \u201cI do not allude to you, my boy. No!\u2014no! I lent you money, and you returned it; that\u2019s like good neighbors, and we are quits.\u201d \u201cWe are never quits with those who oblige us,\u201d was Dant\u00e8s\u2019 reply; \u201cfor when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of mentioning that?", " Dant\u00e8s was on his bed. It seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, \u201cCome, are you going mad again?\u201d Dant\u00e8s did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; Dant\u00e8s hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but he was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed from the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees. \u201cIs it you?\u201d said he; \u201cI am here.\u201d \u201cIs your jailer gone?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s; \u201che will not return until the evening; so that we have twelve hours before us.\u201d \u201cI can work, then?\u201d said the voice. \u201cOh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.\u201d In a moment that part of the floor on which Dant\u00e8s was resting his two hands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he drew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed."], "What is the political cause for which Abb\u00e9 Faria has been jailed?": [" During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands, tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria? Dant\u00e8s remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his friend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced, once for all, that the abb\u00e9 was mad\u2014such a conviction would be so terrible! But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his leg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm.", " \u201cIt is for that reason I am delighted to see you,\u201d continued the abb\u00e9, \u201calthough you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which, if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton\u2019s system. Could you allow me a few words in private.\u201d \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d said the governor. \u201cYou knew him,\u201d returned the inspector with a smile. \u201cWhat you ask is impossible, monsieur,\u201d continued he, addressing Faria. 0175m \u201cBut,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, \u201cI would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to five millions.\u201d \u201cThe very sum you named,\u201d whispered the inspector in his turn. \u201cHowever,\u201d continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was about to depart, \u201cit is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone; the governor can be present.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said the governor, \u201cI know beforehand what you are about to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?\u201d Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity.", " He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he inquired. \u201cLook at it,\u201d said the abb\u00e9 with a smile. \u201cI have looked at it with all possible attention,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.\u201d \u201cThis paper, my friend,\u201d said Faria, \u201cI may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity\u2014this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.\u201d The sweat started forth on Dant\u00e8s\u2019 brow. Until this day and for how long a time!\u2014he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abb\u00e9 the accusation of madness. With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation.", " \u201cNor you to mine,\u201d cried the abb\u00e9. \u201cYou will not accept my gold; I will keep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.\u201d And the abb\u00e9, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued his calculations. 0177m \u201cWhat is he doing there?\u201d said the inspector. \u201cCounting his treasures,\u201d replied the governor. Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They went out. The turnkey closed the door behind them. \u201cHe was wealthy once, perhaps?\u201d said the inspector. \u201cOr dreamed he was, and awoke mad.\u201d \u201cAfter all,\u201d said the inspector, \u201cif he had been rich, he would not have been here.\u201d So the matter ended for the Abb\u00e9 Faria. He remained in his cell, and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity. Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for."], "What happens to thwart Abb\u00e9 Faria\u2019s and Dant\u00e8s\u2019 first escape plan?": [" The abb\u00e9 did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dant\u00e8s knew it, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dant\u00e8s drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dant\u00e8s advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But Dant\u00e8s was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased Edmond\u2019s admiration of him; but at the same time Dant\u00e8s could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.", " \u201cAnd will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last resort?\u201d \u201cI promise on my honor.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, \u201cwe may hope to put our design into execution.\u201d \u201cAnd how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?\u201d \u201cAt least a year.\u201d \u201cAnd shall we begin at once?\u201d \u201cAt once.\u201d \u201cWe have lost a year to no purpose!\u201d cried Dant\u00e8s. \u201cDo you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?\u201d asked the abb\u00e9. \u201cForgive me!\u201d cried Edmond, blushing deeply. \u201cTut, tut!\u201d answered the abb\u00e9, \u201cman is but man after all, and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me show you my plan.\u201d The abb\u00e9 then showed Dant\u00e8s the sketch he had made for their escape. It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of Dant\u00e8s, with the passage which united them. In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dant\u00e8s before he had power to offer any resistance.", " \u201cOh dear, yes, sir; the abb\u00e9\u2019s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of Bonaparte\u2019s emissaries,\u2014one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815, a very resolute and very dangerous man.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d said the Englishman. \u201cYes,\u201d replied M. de Boville; \u201cI myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers. That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget his countenance!\u201d 20025m The Englishman smiled imperceptibly. \u201cAnd you say, sir,\u201d he interposed, \u201cthat the two dungeons\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWere separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this Edmond Dant\u00e8s\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cThis dangerous man\u2019s name was\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cEdmond Dant\u00e8s. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dant\u00e8s had procured tools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another.\u201d \u201cThis tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?\u201d \u201cNo doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abb\u00e9 Faria had an attack of catalepsy, and died.\u201d \u201cThat must have cut short the projects of escape.\u201d \u201cFor the dead man, yes,\u201d replied M. de Boville, \u201cbut not for the survivor; on the contrary, this Dant\u00e8s saw a means of accelerating his escape.", " Faria had now fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed. \u201cI did not expect to see you again,\u201d said he feebly, to Dant\u00e8s. \u201cAnd why not?\u201d asked the young man. \u201cDid you fancy yourself dying?\u201d \u201cNo, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I thought you might have made your escape.\u201d The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWithout you? Did you really think me capable of that?\u201d \u201cAt least,\u201d said the abb\u00e9, \u201cI now see how wrong such an opinion would have been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack.\u201d \u201cBe of good cheer,\u201d replied Dant\u00e8s; \u201cyour strength will return.\u201d And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria, and took his hands. The abb\u00e9 shook his head. \u201cThe last attack I had,\u201d said he, \u201clasted but half an hour, and after it I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my right arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain."], "According to Abb\u00e9 Faria, from whom did Caesar Spada hide his family\u2019s treasure?": [" \u201cNow,\u201d continued Faria, addressing Dant\u00e8s with an almost paternal expression, \u201cnow, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d inquired Dant\u00e8s hesitating, \u201chas this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?\u201d \u201cNo, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse.\u201d \u201cAnd you say this treasure amounts to\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cTwo millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money.\u201d2 \u201cImpossible!\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, staggered at the enormous amount. \u201cImpossible? and why?\u201d asked the old man. \u201cThe Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch.\u201d Edmond thought he was in a dream\u2014he wavered between incredulity and joy.", " He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant did not find him. \u201cSpada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, \u2018C\u00e6sar wills that you die.\u2019 but it was a legate _\u00e0 latere_, who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope, \u2018His holiness requests you to dine with him.\u2019 \u201cSpada set out about two o\u2019clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew, in full costume, and C\u00e6sar Borgia paying him most marked attentions. Spada turned pale, as C\u00e6sar looked at him with an ironical air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well spread. \u201cThey began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message.", " He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dant\u00e8s. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he inquired. \u201cLook at it,\u201d said the abb\u00e9 with a smile. \u201cI have looked at it with all possible attention,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, \u201cand I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.\u201d \u201cThis paper, my friend,\u201d said Faria, \u201cI may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity\u2014this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you.\u201d The sweat started forth on Dant\u00e8s\u2019 brow. Until this day and for how long a time!\u2014he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abb\u00e9 the accusation of madness. With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation.", " Yet I had read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal C\u00e6sar Spada; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion in misfortune. \u201cI was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty. \u201cMy patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary."], "When Dant\u00e8s hides in Faria\u2019s burial shroud, what is attached around his legs before he is thrown into the sea?": [" He then bent his body, and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs, at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled. With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea, while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud. Dant\u00e8s waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid being seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, sombre and terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures.", " The abb\u00e9 did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dant\u00e8s knew it, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This island was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a rock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dant\u00e8s drew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dant\u00e8s advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure. But Dant\u00e8s was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a question now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased Edmond\u2019s admiration of him; but at the same time Dant\u00e8s could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.", " He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and land. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o\u2019clock. The sea continued to get calmer. \u201cIn two or three hours,\u201d thought Dant\u00e8s, \u201cthe turnkey will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I am cold, I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. Oh, my God, I have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what I am unable to do for myself.\u201d As Dant\u00e8s (his eyes turned in the direction of the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If) uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pom\u00e8gue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and with his sailor\u2019s eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan.", " He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.\u201d \u201cIt was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,\u201d remarked the Englishman. \u201cAs I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and, fortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account.\u201d \u201cHow was that?\u201d \u201cHow? Do you not comprehend?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThe Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into the sea, after fastening a thirty-six-pound cannon-ball to their feet.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension. \u201cWell, they fastened a thirty-six-pound ball to his feet, and threw him into the sea.\u201d \u201cReally!\u201d exclaimed the Englishman. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d continued the inspector of prisons."], "After Dant\u00e8s escapes, what excuse does he make to the Genoese sailors for why his hair/beard are so long?": [" You have saved my life, and I thank you,\u201d continued Dant\u00e8s. \u201cI was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair.\u201d \u201cIt was I,\u201d said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; \u201cand it was time, for you were sinking.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d returned Dant\u00e8s, holding out his hand, \u201cI thank you again.\u201d \u201cI almost hesitated, though,\u201d replied the sailor; \u201cyou looked more like a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair a foot long.\u201d Dant\u00e8s recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If. \u201cYes,\u201d said he, \u201cI made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but today the vow expires.\u201d \u201cNow what are we to do with you?\u201d said the captain. \u201cAlas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely escaped; but I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be sure to find employment.\u201d \u201cDo you know the Mediterranean?\u201d \u201cI have sailed over it since my childhood.\u201d \u201cYou know the best harbors?\u201d \u201cThere are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes.\u201d \u201cI say, captain,\u201d said the sailor who had cried \u201cCourage!\u201d to Dant\u00e8s, \u201cif what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?\u201d \u201cIf he says true,\u201d said the captain doubtingly.", " Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe. In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian\u2019s portraits.", " The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_ having expired, Dant\u00e8s took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him further. The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions from Dant\u00e8s to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo. Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dant\u00e8s proceeded to make his final adieus on board _La Jeune Am\u00e9lie_, distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all, and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans. Then Dant\u00e8s departed for Genoa. At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs.", " At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work. When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a looking-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance. Dant\u00e8s had entered the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself."], "Who offers to stay behind with Dant\u00e8s on the Island of Monte Cristo, impressing Dant\u00e8s with his selflessness?": [" The abb\u00e9 did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dant\u00e8s knew it, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there.

When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security, and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly. Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral island by the following day. 0289m Chapter 23.

Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present, which Dant\u00e8s hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of Dant\u00e8s gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy.", " Fortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly. As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of position\u2014a superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman. Then in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond, with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor Abb\u00e9 Faria had been his tutor.", " \u201cBravo!\u201d repeated the sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing. \u201cYou see,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, quitting the helm, \u201cI shall be of some use to you, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get, for my food and the clothes you lend me.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said the captain, \u201cwe can agree very well, if you are reasonable.\u201d \u201cGive me what you give the others, and it will be all right,\u201d returned Dant\u00e8s. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d said the seaman who had saved Dant\u00e8s; \u201cfor you know more than we do.\u201d \u201cWhat is that to you, Jacopo?\u201d returned the Captain. \u201cEveryone is free to ask what he pleases.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d replied Jacopo; \u201cI only make a remark.\u201d \u201cWell, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers, if you have them.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Jacopo; \u201cbut I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.\u201d \u201cThat is all I want,\u201d interrupted Dant\u00e8s.", " However, Jacopo insisted on following him, and Dant\u00e8s did not oppose this, fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust. Scarcely, however, had they gone a quarter of a league when, having killed a kid, he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades, and request them to cook it, and when ready to let him know by firing a gun. This and some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano, was the bill of fare. Dant\u00e8s went on, looking from time to time behind and around about him. Having reached the summit of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath him, his companions, whom Jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy preparing the repast which Edmond\u2019s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish. Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows. \u201cIn two hours\u2019 time,\u201d said he, \u201cthese persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each, to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs, and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs."], "What does Dant\u00e8s disguise himself as when he goes to see Caderousse at the Inn of Pont du Gard?": [" Chapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn Such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of Beaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,\u2014a little nearer to the former than to the latter,\u2014a small roadside inn, from the front of which hung, creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This modern place of entertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed upon the Rh\u00f4ne. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden, consisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy olives and stunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict. Between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots; while, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and displayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.", " \u201cI had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of beseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on that morning. \u201cIf Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and there existed no such person as the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, then, indeed, I was lost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth. \u201cTwo months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person I declared could exculpate me if he would.", " Andrea\u2019s hand left his pocket inoffensively, and was carried up to the red moustache, which it played with for some time. \u201cGood Caderousse,\u201d he said, \u201chow happy you will be.\u201d \u201cI will do my best,\u201d said the innkeeper of the Pont du Gard, shutting up his knife. \u201cWell, then, we will go into Paris. But how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion? It seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d said Caderousse, \u201cwe shall see.\u201d He then took the greatcoat with the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury, and put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcanti\u2019s hat, which he placed upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself. \u201cBut, tell me,\u201d said Andrea, \u201cam I to remain bareheaded?\u201d \u201cPooh,\u201d said Caderousse; \u201cit is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off.\u201d \u201cCome, come; enough of this,\u201d said Cavalcanti.", " And then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?

But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself, for he constantly hopes. During this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have done so when he parted from Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.

One evening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads leading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home more depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her. \u201cIt was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her. \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s seized Fernand\u2019s hands with a transport which he took for love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow.", " So call me Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, if you please.\u201d \u201cWe must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, \u201che is so easily mistaken.\u201d \u201cSo, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M.

Come, and I will explain to you.\u201d And with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian followed him, trembling as he went. Morrel opened the door, and closed it behind his son; then, crossing the anteroom, went to his desk on which he placed the pistols, and pointed with his finger to an open ledger. In this ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his affairs. Morrel had to pay, within half an hour, 287,500 francs. All he possessed was 15,257 francs. \u201cRead!\u201d said Morrel.

But, contrary to all expectation, when the 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual precision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M.

In the evening, Julie told her mother, that although he was apparently so calm, she had noticed that her father\u2019s heart beat violently.", " \u201cAre you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?\u201d inquired the man, with a strong Italian accent. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Julie with hesitation; \u201cwhat is your pleasure? I do not know you.\u201d \u201cRead this letter,\u201d he said, handing it to her. Julie hesitated. \u201cIt concerns the best interests of your father,\u201d said the messenger. The young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly and read: \u201cGo this moment to the All\u00e9es de Meilhan, enter the house No. 15, ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should receive it before eleven o\u2019clock. You promised to obey me implicitly. Remember your oath. \u201cSinbad the Sailor.\u201d The young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to question the messenger, but he had disappeared. She cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time, and saw there was a postscript.", " During the night, between the 4th and 5th of September, Madame Morrel remained listening for every sound, and, until three o\u2019clock in the morning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation. It was three o\u2019clock when he threw himself on the bed. The mother and daughter passed the night together. They had expected Maximilian since the previous evening. At eight o\u2019clock in the morning Morrel entered their chamber. He was calm; but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage. They did not dare to ask him how he had slept. Morrel was kinder to his wife, more affectionate to his daughter, than he had ever been. He could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl. Julie, mindful of Emmanuel\u2019s request, was following her father when he quitted the room, but he said to her quickly: \u201cRemain with your mother, dearest.\u201d Julie wished to accompany him. \u201cI wish you to do so,\u201d said he."], "In addition to his paid debt notes, what does Morrel\u2019s daughter find in the red silk purse?": [" Edmond had one friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.\u201d 0351m \u201cOh, sir,\u201d said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,\u2014\u201cOh, sir, do not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.\u201d \u201cI know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of such feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange\u2014\u2014\u201d Caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand. The abb\u00e9 smiled. \u201cIn exchange,\u201d he continued, \u201cgive me the red silk purse that M. Morrel left on old Dant\u00e8s\u2019 chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in your hands.\u201d Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abb\u00e9 a long purse of faded red silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt.", " At this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow, a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart-strings. He heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges\u2014the clock gave its warning to strike eleven\u2014the door of his study opened. Morrel did not turn round\u2014he expected these words of Cocles, \u201cThe agent of Thomson & French.\u201d He placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth. Suddenly he heard a cry\u2014it was his daughter\u2019s voice. He turned and saw Julie. The pistol fell from his hands. \u201cMy father!\u201d cried the young girl, out of breath, and half dead with joy\u2014\u201csaved, you are saved!\u201d And she threw herself into his arms, holding in her extended hand a red, netted silk purse. 20061m \u201cSaved, my child!\u201d said Morrel; \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cYes, saved\u2014saved! See, see!\u201d said the young girl. Morrel took the purse, and started as he did so, for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself.", " At one end was the receipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of parchment: _Julie\u2019s Dowry_. Morrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream. At this moment the clock struck eleven. He felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart. \u201cExplain, my child,\u201d he said, \u201cExplain, my child,\u201d he said, \u201cexplain\u2014where did you find this purse?\u201d \u201cIn a house in the All\u00e9es de Meilhan, No. 15, on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d cried Morrel, \u201cthis purse is not yours!\u201d Julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning. \u201cAnd did you go alone?\u201d asked Morrel, after he had read it. \u201cEmmanuel accompanied me, father. He was to have waited for me at the corner of the Rue du Mus\u00e9e, but, strange to say, he was not there when I returned.\u201d \u201cMonsieur Morrel!\u201d exclaimed a voice on the stairs; \u201cMonsieur Morrel!\u201d \u201cIt is his voice!\u201d said Julie.", " I have the purse still by me\u2014a large one, made of red silk.\u201d \u201cAnd,\u201d asked the abb\u00e9, \u201cis M. Morrel still alive?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Caderousse. \u201cIn that case,\u201d replied the abb\u00e9, \u201che should be a man blessed of God, rich, happy.\u201d Caderousse smiled bitterly. \u201cYes, happy as myself,\u201d said he. \u201cWhat! M. Morrel unhappy?\u201d exclaimed the abb\u00e9. \u201cHe is reduced almost to the last extremity\u2014nay, he is almost at the point of dishonor.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d continued Caderousse, \u201cso it is; after five-and-twenty years of labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of Marseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two years, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his only hope now is in that very _Pharaon_ which poor Dant\u00e8s commanded, and which is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo. If this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.\u201d \u201cAnd has the unfortunate man wife or children?\u201d inquired the abb\u00e9."], "What is the original purpose of Baron Franz d\u2019Epinay\u2019s initial visit to the island of Monte Cristo?": [" Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that red partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper. \u201cAh, if your excellency chose,\u201d said the captain, \u201cyou might have capital sport.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cDo you see that island?\u201d continued the captain, pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo sea. \u201cWell, what is this island?\u201d \u201cThe Island of Monte Cristo.\u201d \u201cBut I have no permission to shoot over this island.\u201d \u201cYour excellency does not require a permit, for the island is uninhabited.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed!\u201d said the young man. \u201cA desert island in the midst of the Mediterranean must be a curiosity.\u201d \u201cIt is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.\u201d \u201cTo whom does this island belong?\u201d \u201cTo Tuscany.\u201d \u201cWhat game shall I find there!\u201d \u201cThousands of wild goats.\u201d \u201cWho live upon the stones, I suppose,\u201d said Franz with an incredulous smile.", " At the mention of Monte Cristo Dant\u00e8s started with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a _lingua franca_. When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security, and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly. Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral island by the following day. 0289m Chapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo Thus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny, Dant\u00e8s was about to secure the opportunity he wished for, by simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring any suspicion.", " \u201cMademoiselle, mademoiselle!\u201d exclaimed a voice from behind the trees. \u201cMadame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the drawing-room.\u201d \u201cA visitor?\u201d inquired Valentine, much agitated; \u201cwho is it?\u201d \u201cSome grand personage\u2014a prince I believe they said\u2014the Count of Monte Cristo.\u201d \u201cI will come directly,\u201d cried Valentine aloud. The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate, to whom Valentine\u2019s _\u201cI am coming\u201d_ was the customary signal of farewell. \u201cNow, then,\u201d said Maximilian, leaning on the handle of his spade, \u201cI would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of Monte Cristo is acquainted with M. de Villefort.\u201d Chapter 52. Toxicology It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villefort\u2019s for the purpose of returning the procureur\u2019s visit, and at his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in confusion.", " The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the room. With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair, covered with white satin embroidered with gold. The count sat down. 20335m \u201cI have the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo.\u201d The count bowed. \u201cAnd I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the Legion of Honor, and member of the Chamber of Deputies?\u201d Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron\u2019s card. Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips. \u201cYou will, I trust, excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your title when I first addressed you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government, and that I am myself a representative of the liberties of the people.\u201d \u201cSo much so,\u201d replied Monte Cristo, \u201cthat while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count.\u201d \u201cUpon my word, monsieur,\u201d said Danglars with affected carelessness, \u201cI attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is, I was made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor, in return for services rendered, but\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cBut you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette?"], "Viscount Albert de Morcerf is the son of which character?": [" Come, shall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter\u2019s?\u201d Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five o\u2019clock, the young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay to pass a fortnight at Venice. But, ere he entered his travelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo, on which, beneath the name of Viscount Albert de Morcerf, he had written in pencil: \u201c27, _Rue du Helder, on the_ 21_st May, half-past ten_ A.M.\u201d Chapter 39. The Guests In the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite another building, in which were the servants\u2019 apartments.", " \u201cYes,\u201d replied Franz, \u201chere I am,\u201d and he, in his turn, left the caves. They advanced to the plain. \u201cAh, your pardon,\u201d said Albert, turning round; \u201cwill you allow me, captain?\u201d And he lighted his cigar at Vampa\u2019s torch. \u201cNow, my dear count,\u201d he said, \u201clet us on with all the speed we may. I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of Bracciano\u2019s.\u201d They found the carriage where they had left it. The count said a word in Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed. It was just two o\u2019clock by Albert\u2019s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they entered together, all uneasiness on Albert\u2019s account ceased instantly. \u201cMadame,\u201d said the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the countess, \u201cyesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; I am rather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend, whose character for veracity you well know, and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine.\u201d And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz, Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess, and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers.", " \u201cTo the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es,\u201d said the general; \u201cthe Count of Monte Cristo\u2019s. Hurry!\u201d The horses bounded beneath the whip; and in five minutes they stopped before the count\u2019s door. M. de Morcerf opened the door himself, and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered the open door with his servant. A moment afterwards, Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte Cristo, and the latter, leading Hayd\u00e9e aside, ordered that Morcerf be asked into the drawing-room. The general was pacing the room the third time when, in turning, he perceived Monte Cristo at the door. \u201cAh, it is M. de Morcerf,\u201d said Monte Cristo quietly; \u201cI thought I had not heard aright.\u201d \u201cYes, it is I,\u201d said the count, whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely. \u201cMay I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing M. de Morcerf so early?\u201d \u201cHad you not a meeting with my son this morning?\u201d asked the general.", " \u201cTo what do you allude, monsieur?\u201d said Danglars; as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general\u2019s words. \u201cAh,\u201d said Morcerf, \u201cI see you are a stickler for forms, my dear sir, and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted. _Ma foi_, I beg your pardon, but as I have but one son, and it is the first time I have ever thought of marrying him, I am still serving my apprenticeship, you know; come, I will reform.\u201d And Morcerf with a forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to M. Danglars, said: \u201cBaron, I have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eug\u00e9nie Danglars for my son, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.\u201d But Danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which Morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the count, who was still standing, to take a seat, he said: \u201cMonsieur, it will be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer.\u201d \u201cTo reflect?\u201d said Morcerf, more and more astonished; \u201chave you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us?\u201d \u201cCount,\u201d said the banker, \u201cthings are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions, or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them.\u201d \u201cI do not understand you, baron,\u201d said Morcerf."], "Albert de Morcert and Franz d\u2019Epinay are in Rome to attend a carnival that precedes which religious holiday?": [" With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night; and then supper, Sinbad, hashish, statues,\u2014all became a dream for Franz. The boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the sun rose, they had lost sight of Monte Cristo. When Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot, for the moment at least, the events which had just passed, while he finished his affairs of pleasure at Florence, and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion, who was awaiting him at Rome. He set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by the mail-coach. An apartment, as we have said, had been retained beforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini\u2019s hotel. But this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with people, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great events in every year,\u2014the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the Feast of St. Peter.", " \u201cWell,\u201d said Franz to Albert, \u201cdo you know what is the best thing we can do? It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.\u201d \u201cAh, the devil, no,\u201d cried Albert; \u201cI came to Rome to see the Carnival, and I will, though I see it on stilts.\u201d \u201cBravo! an excellent idea. We will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete success.\u201d \u201cDo your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday morning?\u201d \u201c_Parbleu!_\u201d said Albert, \u201cdo you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome, like lawyers\u2019 clerks?\u201d \u201cI hasten to comply with your excellencies\u2019 wishes; only, I tell you beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.\u201d \u201cAnd, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next apartments,\u201d said Franz, \u201cI warn you, that as I have been four times before at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you will make a good profit.\u201d \u201cBut, excellency\u201d\u2014said Pastrini, still striving to gain his point.", " At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound. This time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half fainting, into a seat. Albert, with his eyes closed, was standing grasping the window-curtains. The count was erect and triumphant, like the Avenging Angel! Chapter 36. The Carnival at Rome When Franz recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of water, of which, to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need; and the count, who was assuming his masquerade costume. He glanced mechanically towards the piazza\u2014the scene was wholly changed; scaffold, executioners, victims, all had disappeared; only the people remained, full of noise and excitement. The bell of Monte Citorio, which only sounds on the pope\u2019s decease and the opening of the Carnival, was ringing a joyous peal. \u201cWell,\u201d asked he of the count, \u201cwhat has, then, happened?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the count; \u201conly, as you see, the Carnival has commenced.", " \u201cAnd now,\u201d said the unknown, \u201cfarewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude! Farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart! I have been Heaven\u2019s substitute to recompense the good\u2014now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked!\u201d At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal, the yacht instantly put out to sea. Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor Towards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the first society of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy, should act as _cicerone_ to Albert. As it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome, especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del Popolo, or the Campo Vaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the proprietor of the H\u00f4tel de Londres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve comfortable apartments for them."], "Who is Luigi Vampa?": [" \u201cAnd I thank you; have what you will;\u201d and he made a sign to Franz to take what he pleased. \u201cIs it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?\u201d asked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count. \u201cJudge for yourself,\u201d replied he. \u201cThe postscript is explicit.\u201d \u201cI think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation,\u201d said Franz. \u201cHow so?\u201d returned the count, with surprise. \u201cIf we were to go together to Luigi Vampa, I am sure he would not refuse you Albert\u2019s freedom.\u201d \u201cWhat influence can I possibly have over a bandit?\u201d \u201cHave you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d \u201cHave you not saved Peppino\u2019s life?\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said the count, \u201cwho told you that?\u201d \u201cNo matter; I know it.\u201d The count knit his brows, and remained silent an instant. \u201cAnd if I went to seek Vampa, would you accompany me?\u201d \u201cIf my society would not be disagreeable.\u201d \u201cBe it so.", " \u201c\u2018Ah, I understand,\u2019 said the lieutenant; \u2018and you seek admittance into our ranks?\u2019 \u201c\u2018Welcome!\u2019 cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara, and Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa. \u201c\u2018Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your companion.\u2019 \u201c\u2018And what may that be?\u2019 inquired the bandits with astonishment. \u201c\u2018I come to ask to be your captain,\u2019 said the young man. \u201cThe bandits shouted with laughter. \u201c\u2018And what have you done to aspire to this honor?\u2019 demanded the lieutenant. \u201c\u2018I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear; and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my betrothed.\u2019 \u201cAn hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto, deceased.\u201d 20129m \u201cWell, my dear Albert,\u201d said Franz, turning towards his friend; \u201cwhat think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?\u201d \u201cI say he is a myth,\u201d replied Albert, \u201cand never had an existence.\u201d \u201cAnd what may a myth be?\u201d inquired Pastrini.", " By heavens! if I thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency, I would blow his brains out with my own hand!\u201d 20211m \u201cWell,\u201d said the count, turning towards Franz, \u201cI told you there was some mistake in this.\u201d \u201cAre you not alone?\u201d asked Vampa with uneasiness. \u201cI am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom I desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word. Come, your excellency,\u201d the count added, turning to Franz, \u201chere is Luigi Vampa, who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed.\u201d Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet him. \u201cWelcome among us, your excellency,\u201d he said to him; \u201cyou heard what the count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would not for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend\u2019s ransom, that this had happened.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said Franz, looking round him uneasily, \u201cwhere is the viscount?\u2014I do not see him.\u201d \u201cNothing has happened to him, I hope,\u201d said the count frowningly.", " \u201cTeresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into a dressing-room. \u201cLuigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road, and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him. \u201cLuigi was not mistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at a distance of a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways, and on reaching these the traveller might again stray from his route, he begged Luigi to be his guide. \u201cLuigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep up with."], "According to the Roman hotel owner, which lost traveler gave Luigi Vampa two small jewels in exchange for directions?": [" \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the brigadier; \u2018and as his head is valued at a thousand Roman crowns, there would have been five hundred for you, if you had helped us to catch him.\u2019 The two young persons exchanged looks. The brigadier had a moment\u2019s hope.

The whole of the property, consisting of an immense workshop, two pavilions at the bottom of the garden, and the garden itself, had been purchased by Emmanuel, who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation. He had reserved the house and half the garden, and building a wall between the garden and the workshops, had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden.

Speak, then, without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; I do not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to speak; besides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to God, and not to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.\u201d This positive assurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage.", " He is, I think, the son of General d\u2019\u00c9pinay?\u201d \u201cHe is.\u201d \u201cThe same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?\u201d \u201cBy the Bonapartists.\u201d \u201cYes.

Excited beyond his usual calm demeanor, Franz rose with the audience, and was about to join the loud, enthusiastic applause that followed; but suddenly his purpose was arrested, his hands fell by his sides, and the half-uttered \u201cbravos\u201d expired on his lips. The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand up in front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, Franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte Cristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him."], "Whose devoted servant is Barrois?": [" \u201cIs that what you wish for?\u201d asked she. \u201cNo.\u201d She took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty. \u201cBut there are no more,\u201d said she.

Morrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years of age; Morrel was deeply in love, and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion. These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of a triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet nevertheless possessing their point of union. This point of union was Noirtier, and it was he who had just sent for Morrel, with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him\u2014a command which Morrel obeyed to the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois. On arriving at the house, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends wings to our desires; but Barrois, who had long forgotten what it was to love, was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use. The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance, closed the door of the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of Valentine.", " \u201cDoctor d\u2019Avrigny,\u201d said Barrois, staggering as if he would fall. \u201cWhat is the matter, Barrois?\u201d said Valentine.

The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased, the features of the face became quite altered, and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder. Noirtier, seeing Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man. Barrois made some steps towards his master. \u201cAh, sir,\u201d said he, \u201ctell me what is the matter with me. I am suffering\u2014I cannot see. A thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain.

I had a betrothed, Albert, a lovely girl whom I adored, and I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis, painfully amassed by ceaseless toil. This money was for her; I destined it for her, and, knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles, on the All\u00e9es de Meilhan. Your mother, Albert, knows that poor house well. A short time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old place, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening I took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed my treasure.

I may acknowledge this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime.\u201d \u201cThis is not to the purpose,\u201d said Eug\u00e9nie; \u201clet us speak candidly, sir; I admire candor.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Danglars, \u201cI can, when circumstances render it desirable, adopt your system, although it may not be my general practice. I will therefore proceed.

At his mother\u2019s ball he danced once with Eug\u00e9nie, and M. Cavalcanti three times, and he took no notice of it.\u201d The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf. The baroness rose hastily, and was going into the study, when Danglars stopped her. \u201cLet her alone,\u201d said he. She looked at him in amazement.

The young man closed the door behind him, and advanced towards the major, who had risen when he heard steps approaching him. \u201cAh, my dear father!\u201d said Andrea in a loud voice, in order that the count might hear him in the next room, \u201cis it really you?\u201d \u201cHow do you do, my dear son?\u201d said the major gravely. \u201cAfter so many years of painful separation,\u201d said Andrea, in the same tone of voice, and glancing towards the door, \u201cwhat a happiness it is to meet again!\u201d \u201cIndeed it is, after so long a separation.\u201d \u201cWill you not embrace me, sir?\u201d said Andrea.", " Andrea assumed his gayest manner. \u201cYou know, my dear count,\u201d said he, \u201cthe ceremony is to take place this evening.

Besides, had he not begged of Morcerf not to mention his father\u2019s name before Hayd\u00e9e? Lastly, he had taken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged; Monte Cristo then was in league with his father\u2019s enemies. Albert took Beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him. \u201cYou are right,\u201d said the latter; \u201cM.

Then, turning towards Albert,\u2014\u201cIt is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern Greek, both of which Hayd\u00e9e speaks so fluently; the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian, which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation.\u201d The count made a sign to Hayd\u00e9e to address his visitor.", " Monte Cristo arose and approached her, took her hand, and said to her in Romaic: \u201cCalm yourself, my dear child, and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will punish traitors.\u201d \u201cIt is a frightful story, count,\u201d said Albert, terrified at the paleness of Hayd\u00e9e\u2019s countenance, \u201cand I reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request.\u201d \u201cOh, it is nothing,\u201d said Monte Cristo.

Every transport of a daughter finding a father, all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover, were felt by Hayd\u00e9e during the first moments of this meeting, which she had so eagerly expected. Doubtless, although less evident, Monte Cristo\u2019s joy was not less intense. Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is outwardly apparent. Monte Cristo was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time dared to believe, that there were two Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s in the world, and he might yet be happy.

Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned anxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform of a sub-lieutenant, stood before her. \u201cIt was not the one she wished for most, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her. \u201cMerc\u00e9d\u00e8s seized Fernand\u2019s hands with a transport which he took for love, but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing at last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow.", " Fernand\u2019s mind was made up; he would shoot Dant\u00e8s, and then kill himself. But Fernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself, for he constantly hopes. During this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man in France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have done so when he parted from Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.

Close to him, dressed in entirely new clothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful son, whom we also know.

Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say. Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly\u2019s fingers, and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantio\u2019s malediction on Desdemona. At the end of the piece \u00c9tienne entered, and announced to Eug\u00e9nie that the horses were to the carriage, and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits.

The Contract Three days after the scene we have just described, namely towards five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between Mademoiselle Eug\u00e9nie Danglars and Andrea Cavalcanti, whom the banker persisted in calling prince, a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the Count of Monte Cristo\u2019s house, and the count was preparing to go out."], "What does Danglars intend to invest in with the money gained by Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s marriage?": [" But three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti. It was expected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young man was received at the banker\u2019s as the betrothed. Letters had been despatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count\u2019s father, who highly approved of the union, regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time, and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres. It was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to invest; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father-in-law, who had of late sustained repeated losses; but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron.", " \u201cMy poor Eug\u00e9nie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.\u201d \u201cI admire all that is beautiful,\u201d returned the young lady. \u201cWhat do you think of the count?\u201d inquired Debray; \u201che is not much amiss, according to my ideas of good looks.\u201d \u201cThe count,\u201d repeated Eug\u00e9nie, as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner; \u201cthe count?\u2014oh, he is so dreadfully pale.\u201d \u201cI quite agree with you,\u201d said Morcerf; \u201cand the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out.

A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two young girls, having told him to take it to No. 36, Rue de la Victoire, walked behind this man, whose presence comforted Louise. As for Eug\u00e9nie, she was as strong as a Judith or a Delilah. They arrived at the appointed spot. Eug\u00e9nie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau, gave him some pieces of money, and having rapped at the shutter sent him away. The shutter where Eug\u00e9nie had rapped was that of a little laundress, who had been previously warned, and was not yet gone to bed. She opened the door. \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d said Eug\u00e9nie, \u201clet the porter get the post-chaise from the coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the hotel.

She was fearful of exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter\u2019s innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof. She listened at Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s door, and hearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place. Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to sleep. She called the maid and questioned her. \u201cMademoiselle Eug\u00e9nie,\u201d said the maid, \u201cretired to her apartment with Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they desired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.\u201d Since then the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore, went to bed without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the recent events."], "Who does Eug\u00e9nie plan to run away with to Italy?": [" Why do you not realize a six months\u2019, a year\u2019s advance even, and retire to Brussels?

At the same minute, one of the little windows of the H\u00f4tel de Ville was thrown open, and the head of a gendarme appeared. For an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building, then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared.

The two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example. They advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a chain, near the quay. The soldiers looked at Dant\u00e8s with an air of stupid curiosity. In an instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the Pilon.

Then she ventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw a woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass. During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept: it was Madame de Villefort.", " \u201cM.

M. de Villefort, a true Parisian, considered the cemetery of P\u00e8re-Lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates. He had therefore purchased a vault, which was quickly occupied by members of his family. On the front of the monument was inscribed: \u201cThe families of Saint-M\u00e9ran and Villefort,\u201d for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Ren\u00e9e, Valentine\u2019s mother.", " \u201cI think he is about to leave Paris; he was going to his banker.\u201d \u201cHis banker? Danglars is his banker, is he not?\u201d asked Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud of Debray. \u201cI believe so,\u201d replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. \u201cBut Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel.\u201d \u201cMorrel? Do they know him?\u201d asked Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud. \u201cI think he has only been introduced to Madame de Villefort.\u201d \u201cStill, he ought to have been here,\u201d said Debray; \u201cI wonder what will be talked about tonight; this funeral is the news of the day. But hush, here comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin,\u201d and the three young men drew near to listen. Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e d\u2019Antin, to M. Danglars\u2019. The banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard, and advanced to meet him with a sad, though affable smile.", " They arrived in about an hour at the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with the funeral ceremony. Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault, Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone in a cabriolet, and walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees. \u201cYou here?\u201d said Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, passing his arms through the young captain\u2019s; \u201care you a friend of Villefort\u2019s? How is it that I have never met you at his house?\u201d \u201cI am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort\u2019s,\u201d answered Morrel, \u201cbut I was of Madame de Saint-M\u00e9ran.\u201d Albert came up to them at this moment with Franz. \u201cThe time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.\u201d said Albert; \u201cbut we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to present to you M. Franz d\u2019\u00c9pinay, a delightful travelling companion, with whom I made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilian Morrel, an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you will hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection, wit, or amiability.\u201d Morrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing, but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz.", " The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was evidently watching for someone, but his search ended in disappointment. 50119m \u201cWhere is Morrel?\u201d he asked; \u201cdo either of these gentlemen know where he is?\u201d \u201cWe have already asked that question,\u201d said Ch\u00e2teau-Renaud, \u201cfor none of us has seen him.\u201d The count was silent, but continued to gaze around him. At length they arrived at the cemetery. The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees, and was soon relieved from all anxiety, for seeing a shadow glide between the yew-trees, Monte Cristo recognized him whom he sought. One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis. Black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments; then follows the melancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then with a sob of anguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers."], "After the heartbroken Maximillian expresses his intent to commit suicide, Monte Cristo convinces him to wait ___.": [" Ah, sir, indeed you would inspire me with pity, were you not hateful in my eyes.\u201d \u201cMorrel\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cYes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and I will do so, be satisfied! When you spoke to me at the cemetery, I answered you\u2014my heart was softened; when you arrived here, I allowed you to enter. But since you abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture after I thought I had exhausted them all, then, Count of Monte Cristo my pretended benefactor\u2014then, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal guardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;\u201d and Morrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols. \u201cAnd I again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.\u201d \u201cPrevent me, then!\u201d replied Morrel, with another struggle, which, like the first, failed in releasing him from the count\u2019s iron grasp. \u201cI will prevent you.\u201d 50127m \u201cAnd who are you, then, that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings?\u201d \u201cWho am I?\u201d repeated Monte Cristo.", " Come\u2014do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is capable? do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control? nay, that he can almost work a miracle? Well, wait for the miracle I hope to accomplish, or\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cOr?\u201d repeated Morrel. \u201cOr, take care, Morrel, lest I call you ungrateful.\u201d \u201cHave pity on me, count!\u201d \u201cI feel so much pity towards you, Maximilian, that\u2014listen to me attentively\u2014if I do not cure you in a month, to the day, to the very hour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place loaded pistols before you, and a cup of the deadliest Italian poison\u2014a poison more sure and prompt than that which has killed Valentine.\u201d \u201cWill you promise me?\u201d \u201cYes; for I am a man, and have suffered like yourself, and also contemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune has left me I have longed for the delights of an eternal sleep.\u201d \u201cBut you are sure you will promise me this?\u201d said Morrel, intoxicated.", " \u201cGood,\u201d said Monte Cristo, smiling; \u201cin these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well-disciplined soldier.\u201d \u201cAnd you leave us,\u201d said Julie, \u201cat a moment\u2019s warning? you do not give us a day\u2014no, not even an hour before your departure?\u201d \u201cMy carriage is at the door, madame, and I must be in Rome in five days.\u201d \u201cBut does Maximilian go to Rome?\u201d exclaimed Emmanuel. \u201cI am going wherever it may please the count to take me,\u201d said Morrel, with a smile full of grief; \u201cI am under his orders for the next month.\u201d \u201cOh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!\u201d said Julie. \u201cMaximilian goes with _me_,\u201d said the count, in his kindest and most persuasive manner; \u201ctherefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother\u2019s account.\u201d \u201cOnce more farewell, my dear sister; Emmanuel, adieu!\u201d Morrel repeated. \u201cHis carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart,\u201d said Julie. \u201cOh, Maximilian, Maximilian, you are certainly concealing something from us.\u201d \u201cPshaw!\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cyou will see him return to you gay, smiling, and joyful.\u201d Maximilian cast a look of disdain, almost of anger, on the count.", " But, alas, I have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security; I trust we shall never find it so in our experience!\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d cried Morrel, almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before Noirtier and Valentine, and to adore them as two superior beings, \u201cwhat have I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness?\u201d \u201cUntil that time,\u201d continued the young girl in a calm and self-possessed tone of voice, \u201cwe will conform to circumstances, and be guided by the wishes of our friends, so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us; in a word, and I repeat it, because it expresses all I wish to convey,\u2014we will wait.\u201d \u201cAnd I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes, sir,\u201d said Morrel, \u201cnot only with resignation, but with cheerfulness.\u201d \u201cTherefore,\u201d continued Valentine, looking playfully at Maximilian, \u201cno more inconsiderate actions\u2014no more rash projects; for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined, honorably and happily, to bear your name?\u201d Morrel looked obedience to her commands."], "In running away, Danglars leaves behind an enormous unpaid debt to ___.": [" Cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo. \u201cCome,\u201d said Madame Danglars, \u201cleave music and compliments, and let us go and take tea.\u201d \u201cCome, Louise,\u201d said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend. They passed into the next drawing-room, where tea was prepared. Just as they were beginning, in the English fashion, to leave the spoons in their cups, the door again opened and Danglars entered, visibly agitated. Monte Cristo observed it particularly, and by a look asked the banker for an explanation. \u201cI have just received my courier from Greece,\u201d said Danglars. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d said the count; \u201cthat was the reason of your running away from us.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHow is King Otho getting on?\u201d asked Albert in the most sprightly tone. Danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering, and Monte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features, but which was gone in a moment.", " Eug\u00e9nie closed her eyes; but though she could not see, she could hear, and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage. \u201cOh, why is not the world a wilderness?\u201d she exclaimed, throwing herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly, her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world had but one neck, that he might sever it at a single blow. The next day they stopped at the H\u00f4tel de Flandre, at Brussels. The same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie. Chapter 99. The Law We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d\u2019Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs. We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness, who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, Lucien Debray.", " \u201cBut you are deceived, Edmond,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou have no enemy here\u2014there is no one but Fernand, my brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.\u201d And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and offered him his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave, was broken against the strong ascendancy which Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s exercised over him. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmond\u2019s hand when he felt he had done all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house. \u201cOh,\u201d he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair\u2014\u201cOh, who will deliver me from this man? Wretched\u2014wretched that I am!\u201d \u201cHallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?\u201d exclaimed a voice. The young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.", " \u201cNow, madame,\u201d continued Debray, first opening the closet, then the chest;\u2014\u201cnow, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each, resembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this I add a certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs; then, for the odd cash, making I think about 110,000 francs, here is a check upon my banker, who, not being M. Danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest assured.\u201d Madame Danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the heap of bank-notes. This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table. Madame Danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put the certificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale and mute, awaited one kind word of consolation. But she waited in vain. \u201cNow, madame,\u201d said Debray, \u201cyou have a splendid fortune, an income of about 60,000 livres a year, which is enormous for a woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year, at least."], "When Bertuccio visits Benedetto in prison, he is disgusted to learn that Benedetto believes his father is ___.": [" I will say\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cDo you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?\u201d said Bertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that Andrea was moved to the very soul. \u201cDo you think you have to do with galley-slaves, or novices in the world? Benedetto, you are fallen into terrible hands; they are ready to open for you\u2014make use of them. Do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment, but which they can take up again instantly, if you attempt to intercept their movements.\u201d 50157m \u201cMy father\u2014I will know who my father is,\u201d said the obstinate youth; \u201cI will perish if I must, but I _will_ know it. What does scandal signify to me? What possessions, what reputation, what \u2018pull,\u2019 as Beauchamp says,\u2014have I? You great people always lose something by scandal, notwithstanding your millions. Come, who is my father?\u201d \u201cI came to tell you.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy.", " The coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace; for like all galley-slaves, you said, \u2018I may escape from prison, I cannot from the grave.\u2019 And you said truly; the way was opened for you unexpectedly. An Englishman visited Toulon, who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy, and his choice fell on you and your companion. You received a second fortune, money and tranquillity were restored to you, and you, who had been condemned to a felon\u2019s life, might live as other men. Then, wretched creature, then you tempted God a third time. \u2018I have not enough,\u2019 you said, when you had more than you before possessed, and you committed a third crime, without reason, without excuse. God is wearied; he has punished you.\u201d Caderousse was fast sinking. \u201cGive me drink,\u201d said he: \u201cI thirst\u2014I burn!\u201d Monte Cristo gave him a glass of water. \u201cAnd yet that villain, Benedetto, will escape!\u201d \u201cNo one, I tell you, will escape; Benedetto will be punished.\u201d \u201cThen, you, too, will be punished, for you did not do your duty as a priest\u2014you should have prevented Benedetto from killing me.\u201d \u201cI?\u201d said the count, with a smile which petrified the dying man, \u201cwhen you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast!", " You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer.\u2019 \u201cThe arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto rejoined his associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool.\u201d \u201cSweet child,\u201d murmured Monte Cristo. \u201cOh, had he been my own son,\u201d replied Bertuccio, \u201cor even my nephew, I would have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was striking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me to punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the unfortunate boy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was already made up. Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the fit seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week.", " \u201cStop! You are in a shocking hurry to be off\u2014you forget one of my guests. Lean a little to the left. Stay! look at M.

Bertuccio,\u201d said the count severely; \u201cI ordered dinner at that hour, and I do not like to wait;\u201d and he returned to his guests, while Bertuccio, leaning against the wall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. Five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Bertuccio appearing said, with a violent effort, \u201cThe dinner waits.\u201d The Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort. \u201cM. de Villefort,\u201d he said, \u201cwill you conduct the Baroness Danglars?\u201d Villefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room."], "On the day of Benedetto\u2019s trial, what does Villefort instruct his wife to do?": [" \u201cOh, you do not know what is seventeen months in prison!\u2014seventeen ages rather, especially to a man who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition\u2014to a man, who, like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant\u2014who sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living!

She said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case, and that you should take something to keep up your strength;\u201d and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers. The valet then left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion, he swallowed its contents at one draught. It might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil. He then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness. The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort felt no effects. The breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The valet re-entered. \u201cMadame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cthat eleven o\u2019clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Villefort, \u201cwhat then?\u201d \u201cMadame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know if she is to accompany you, sir?\u201d \u201cWhere to?\u201d \u201cTo the Palais.\u201d \u201cWhat to do?\u201d \u201cMy mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Villefort, with a startling accent; \u201cdoes she wish that?\u201d The servant drew back and said, \u201cIf you wish to go alone, sir, I will go and tell my mistress.\u201d Villefort remained silent for a moment, and dented his pale cheeks with his nails.", " If I find you alive on my return, you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie.\u201d Madame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the carpet. The king\u2019s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity; he looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly: \u201cFarewell, madame, farewell!\u201d That farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner\u2019s knife. She fainted. The procureur went out, after having double-locked the door. Chapter 109. The Assizes The Benedetto affair, as it was called at the Palais, and by people in general, had produced a tremendous sensation. Frequenting the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his brief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as the man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains.", " The assizes, also, were about to begin, and Villefort, shut up in his room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse. This affair, like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in Paris. The proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death-bed, and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion. But the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart. The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of Villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes. He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial."], "During Benedetto\u2019s highly public trial, he announces that he is the son of ___.": [" Answer me!\u201d \u201cOn what I could get.\u201d \u201cYou lie,\u201d repeated the abb\u00e9 a third time, with a still more imperative tone.

During the reading of this, which was long, the public attention was continually drawn towards Andrea, who bore the inspection with Spartan unconcern. Villefort had never been so concise and eloquent. The crime was depicted in the most vivid colors; the former life of the prisoner, his transformation, a review of his life from the earliest period, were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur. Benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced. Andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him.", " \u201cOh, you do not know what is seventeen months in prison!\u2014seventeen ages rather, especially to a man who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition\u2014to a man, who, like me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an honorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant\u2014who sees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living!

M. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or rather threw himself down again upon his chair. \u201cAnd now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?\u201d said the president. \u201cThe brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to humanity. You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be for this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name. You wished it to be preceded by all these titles.\u201d \u201cIt is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my thoughts,\u201d said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner. \u201cThis is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the questions.\u201d The public astonishment had reached its height."], "In response to Edward\u2019s death, what emotion does Monte Cristo experience vis-a-vis his quest for vengeance?": [" \u201cYes,\u201d continued Morrel, \u201cdeath had entered that house twice within one month.\u201d \u201cAnd what did the doctor answer?\u201d asked Monte Cristo. \u201cHe replied\u2014he replied, that the death was not a natural one, and must be attributed\u201d\u2014 \u201cTo what?\u201d \u201cTo poison.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d said Monte Cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush, or his pallor, or the intense interest with which he listened; \u201cindeed, Maximilian, did you hear that?\u201d \u201cYes, my dear count, I heard it; and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice.\u201d Monte Cristo listened, or appeared to do so, with the greatest calmness. \u201cWell,\u201d said Maximilian, \u201cdeath came a third time, and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word. Death is now, perhaps, striking a fourth blow. Count, what am I bound to do, being in possession of this secret?\u201d \u201cMy dear friend,\u201d said Monte Cristo, \u201cyou appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart.", " \u201cAh, here you are, monsieur,\u201d she said in her naturally calm voice; \u201cbut how pale you are! Have you been working all night? Why did you not come down to breakfast? Well, will you take me, or shall I take Edward?\u201d Madame de Villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer, but to all her inquiries M. de Villefort remained mute and cold as a statue. \u201cEdward,\u201d said Villefort, fixing an imperious glance on the child, \u201cgo and play in the drawing-room, my dear; I wish to speak to your mamma.\u201d Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance, that resolute tone, and the awfully strange preliminaries. Edward raised his head, looked at his mother, and then, finding that she did not confirm the order, began cutting off the heads of his leaden soldiers. \u201cEdward,\u201d cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up from the floor, \u201cdo you hear me?\u2014Go!\u201d The child, unaccustomed to such treatment, arose, pale and trembling; it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion.", " \u201cH\u00e9lo\u00efse, H\u00e9lo\u00efse!\u201d he said, \u201cwhat is the matter?

Villefort ran to her and seized her hand, which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper. Madame de Villefort was dead. Villefort, maddened with horror, stepped back to the threshhold of the door, fixing his eyes on the corpse. \u201cMy son!\u201d he exclaimed suddenly, \u201cwhere is my son?\u2014Edward, Edward!\u201d and he rushed out of the room, still crying, \u201cEdward, Edward!\u201d The name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up. \u201cWhere is my son?\u201d asked Villefort; \u201clet him be removed from the house, that he may not see\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cMaster Edward is not downstairs, sir,\u201d replied the valet. \u201cThen he must be playing in the garden; go and see.\u201d 50193m \u201cNo, sir; Madame de Villefort sent for him half an hour ago; he went into her room, and has not been downstairs since.\u201d A cold perspiration burst out on Villefort\u2019s brow; his legs trembled, and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch.", " \u201cIn Madame de Villefort\u2019s room?\u201d he murmured and slowly returned, with one hand wiping his forehead, and with the other supporting himself against the wall. To enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife. To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb. His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth. \u201cEdward!\u201d he stammered\u2014\u201cEdward!\u201d The child did not answer. Where, then, could he be, if he had entered his mother\u2019s room and not since returned? He stepped forward. The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which Edward must be; those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold, and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony.

The Fifth of October VOLUME ONE Chapter 1. Marseilles\u2014The Arrival On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island. Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the _Pharaon_, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city. The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pom\u00e8gue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board.", " \u201cWhat think you, Danglars,\u201d said one of the party, turning towards him, \u201cof this event?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied he, \u201cI think it just possible Dant\u00e8s may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband.\u201d \u201cBut how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the ship\u2019s supercargo?\u201d \u201cWhy, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret\u2019s warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal\u2019s; that is all I was obliged to know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.\u201d \u201cNow I recollect,\u201d said the afflicted old father; \u201cmy poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for me!\u201d \u201cThere, you see,\u201d exclaimed Danglars. \u201cNow the mischief is out; depend upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dant\u00e8s\u2019 hidden treasures.\u201d Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover\u2019s arrest.", " If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cIs all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.\u201d Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted: \u201cStand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!\u201d The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-of-war. \u201cLet go\u2014and clue up!\u201d At this last command all the sails were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards. \u201cNow, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,\u201d said Dant\u00e8s, observing the owner\u2019s impatience, \u201chere is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.\u201d The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which Dant\u00e8s flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner.", " \u201cWe shall go together, shall we not?\u201d said Albert to the count. \u201cIf you like,\u201d replied the latter. Albert could not understand the banker\u2019s look, and turning to Monte Cristo, who understood it perfectly,\u2014\u201cDid you see,\u201d said he, \u201chow he looked at me?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the count; \u201cbut did you think there was anything particular in his look?\u201d \u201cIndeed, I did; and what does he mean by his news from Greece?\u201d \u201cHow can I tell you?\u201d \u201cBecause I imagine you have correspondents in that country.\u201d Monte Cristo smiled significantly. \u201cStop,\u201d said Albert, \u201chere he comes.

He easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father\u2019s honor; but when that was done, why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms? It was then, when the count could not see Albert, that he sent for his servant, who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him. Ten minutes afterwards, General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar, black pantaloons, and black gloves. He had apparently given previous orders, for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach-house ready for him. The valet threw into the carriage his military cloak, in which two swords were wrapped, and, shutting the door, he took his seat by the side of the coachman. The coachman stooped down for his orders.", " \u201cWhat name did you pronounce then, Madame de Morcerf?\u201d said he. \u201cYours!\u201d cried she, throwing back her veil,\u2014\u201cyours, which I alone, perhaps, have not forgotten.

On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell. \u201cAre you not a Christian?\u201d he said, falling on his knees. \u201cDo you wish to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of Heaven, is a brother?
