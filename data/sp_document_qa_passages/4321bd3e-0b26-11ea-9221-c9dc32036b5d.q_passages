{"To which citydoes Romeo go after being exiled from Verona?": [" FRIAR LAWRENCE, a Franciscan. FRIAR JOHN, of the same Order. An Apothecary. CHORUS. Three Musicians. An Officer. Citizens of Verona; several Men and Women, relations to both houses; Maskers, Guards, Watchmen and Attendants. SCENE. During the greater part of the Play in Verona; once, in the Fifth Act, at Mantua. THE PROLOGUE Enter Chorus. CHORUS. Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross\u2019d lovers take their life; Whose misadventur\u2019d piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents\u2019 strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark\u2019d love, And the continuance of their parents\u2019 rage, Which, but their children\u2019s end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours\u2019 traffic of our stage; The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.", " CAPULET. Why how now, kinsman! Wherefore storm you so? TYBALT. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe; A villain that is hither come in spite, To scorn at our solemnity this night. CAPULET. Young Romeo, is it? TYBALT. \u2019Tis he, that villain Romeo. CAPULET. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone, A bears him like a portly gentleman; And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-govern\u2019d youth. I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient, take no note of him, It is my will; the which if thou respect, Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. TYBALT. It fits when such a villain is a guest: I\u2019ll not endure him. CAPULET. He shall be endur\u2019d. What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to; Am I the master here, or you? Go to. You\u2019ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul, You\u2019ll make a mutiny among my guests!", " LADY CAPULET. Marry, that marry is the very theme I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married? JULIET. It is an honour that I dream not of. NURSE. An honour! Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck\u2019d wisdom from thy teat. LADY CAPULET. Well, think of marriage now: younger than you, Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers. By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief; The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. NURSE. A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world\u2014why he\u2019s a man of wax. LADY CAPULET. Verona\u2019s summer hath not such a flower. NURSE. Nay, he\u2019s a flower, in faith a very flower. LADY CAPULET. What say you, can you love the gentleman? This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o\u2019er the volume of young Paris\u2019 face, And find delight writ there with beauty\u2019s pen.", " ROMEO. What less than doomsday is the Prince\u2019s doom? FRIAR LAWRENCE. A gentler judgment vanish\u2019d from his lips, Not body\u2019s death, but body\u2019s banishment. ROMEO. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death; For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death. Do not say banishment. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. ROMEO. There is no world without Verona walls, But purgatory, torture, hell itself. Hence banished is banish\u2019d from the world, And world\u2019s exile is death. Then banished Is death misterm\u2019d. Calling death banished, Thou cutt\u2019st my head off with a golden axe, And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. FRIAR LAWRENCE. O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince, Taking thy part, hath brush\u2019d aside the law, And turn\u2019d that black word death to banishment.

BENVOLIO. Of love? ROMEO. Out of her favour where I am in love. BENVOLIO. Alas that love so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof. ROMEO.

My child is yet a stranger in the world, She hath not seen the change of fourteen years; Let two more summers wither in their pride Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. PARIS. Younger than she are happy mothers made. CAPULET. And too soon marr\u2019d are those so early made.

How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? FRIAR LAWRENCE. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. ROMEO. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel. Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, Doting like me, and like me banished, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, And fall upon the ground as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

During the greater part of the Play in Verona; once, in the Fifth Act, at Mantua. THE PROLOGUE Enter Chorus. CHORUS. Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross\u2019d lovers take their life; Whose misadventur\u2019d piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents\u2019 strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark\u2019d love, And the continuance of their parents\u2019 rage, Which, but their children\u2019s end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours\u2019 traffic of our stage; The which, if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.", " Prodigious birth of love it is to me, That I must love a loathed enemy.

Come let\u2019s away, the strangers all are gone. [_Exeunt._] ACT II Enter Chorus. CHORUS. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, And young affection gapes to be his heir; That fair for which love groan\u2019d for and would die, With tender Juliet match\u2019d, is now not fair. Now Romeo is belov\u2019d, and loves again, Alike bewitched by the charm of looks; But to his foe suppos\u2019d he must complain, And she steal love\u2019s sweet bait from fearful hooks: Being held a foe, he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere. But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.", " Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here\u2019s much to do with hate, but more with love: Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O anything, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health! Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! This love feel I, that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh? BENVOLIO. No coz, I rather weep. ROMEO. Good heart, at what? BENVOLIO. At thy good heart\u2019s oppression. ROMEO. Why such is love\u2019s transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs; Being purg\u2019d, a fire sparkling in lovers\u2019 eyes; Being vex\u2019d, a sea nourish\u2019d with lovers\u2019 tears: What is it else?", " PRINCE. And for that offence Immediately we do exile him hence. I have an interest in your hate\u2019s proceeding, My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding. But I\u2019ll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine. I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found, that hour is his last. Bear hence this body, and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. A Room in Capulet\u2019s House. Enter Juliet. JULIET. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, Towards Phoebus\u2019 lodging. Such a waggoner As Phaeton would whip you to the west And bring in cloudy night immediately. Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, That runaway\u2019s eyes may wink, and Romeo Leap to these arms, untalk\u2019d of and unseen. Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties: or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night."], "Why does Tybaltfirst challenge Romeo to a duel?": [" Comfort me, counsel me. Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself. What say\u2019st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, Nurse. NURSE. Faith, here it is. Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing That he dares ne\u2019er come back to challenge you. Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, I think it best you married with the County. O, he\u2019s a lovely gentleman. Romeo\u2019s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first: or if it did not, Your first is dead, or \u2019twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him.

Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.", " The other did not so. FRIAR LAWRENCE. O, she knew well Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell. But come young waverer, come go with me, In one respect I\u2019ll thy assistant be; For this alliance may so happy prove, To turn your households\u2019 rancour to pure love. ROMEO. O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. A Street. Enter Benvolio and Mercutio. MERCUTIO. Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight? BENVOLIO. Not to his father\u2019s; I spoke with his man. MERCUTIO. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad. BENVOLIO. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father\u2019s house. MERCUTIO. A challenge, on my life. BENVOLIO. Romeo will answer it. MERCUTIO. Any man that can write may answer a letter. BENVOLIO. Nay, he will answer the letter\u2019s master, how he dares, being dared.", " Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, We would as willingly give cure as know. Enter Romeo. BENVOLIO.

Was that my father that went hence so fast? BENVOLIO. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo\u2019s hours? ROMEO. Not having that which, having, makes them short. BENVOLIO. In love? ROMEO. Out. BENVOLIO. Of love? ROMEO. Out of her favour where I am in love. BENVOLIO. Alas that love so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof. ROMEO. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!", " [_Within._] Madam. JULIET. By and by I come\u2014 To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send. ROMEO. So thrive my soul,\u2014 JULIET. A thousand times good night. [_Exit._] ROMEO. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, towards school with heavy looks. [_Retiring slowly._] Re-enter Juliet, above. JULIET. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer\u2019s voice To lure this tassel-gentle back again. Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of my Romeo\u2019s name. ROMEO. It is my soul that calls upon my name. How silver-sweet sound lovers\u2019 tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears. JULIET. Romeo. ROMEO. My nyas? JULIET.

This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. LADY CAPULET. He is a kinsman to the Montague. Affection makes him false, he speaks not true. Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life. I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give; Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. PRINCE.

Then comes she to me, And with wild looks, bid me devise some means To rid her from this second marriage, Or in my cell there would she kill herself. Then gave I her, so tutored by my art, A sleeping potion, which so took effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo That he should hither come as this dire night To help to take her from her borrow\u2019d grave, Being the time the potion\u2019s force should cease. But he which bore my letter, Friar John, Was stay\u2019d by accident; and yesternight Return\u2019d my letter back.

Thou hast amaz\u2019d me. By my holy order, I thought thy disposition better temper\u2019d. Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself? And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives, By doing damned hate upon thyself? Why rail\u2019st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth? Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. Fie, fie, thou sham\u2019st thy shape, thy love, thy wit, Which, like a usurer, abound\u2019st in all, And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. Thy noble shape is but a form of wax, Digressing from the valour of a man; Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, Killing that love which thou hast vow\u2019d to cherish; Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, Misshapen in the conduct of them both, Like powder in a skilless soldier\u2019s flask, Is set afire by thine own ignorance, And thou dismember\u2019d with thine own defence.", " FRIAR LAWRENCE, a Franciscan.

Now Romeo is belov\u2019d, and loves again, Alike bewitched by the charm of looks; But to his foe suppos\u2019d he must complain, And she steal love\u2019s sweet bait from fearful hooks: Being held a foe, he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; And she as much in love, her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere. But passion lends them power, time means, to meet, Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.", " LADY CAPULET. Marry, that marry is the very theme I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, How stands your disposition to be married? JULIET. It is an honour that I dream not of. NURSE. An honour! Were not I thine only nurse, I would say thou hadst suck\u2019d wisdom from thy teat. LADY CAPULET. Well, think of marriage now: younger than you, Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, Are made already mothers. By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief; The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. NURSE. A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world\u2014why he\u2019s a man of wax. LADY CAPULET. Verona\u2019s summer hath not such a flower. NURSE. Nay, he\u2019s a flower, in faith a very flower. LADY CAPULET. What say you, can you love the gentleman? This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o\u2019er the volume of young Paris\u2019 face, And find delight writ there with beauty\u2019s pen.", " [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._] FIRST MUSICIAN. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone. NURSE. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up, For well you know this is a pitiful case. FIRST MUSICIAN. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

Why \u2018Heart\u2019s ease\u2019? PETER. O musicians, because my heart itself plays \u2018My heart is full\u2019. O play me some merry dump to comfort me. FIRST MUSICIAN. Not a dump we, \u2019tis no time to play now. PETER. You will not then? FIRST MUSICIAN. No. PETER. I will then give it you soundly. FIRST MUSICIAN. What will you give us? PETER.

Then will I lay the serving-creature\u2019s dagger on your pate."], "Which best describes the difference between the world of the nobles and the world of the servants": [" ROMEO. What less than doomsday is the Prince\u2019s doom? FRIAR LAWRENCE. A gentler judgment vanish\u2019d from his lips, Not body\u2019s death, but body\u2019s banishment. ROMEO. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death; For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death. Do not say banishment. FRIAR LAWRENCE. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. ROMEO. There is no world without Verona walls, But purgatory, torture, hell itself. Hence banished is banish\u2019d from the world, And world\u2019s exile is death. Then banished Is death misterm\u2019d. Calling death banished, Thou cutt\u2019st my head off with a golden axe, And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. FRIAR LAWRENCE. O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince, Taking thy part, hath brush\u2019d aside the law, And turn\u2019d that black word death to banishment. This is dear mercy, and thou see\u2019st it not.", " What, ho! Apothecary! Enter Apothecary. APOTHECARY. Who calls so loud? ROMEO. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear As will disperse itself through all the veins, That the life-weary taker may fall dead, And that the trunk may be discharg\u2019d of breath As violently as hasty powder fir\u2019d Doth hurry from the fatal cannon\u2019s womb. APOTHECARY. Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua\u2019s law Is death to any he that utters them. ROMEO. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear\u2019st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks, Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back. The world is not thy friend, nor the world\u2019s law; The world affords no law to make thee rich; Then be not poor, but break it and take this. APOTHECARY. My poverty, but not my will consents. ROMEO. I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.", " Comfort me, counsel me. Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems Upon so soft a subject as myself. What say\u2019st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort, Nurse. NURSE. Faith, here it is. Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing That he dares ne\u2019er come back to challenge you. Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, I think it best you married with the County. O, he\u2019s a lovely gentleman. Romeo\u2019s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first: or if it did not, Your first is dead, or \u2019twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him. JULIET. Speakest thou from thy heart? NURSE. And from my soul too, Or else beshrew them both. JULIET. Amen. NURSE. What? JULIET. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.", " Go thither and with unattainted eye, Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. ROMEO. When the devout religion of mine eye Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire; And these who, often drown\u2019d, could never die, Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars. One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun Ne\u2019er saw her match since first the world begun. BENVOLIO. Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, Herself pois\u2019d with herself in either eye: But in that crystal scales let there be weigh\u2019d Your lady\u2019s love against some other maid That I will show you shining at this feast, And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

By and by I come\u2014 To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send. ROMEO. So thrive my soul,\u2014 JULIET. A thousand times good night. [_Exit._] ROMEO. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, towards school with heavy looks. [_Retiring slowly._] Re-enter Juliet, above. JULIET. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer\u2019s voice To lure this tassel-gentle back again. Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of my Romeo\u2019s name. ROMEO. It is my soul that calls upon my name. How silver-sweet sound lovers\u2019 tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears. JULIET. Romeo. ROMEO. My nyas? JULIET. What o\u2019clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee? ROMEO. By the hour of nine. JULIET.", " [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._] FIRST MUSICIAN. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
