They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace Each humbly kiss\u2019d his knee, or hand, or face; He knows them all, in all such truth appears, E\u2019en he indulges the sweet joy of tears. BOOK XXIII. ARGUMENT. Euryclea awakens Penelope with the news of Ulysses\u2019 return, and the death of the suitors. Penelope scarcely credits her; but supposes some god has punished them, and descends from her department in doubt. At the first interview of Ulysses and Penelope, she is quite unsatisfied. Minerva restores him to the beauty of his youth; but the queen continues incredulous, till by some circumstances she is convinced, and falls into all the transports of passion and tenderness. They recount to each other all that has passed during their long separation. The next morning Ulysses, arming himself and his friends, goes from the city to visit his father. Then to the queen, as in repose she lay, The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way: The transports of her faithful heart supply A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly. \u201cAnd sleeps my child? (the reverend matron cries) Ulysses lives!", " After their attempts have proved ineffectual, Ulysses, taking Eumaeus and Philaetius apart, discovers himself to them; then returning, desires leave to try his strength at the bow, which, though refused with indignation by the suitors, Penelope and Telemachus cause it to be delivered to his hands. He bends it immediately, and shoots through all the rings. Jupiter at the same instant thunders from heaven; Ulysses accepts the omen, and gives a sign to Telemachus, who stands ready armed at his side. And Pallas now, to raise the rivals\u2019 fires, With her own art Penelope inspires Who now can bend Ulysses\u2019 bow, and wing The well-aim\u2019d arrow through the distant ring, Shall end the strife, and win the imperial dame: But discord and black death await the game! The prudent queen the lofty stair ascends: At distance due a virgin-train attends; A brazen key she held, the handle turn\u2019d, With steel and polish\u2019d elephant adorn\u2019d: Swift to the inmost room she bent her way, Where, safe reposed, the royal treasures lay: There shone high heap\u2019d the labour\u2019d brass and ore, And there the bow which great Ulysses bore; And there the quiver, where now guiltless slept Those winged deaths that many a matron wept. This gift, long since when Sparta\u2019s shore he trod, On young Ulysses Iphitus bestowed: Beneath Orsilochus\u2019 roof they met; One loss was private, one a public debt; Messena\u2019s state from Ithaca detains Three hundred sheep, and all the shepherd swains; And to the youthful prince to urge the laws, The king and elders trust their common cause.", " Stand forth, ye wrestlers, who these pastimes grace! I wield the gauntlet, and I run the race. In such heroic games I yield to none, Or yield to brave Laodamas alone: Shall I with brave Laodamas contend? A friend is sacred, and I style him friend. Ungenerous were the man, and base of heart, Who takes the kind, and pays the ungrateful part: Chiefly the man, in foreign realms confined, Base to his friend, to his own interest blind: All, all your heroes I this day defy; Give me a man that we our might may try. Expert in every art, I boast the skill To give the feather\u2019d arrow wings to kill; Should a whole host at once discharge the bow, My well-aim\u2019d shaft with death prevents the foe: Alone superior in the field of Troy, Great Philoctetes taught the shaft to fly. From all the sons of earth unrivall\u2019d praise I justly claim; but yield to better days, To those famed days when great Alcides rose, And Eurytus, who bade the gods be foes (Vain Eurytus, whose art became his crime, Swept from the earth, he perish\u2019d in his prime: Sudden the irremeable way he trod, Who boldly durst defy the bowyer god). In fighting fields as far the spear I throw As flies an arrow from the well-drawn bow.

Nor speak I rashly, but with faith averr\u2019d, And what I speak attesting Heaven has heard. If so, a cloak and vesture be my meed: Till his return no title shall I plead, Though certain be my news, and great my need. Whom want itself can force untruths to tell, My soul detests him as the gates of hell. \u201cThou first be witness, hospitable Jove! And every god inspiring social love! And witness every household power that waits, Guard of these fires, and angel of these gates! Ere the next moon increase or this decay, His ancient realms Ulysses shall survey, In blood and dust each proud oppressor mourn, And the lost glories of his house return.\u201d \u201cNor shall that meed be thine, nor ever more Shall loved Ulysses hail this happy shore. (Replied Eumaeus): to the present hour Now turn thy thought, and joys within our power. From sad reflection let my soul repose; The name of him awakes a thousand woes. But guard him, gods! and to these arms restore! Not his true consort can desire him more; Not old Laertes, broken with despair: Not young Telemachus, his blooming heir. Alas, Telemachus! my sorrows flow Afresh for thee, my second cause of woe! Like some fair plant set by a heavenly hand, He grew, he flourish\u2019d, and he bless\u2019d the land; In all the youth his father\u2019s image shined, Bright in his person, brighter in his mind. What man, or god, deceived his better sense, Far on the swelling seas to wander hence?", " Such end the wicked found! but Jove\u2019s intent Was yet to save the oppress\u2019d and innocent. Placed on the mast (the last resource of life) With winds and waves I held unequal strife: For nine long days the billows tilting o\u2019er, The tenth soft wafts me to Thesprotia\u2019s shore. The monarch\u2019s son a shipwreck\u2019d wretch relieved, The sire with hospitable rites received, And in his palace like a brother placed, With gifts of price and gorgeous garments graced While here I sojourn\u2019d, oft I heard the fame How late Ulysses to the country came. How loved, how honour\u2019d in this court he stay\u2019d, And here his whole collected treasure laid; I saw myself the vast unnumber\u2019d store Of steel elaborate, and refulgent ore, And brass high heap\u2019d amidst the regal dome; Immense supplies for ages yet to come! Meantime he voyaged to explore the will Of Jove, on high Dodona\u2019s holy hill, What means might best his safe return avail, To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail? Full oft has Phidon, whilst he pour\u2019d the wine, Attesting solemn all the powers divine, That soon Ulysses would return, declared The sailors waiting, and the ships prepared. But first the king dismiss\u2019d me from his shores, For fair Dulichium crown\u2019d with fruitful stores; To good Acastus\u2019 friendly care consign\u2019d: But other counsels pleased the sailors\u2019 mind: New frauds were plotted by the faithless train, And misery demands me once again. Soon as remote from shore they plough the wave, With ready hands they rush to seize their slave; Then with these tatter\u2019d rags they wrapp\u2019d me round (Stripp\u2019d of my own), and to the vessel bound.", " \u201cMy following fates to thee, O king, are known, And the bright partner of thy royal throne. Enough: in misery can words avail? And what so tedious as a twice-told tale?\u201d BOOK XIII. ARGUMENT. THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA. Ulysses takes his leave of Alcinous and Arete, and embarks in the evening. Next morning the ship arrives at Ithaca; where the sailors, as Ulysses is yet sleeping, lay him on the shore with all his treasures. On their return, Neptune changes their ship into a rock. In the meantime Ulysses, awaking, knows not his native Ithaca, by reason of a mist which Pallas had cast around him. He breaks into loud lamentations; till the goddess appearing to him in the form of a shepherd, discovers the country to him, and points out the particular places. He then tells a feigned story of his adventures, upon which she manifests herself, and they consult together of the measures to be taken to destroy the suitors. To conceal his return, and disguise his person the more effectually, she changes him into the figure of an old beggar. He ceased; but left so pleasing on their ear His voice, that listening still they seem\u2019d to hear. A pause of silence hush\u2019d the shady rooms: The grateful conference then the king resumes: \u201cWhatever toils the great Ulysses pass\u2019d, Beneath this happy roof they end at last; No longer now from shore to shore to roam, Smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home.", " On his bloomy face Youth smiled celestial, with each opening grace. He seized my hand, and gracious thus began: \u2018Ah whither roam\u2019st thou, much-enduring man? O blind to fate! what led thy steps to rove The horrid mazes of this magic grove? Each friend you seek in yon enclosure lies, All lost their form, and habitants of sties. Think\u2019st thou by wit to model their escape? Sooner shalt thou, a stranger to thy shape, Fall prone their equal: first thy danger know, Then take the antidote the gods bestow. The plant I give through all the direful bower Shall guard thee, and avert the evil hour. Now hear her wicked arts: Before thy eyes The bowl shall sparkle, and the banquet rise; Take this, nor from the faithless feast abstain, For temper\u2019d drugs and poison shall be vain. Soon as she strikes her wand, and gives the word, Draw forth and brandish thy refulgent sword, And menace death: those menaces shall move Her alter\u2019d mind to blandishment and love. Nor shun the blessing proffer\u2019d to thy arms, Ascend her bed, and taste celestial charms; So shall thy tedious toils a respite find, And thy lost friends return to human kind. But swear her first by those dread oaths that tie The powers below, the blessed in the sky; Lest to thee naked secret fraud be meant, Or magic bind thee cold and impotent. \u201cThus while he spoke, the sovereign plant he drew Where on the all-bearing earth unmark\u2019d it grew, And show\u2019d its nature and its wondrous power: Black was the root, but milky white the flower; Moly the name, to mortals hard to find, But all is easy to the ethereal kind."], "How does Athenadisguise herself to make preparations for Telemachus\u2019s journey?": [" The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the Island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. The man for wisdom\u2019s various arts renown\u2019d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray\u2019d, Their manners noted, and their states survey\u2019d, On stormy seas unnumber\u2019d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom\u2019d them never more (Ah, men unbless\u2019d!)", " To Pherae now, Diocleus\u2019 stately seat (Of Alpheus\u2019 race), the weary youths retreat. His house affords the hospitable rite, And pleased they sleep (the blessing of the night). But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, With rosy lustre purpled o\u2019er the lawn, Again they mount, their journey to renew, And from the sounding portico they flew. Along the waving fields their way they hold The fields receding as their chariot roll\u2019d; Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light, And o\u2019er the shaded landscape rush\u2019d the night. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS. Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably received by Menelaus to whom he relates the cause of his coming, and learns from him many particulars of what befell the Greeks since the destruction of Troy. He dwells more at large upon the prophecies of Proteus to him in his return; from which he acquaints Telemachus that Ulysses is detained in the island of Calypso. In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus on the voyage home. Penelope is apprised of this; but comforted in a dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Iphthima. And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds, Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds; At the fair dome the rapid labour ends; Where sate Atrides \u2019midst his bridal friends, With double vows invoking Hymen\u2019s power, To bless his son\u2019s and daughter\u2019s nuptial hour.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS. The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal\u2019d his eyes: Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress\u2019d, And all thy fortunes roll\u2019d within his breast.", " Nestor advises him to go to Sparta, and inquire further of Menelaus. The sacrifice ending with the night, Minerva vanishes from them in the form of an eagle: Telemachus is lodged in the palace. The next morning they sacrifice a bullock to Minerva; and Telemachus proceeds on his journey to Sparta, attended by Pisistratus. The scene lies on the sea-shore of Pylos. The sacred sun, above the waters raised, Through heaven\u2019s eternal brazen portals blazed; And wide o\u2019er earth diffused his cheering ray, To gods and men to give the golden day. Now on the coast of Pyle the vessel falls, Before old Neleus\u2019 venerable walls. There suppliant to the monarch of the flood, At nine green theatres the Pylians stood, Each held five hundred (a deputed train), At each, nine oxen on the sand lay slain. They taste the entrails, and the altars load With smoking thighs, an offering to the god. Full for the port the Ithacensians stand, And furl their sails, and issue on the land. Telemachus already press\u2019d the shore; Not first, the power of wisdom march\u2019d before, And ere the sacrificing throng he join\u2019d, Admonish\u2019d thus his well-attending mind: \u201cProceed, my son! this youthful shame expel; An honest business never blush to tell. To learn what fates thy wretched sire detain, We pass\u2019d the wide immeasurable main. Meet then the senior far renown\u2019d for sense With reverend awe, but decent confidence: Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies; And sure he will; for wisdom never lies.\u201d \u201cOh tell me, Mentor!"], "Who is Argos?": [" Of that heroic sire the youth is sprung, But modest awe hath chain\u2019d his timorous tongue. Thy voice, O king! with pleased attention heard, Is like the dictates of a god revered. With him, at Nestor\u2019s high command, I came, Whose age I honour with a parent\u2019s name. By adverse destiny constrained to sue For counsel and redress, he sues to you Whatever ill the friendless orphan bears, Bereaved of parents in his infant years, Still must the wrong\u2019d Telemachus sustain, If, hopeful of your aid, he hopes in vain; Affianced in your friendly power alone, The youth would vindicate the vacant throne.\u201d \u201cIs Sparta blest, and these desiring eyes View my friend\u2019s son? (the king exalting cries;) Son of my friend, by glorious toils approved, Whose sword was sacred to the man he loved; Mirror of constant faith, revered and mourn\u2019d\u2014 When Troy was ruin\u2019d, had the chief return\u2019d, No Greek an equal space had ere possess\u2019d, Of dear affection, in my grateful breast. I, to confirm the mutual joys we shared, For his abode a capital prepared; Argos, the seat of sovereign rule, I chose; Fair in the plan the future palace rose, Where my Ulysses and his race might reign, And portion to his tribes the wide domain, To them my vassals had resign\u2019d a soil, With teeming plenty to reward their toil. There with commutual zeal we both had strove In acts of dear benevolence and love: Brothers in peace, not rivals in command, And death alone dissolved the friendly band!", " Ill suits this courtly crew That stubborn horn which brave Ulysses drew. I well remember (for I gazed him o\u2019er While yet a child), what majesty he bore!

To speed the flying shaft through every ring, Wretch! is not thine: the arrows of the king Shall end those hopes, and fate is on the wing! Then thus Telemachus: \u201cSome god I find With pleasing frenzy has possess\u2019d my mind; When a loved mother threatens to depart, Why with this ill-timed gladness leaps my heart?

A trench he open\u2019d: in a line he placed. The level axes, and the points made fast (His perfect skill the wondering gazers eyed, The game as yet unseen, as yet untried).", " awful Nestor, tell How he, the mighty Agamemnon, fell; By what strange fraud Aegysthus wrought, relate (By force he could not) such a hero\u2019s fate?

Condemn\u2019d perhaps some foreign short to tread; Or sure Aegysthus had not dared the deed.\u201d To whom the full of days: Illustrious youth, Attend (though partly thou hast guess\u2019d) the truth. For had the martial Menelaus found The ruffian breathing yet on Argive ground; Nor earth had bid his carcase from the skies, Nor Grecian virgins shriek\u2019d his obsequies, But fowls obscene dismember\u2019d his remains, And dogs had torn him on the naked plains.

At first, with the worthy shame and decent pride, The royal dame his lawless suit denied. For virtue\u2019s image yet possess\u2019d her mind. Taught by a master of the tuneful kind; Atrides, parting for the Trojan war, Consign\u2019d the youthful consort to his care. True to his charge, the bard preserved her long In honour\u2019s limits; such the power of song. But when the gods these objects of their hate Dragg\u2019d to the destruction by the links of fate; The bard they banish\u2019d from his native soil, And left all helpless in a desert isle; There he, the sweetest of the sacred train, Sung dying to the rocks, but sung in vain.", " Thus saved from death, the gain\u2019d the Phaestan shores, With shatter\u2019d vessels and disabled oars; But five tall barks the winds and water toss\u2019d, Far from their fellows, on the Aegyptian coast.

Seven years, the traitor rich Mycenae sway\u2019d, And his stern rule the groaning land obey\u2019d; The eighth, from Athens to his realm restored, Orestes brandish\u2019d the avenging sword, Slew the dire pair, and gave to funeral flame The vile assassin and adulterous dame.

Hence warn\u2019d, my son, beware! nor idly stand Too long a stranger to thy native land; Lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away, While lawless feasters in thy palace away; Perhaps may seize thy realm, and share the spoil; And though return, with disappointed toil, From thy vain journey, to a rifled isle. However, my friend, indulge one labour more, And seek Atrides on the Spartan shore.

As some poor peasant, fated to reside Remote from neighbours in a forest wide, Studious to save what human wants require, In embers heap\u2019d, preserves the seeds of fire: Hid in dry foliage thus Ulysses lies, Till Pallas pour\u2019d soft slumbers on his eyes; And golden dreams (the gift of sweet repose) Lull\u2019d all his cares, and banish\u2019d all his woes. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. Pallas appearing in a dream in to Nausicaa (the daughter of Alcinous, king of Phaeacia, commands her to descend to the river, and wash the robes of state, in preparation for her nuptials. Nausicaa goes with her handmaidens to the river; where, while the garments are spread on the bank, they divert themselves in sports. Their voices awaken Ulysses, who, addressing himself to the princess, is by her relieved and clothed, and receives directions in what manner to apply to the king and queen of the island. While thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest, And peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast, The martial maid from heavens aerial height Swift to Phaeacia wing\u2019d her rapid flight, In elder times the soft Phaeacian train In ease possess\u2019d the wide Hyperian plain; Till the Cyclopean race in arms arose A lawless nation of gigantic foes; Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far, Through seas retreating from the sounds of war, The recreant nation to fair Scheria led, Where never science rear\u2019d her laurell\u2019d head; There round his tribes a strength of wall he raised; To heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed; Just to his realms, he parted grounds from grounds, And shared the lands, and gave the lands their bounds.", " Our sight the whole collected navy cheer\u2019d.

But the great god, whose thunder rends the skies, Averse, beholds the smoking sacrifice; And sees me wandering still from coast to coast, And all my vessels, all my people, lost! While thoughtless we indulge the genial rite, As plenteous cates and flowing bowls invite; Till evening Phoebus roll\u2019d away the light; Stretch\u2019d on the shore in careless ease we rest, Till ruddy morning purpled o\u2019er the east; Then from their anchors all our ships unbind, And mount the decks, and call the willing wind.

ARGUMENT. ADVENTURES WITH AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONS, AND CIRCE. Ulysses arrives at the island of AEolus, who gives him prosperous winds, and incloses the adverse ones in a bag, which his companions untying, they are driven back again and rejected. Then they sail to the Laestrygons, where they lose eleven ships, and, with only one remaining, proceed to the island of Circe. Eurylochus is sent first with some companions, all which, except Eurylochus, are transformed into swine.", " They scream, they shriek; and groans and dismal sounds Stun my scared ears, and pierce hell\u2019s utmost bounds.

ARGUMENT. THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS. He relates how, after his return from the shades, he was sent by Circe on his voyage, by the coast of the Sirens, and by the strait of Scylla and Charybdis: the manner in which he escaped those dangers: how, being cast on the island Trinacria, his companions destroyed the oxen of the Sun: the vengeance that followed; how all perished by shipwreck except himself, who, swimming on the mast of the ship, arrived on the island of Calypso. With which his narration concludes. \u201cThus o\u2019er the rolling surge the vessel flies, Till from the waves the AEaean hills arise. Here the gay Morn resides in radiant bowers, Here keeps here revels with the dancing Hours; Here Phoebus, rising in the ethereal way, Through heaven\u2019s bright portals pours the beamy day.", " Pallas, to these, deplores the unequal fates Of wise Ulysses and his toils relates: Her hero\u2019s danger touch\u2019d the pitying power, The nymph\u2019s seducements, and the magic bower. Thus she began her plaint: \u201cImmortal Jove! And you who fill the blissful seats above! Let kings no more with gentle mercy sway, Or bless a people willing to obey, But crush the nations with an iron rod, And every monarch be the scourge of God. If from your thoughts Ulysses you remove, Who ruled his subjects with a father\u2019s love, Sole in an isle, encircled by the main, Abandon\u2019d, banish\u2019d from his native reign, Unbless\u2019d he sighs, detained by lawless charms, And press\u2019d unwilling in Calypso\u2019s arms. Nor friends are there, nor vessels to convey, Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way. And now fierce traitors, studious to destroy His only son, their ambush\u2019d fraud employ; Who, pious, following his great father\u2019s fame, To sacred Pylos and to Sparta came.\u201d \u201cWhat words are these? (replied the power who forms The clouds of night, and darkens heaven with storms;) Is not already in thy soul decreed, The chief\u2019s return shall make the guilty bleed? What cannot Wisdom do? Thou may\u2019st restore The son in safety to his native shore; While the fell foes, who late in ambush lay, With fraud defeated measure back their way.\u201d Then thus to Hermes the command was given: \u201cHermes, thou chosen messenger of heaven! Go, to the nymph be these our orders borne \u2019Tis Jove\u2019s decree, Ulysses shall return: The patient man shall view his old abodes, Nor helped by mortal hand, nor guiding gods In twice ten days shall fertile Scheria find, Alone, and floating to the wave and wind."], "Who has an affairwith Eurymachus?": [" Before the flame Eurymachus now stands, And turns the bow, and chafes it with his hands Still the tough bow unmoved. The lofty man Sigh\u2019d from his mighty soul, and thus began: \u201cI mourn the common cause: for, oh, my friends, On me, on all, what grief, what shame attends! Not the lost nuptials can affect me more (For Greece has beauteous dames on every shore), But baffled thus! confess\u2019d so far below Ulysses\u2019 strength, as not to bend his bow! How shall all ages our attempt deride! Our weakness scorn!\u201d Antinous thus replied: \u201cNot so, Eurymachus: that no man draws The wondrous bow, attend another cause. Sacred to Phoebus is the solemn day, Which thoughtless we in games would waste away: Till the next dawn this ill-timed strife forego, And here leave fixed the ringlets in a row. Now bid the sewer approach, and let us join In due libations, and in rites divine, So end our night: before the day shall spring, The choicest offerings let Melanthius bring: Let then to Phoebus\u2019 name the fatted thighs Feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies. So shall the patron of these arts bestow (For his the gift) the skill to bend the bow.\u201d They heard well pleased: the ready heralds bring The cleansing waters from the limpid spring: The goblet high with rosy wine they crown\u2019d, In order circling to the peers around. That rite complete, uprose the thoughtful man, And thus his meditated scheme began: \u201cIf what I ask your noble minds approve, Ye peers and rivals in the royal love!", " Confused the suitors stood, From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood: Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide. Alone the bold Eurymachus replied: \u201cIf, as thy words import (he thus began), Ulysses lives, and thou the mighty man, Great are thy wrongs, and much hast thou sustain\u2019d In thy spoil\u2019d palace, and exhausted land; The cause and author of those guilty deeds, Lo! at thy feet unjust Antinous bleeds Not love, but wild ambition was his guide; To slay thy son, thy kingdom to divide, These were his aims; but juster Jove denied. Since cold in death the offender lies, oh spare Thy suppliant people, and receive their prayer! Brass, gold, and treasures, shall the spoil defray, Two hundred oxen every prince shall pay: The waste of years refunded in a day. Till then thy wrath is just.\u201d Ulysses burn\u2019d With high disdain, and sternly thus return\u2019d: \u201cAll, all the treasure that enrich\u2019d our throne Before your rapines, join\u2019d with all your own, If offer\u2019d, vainly should for mercy call; \u2019Tis you that offer, and I scorn them all; Your blood is my demand, your lives the prize, Till pale as yonder wretch each suitor lies. Hence with those coward terms; or fight or fly; This choice is left you, to resist or die: And die I trust ye shall.\u201d He sternly spoke: With guilty fears the pale assembly shook. Alone Eurymachus exhorts the train: \u201cYon archer, comrades, will not shoot in vain; But from the threshold shall his darts be sped, (Whoe\u2019er he be), till every prince lie dead?", " Oh! that as surely great Apollo\u2019s dart, Or some brave suitor\u2019s sword, might pierce the heart Of the proud son; as that we stand this hour In lasting safety from the father\u2019s power!\u201d So spoke the wretch, but, shunning farther fray, Turn\u2019d his proud step, and left them on their way. Straight to the feastful palace he repair\u2019d, Familiar enter\u2019d, and the banquet shared; Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord, He took his place, and plenty heap\u2019d the board. Meantime they heard, soft circling in the sky Sweet airs ascend, and heavenly minstrelsy (For Phemius to the lyre attuned the strain): Ulysses hearken\u2019d, then address\u2019d the swain: \u201cWell may this palace admiration claim, Great and respondent to the master\u2019s fame! Stage above stage the imperial structure stands, Holds the chief honours, and the town commands: High walls and battlements the courts inclose, And the strong gates defy a host of foes. Far other cares its dwellers now employ; The throng\u2019d assembly and the feast of joy: I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire, And hear (what graces every feast) the lyre.\u201d Then thus Eumaeus: \u201cJudge we which were best; Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest Choose you to mingle, while behind I stay? Or I first entering introduce the way? Wait for a space without, but wait not long; This is the house of violence and wrong: Some rude insult thy reverend age may bear; For like their lawless lords the servants are.\u201d \u201cJust is, O friend!", " Straight to the queen and palace shall I fly, Or yet more distant, to some lord apply?\u201d The prince return\u2019d: \u201cRenown\u2019d in days of yore Has stood our father\u2019s hospitable door; No other roof a stranger should receive, No other hands than ours the welcome give. But in my absence riot fills the place, Nor bears the modest queen a stranger\u2019s face; From noiseful revel far remote she flies, But rarely seen, or seen with weeping eyes. No\u2014let Eurymachus receive my guest, Of nature courteous, and by far the best; He woos the queen with more respectful flame, And emulates her former husband\u2019s fame, With what success, \u2019tis Jove\u2019s alone to know, And the hoped nuptials turn to joy or woe.\u201d Thus speaking, on the right up-soar\u2019d in air The hawk, Apollo\u2019s swift-wing\u2019d messenger: His dreadful pounces tore a trembling dove; The clotted feathers, scatter\u2019d from above, Between the hero and the vessel pour Thick plumage mingled with a sanguine shower. The observing augur took the prince aside, Seized by the hand, and thus prophetic cried: \u201cYon bird, that dexter cuts the aerial road, Rose ominous, nor flies without a god: No race but thine shall Ithaca obey, To thine, for ages, Heaven decrees the sway.\u201d \u201cSucceed the omens, gods! (the youth rejoin\u2019d:) Soon shall my bounties speak a grateful mind, And soon each envied happiness attend The man who calls Telemachus his friend.\u201d Then to Peiraeus: \u201cThou whom time has proved A faithful servant, by thy prince beloved!"], "Menelaus is kingof which city?": [" There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS. The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal\u2019d his eyes: Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress\u2019d, And all thy fortunes roll\u2019d within his breast.", " To Pherae now, Diocleus\u2019 stately seat (Of Alpheus\u2019 race), the weary youths retreat. His house affords the hospitable rite, And pleased they sleep (the blessing of the night). But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, With rosy lustre purpled o\u2019er the lawn, Again they mount, their journey to renew, And from the sounding portico they flew. Along the waving fields their way they hold The fields receding as their chariot roll\u2019d; Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light, And o\u2019er the shaded landscape rush\u2019d the night. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS. Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably received by Menelaus to whom he relates the cause of his coming, and learns from him many particulars of what befell the Greeks since the destruction of Troy. He dwells more at large upon the prophecies of Proteus to him in his return; from which he acquaints Telemachus that Ulysses is detained in the island of Calypso. In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus on the voyage home. Penelope is apprised of this; but comforted in a dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Iphthima. And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds, Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds; At the fair dome the rapid labour ends; Where sate Atrides \u2019midst his bridal friends, With double vows invoking Hymen\u2019s power, To bless his son\u2019s and daughter\u2019s nuptial hour.", " awful Nestor, tell How he, the mighty Agamemnon, fell; By what strange fraud Aegysthus wrought, relate (By force he could not) such a hero\u2019s fate? Live Menelaus not in Greece? or where Was then the martial brother\u2019s pious care? Condemn\u2019d perhaps some foreign short to tread; Or sure Aegysthus had not dared the deed.\u201d To whom the full of days: Illustrious youth, Attend (though partly thou hast guess\u2019d) the truth. For had the martial Menelaus found The ruffian breathing yet on Argive ground; Nor earth had bid his carcase from the skies, Nor Grecian virgins shriek\u2019d his obsequies, But fowls obscene dismember\u2019d his remains, And dogs had torn him on the naked plains. While us the works of bloody Mars employ\u2019d, The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoy\u2019d: He stretch\u2019d at ease in Argos\u2019 calm recess (Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless), With flattery\u2019s insinuating art Soothed the frail queen, and poison\u2019d all her heard. At first, with the worthy shame and decent pride, The royal dame his lawless suit denied. For virtue\u2019s image yet possess\u2019d her mind. Taught by a master of the tuneful kind; Atrides, parting for the Trojan war, Consign\u2019d the youthful consort to his care. True to his charge, the bard preserved her long In honour\u2019s limits; such the power of song. But when the gods these objects of their hate Dragg\u2019d to the destruction by the links of fate; The bard they banish\u2019d from his native soil, And left all helpless in a desert isle; There he, the sweetest of the sacred train, Sung dying to the rocks, but sung in vain.", " To these the cause of meeting they explain, And Menelaus moves to cross the main; Not so the king of men: be will\u2019d to stay, The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay, And calm Minerva\u2019s wrath. Oh blind to fate! The gods not lightly change their love, or hate. With ireful taunts each other they oppose, Till in loud tumult all the Greeks arose. Now different counsels every breast divide, Each burns with rancour to the adverse side; The unquiet night strange projects entertain\u2019d (So Jove, that urged us to our fate, ordain\u2019d). We with the rising morn our ships unmoor\u2019d, And brought our captives and our stores aboard; But half the people with respect obey\u2019d The king of men, and at his bidding stay\u2019d. Now on the wings of winds our course we keep (For God had smooth\u2019d the waters of the deep); For Tenedos we spread our eager oars, There land, and pay due victims to the powers; To bless our safe return, we join in prayer; But angry Jove dispersed our vows in air, And raised new discord. Then (so Heaven decreed) Ulysses first and Neator disagreed! Wise as he was, by various counsels away\u2019d, He there, though late, to please the monarch, stay\u2019d. But I, determined, stem the foamy floods, Warn\u2019d of the coming fury of the gods. With us, Tydides fear\u2019d, and urged his haste: And Menelaus came, but came the last, He join\u2019d our vessels in the Lesbian bay, While yet we doubted of our watery way; If to the right to urge the pilot\u2019s toil (The safer road), beside the Psyrian isle; Or the straight course to rocky Chios plough, And anchor under Mimas\u2019 shaggy brow?"], "Eurycleia recognizesOdysseus based on what distinguishing feature?": [" Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the Homeric age; however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age; however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics:\u2014still it is difficult to suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram. \u201cIf, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times, the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part.", " And now Eumaeus, at the evening hour, Came late, returning to his sylvan bower. Ulysses and his son had dress\u2019d with art A yearling boar, and gave the gods their part. Holy repast! That instant from the skies The martial goddess to Ulysses flies: She waves her golden wand, and reassumes From every feature every grace that blooms; At once his vestures change; at once she sheds Age o\u2019er his limbs, that tremble as he treads: Lest to the queen the swain with transport fly, Unable to contain the unruly joy; When near he drew, the prince breaks forth: \u201cProclaim What tidings, friend? what speaks the voice of fame? Say, if the suitors measure back the main, Or still in ambush thirst for blood in vain?\u201d \u201cWhether (he cries) they measure back the flood, Or still in ambush thirst in vain for blood, Escaped my care: where lawless suitors sway, Thy mandate borne my soul disdain\u2019d to stay. But from the Hermaean height I cast a view, Where to the port a bark high-bounding flew; Her freight a shining band: with martial air Each poised his shield, and each advanced his spear; And, if aright these searching eyes survey, The eluded suitors stem the watery way.\u201d The prince, well pleased to disappoint their wiles, Steals on his sire a glance, and secret smiles. And now, a short repast prepared, they fed Till the keen rage of craving hunger fled: Then to repose withdrawn, apart they lay, And in soft sleep forgot the cares of day.", " At the cool cave arrived, they took their state; He filled the throne where Mercury had sate. For him the nymph a rich repast ordains, Such as the mortal life of man sustains; Before herself were placed the the cates divine, Ambrosial banquet and celestial wine. Their hunger satiate, and their thirst repress\u2019d, Thus spoke Calypso to her godlike guest: \u201cUlysses! (with a sigh she thus began;) O sprung from gods! in wisdom more than man! Is then thy home the passion of thy heart? Thus wilt thou leave me, are we thus to part? Farewell! and ever joyful mayst thou be, Nor break the transport with one thought of me. But ah, Ulysses! wert thou given to know What Fate yet dooms these still to undergo, Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease. And e\u2019en these slighted charms might learn to please. A willing goddess, and immortal life. Might banish from thy mind an absent wife. Am I inferior to a mortal dame? Less soft my feature less august my frame? Or shall the daughters of mankind compare Their earth born beauties with the heavenly fair?\u201d \u201cAlas! for this (the prudent man replies) Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise? Loved and adored, O goddess as thou art, Forgive the weakness of a human heart. Though well I see thy graces far above The dear, though mortal, object of my love, Of youth eternal well the difference know, And the short date of fading charms below; Yet every day, while absent thus I roam, I languish to return and die at home.", " Meanwhile Minerva with instinctive fires Thy soul, Penelope, from Heaven inspires; With flattering hopes the suitors to betray, And seem to meet, yet fly, the bridal day: Thy husband\u2019s wonder, and thy son\u2019s to raise; And crown the mother and the wife with praise. Then, while the streaming sorrow dims her eyes, Thus, with a transient smile, the matron cries: \u201cEurynome! to go where riot reigns I feel an impulse, though my soul disdains; To my loved son the snares of death to show, And in the traitor friend, unmask the foe; Who, smooth of tongue, in purpose insincere, Hides fraud in smiles, while death is ambush\u2019d there.\u201d \u201cGo, warn thy son, nor be the warning vain (Replied the sagest of the royal train); But bathed, anointed, and adorn\u2019d, descend; Powerful of charms, bid every grace attend; The tide of flowing tears awhile suppress; Tears but indulge the sorrow, not repress. Some joy remains: to thee a son is given, Such as, in fondness, parents ask of Heaven.\u201d \u201cAh me! forbear!\u201d returns the queen, \u201cforbear, Oh! talk not, talk not of vain beauty\u2019s care; No more I bathe, since he no longer sees Those charms, for whom alone I wish to please. The day that bore Ulysses from this coast Blasted the little bloom these cheeks could boast. But instant bid Autonoe descend, Instant Hippodame our steps attend; Ill suits it female virtue, to be seen Alone, indecent, in the walks of men.\u201d Then while Eurynome the mandate bears, From heaven Minerva shoots with guardian cares; O\u2019er all her senses, as the couch she press\u2019d, She pours, a pleasing, deep and death-like rest, With every beauty every feature arms, Bids her cheeks glow, and lights up all her charms; In her love-darting eyes awakes the fires (Immortal gifts!"], "How is Odysseusable to listen safely to the Sirens\u2019 song?": [" In feasts we waste the day, Till Phoebus downward plunged his burning ray; Then sable night ascends, and balmy rest Seals every eye, and calms the troubled breast.

Unblest the man, whom music wins to stay Nigh the cursed shore and listen to the lay. No more that wretch shall view the joys of life His blooming offspring, or his beauteous wife! In verdant meads they sport; and wide around Lie human bones that whiten all the ground: The ground polluted floats with human gore, And human carnage taints the dreadful shore Fly swift the dangerous coast: let every ear Be stopp\u2019d against the song! \u2019tis death to hear!

Then, fired by all the Muse, aloud he sings The mighty deeds of demigods and kings; From that fierce wrath the noble song arose, That made Ulysses and Achilles foes; How o\u2019er the feast they doom the fall of Troy; The stern debate Atrides hears with joy; For Heaven foretold the contest, when he trod The marble threshold of the Delphic god, Curious to learn the counsels of the sky, Ere yet he loosed the rage of war on Troy. Touch\u2019d at the song, Ulysses straight resign\u2019d To soft affliction all his manly mind. Before his eyes the purple vest he drew, Industrious to conceal the falling dew; But when the music paused, he ceased to shed The flowing tear, and raised his drooping head; And, lifting to the gods a goblet crown\u2019d, He pour\u2019d a pure libation to the ground. Transported with the song, the listening train Again with loud applause demand the strain; Again Ulysses veil\u2019d his pensive head. Again unmann\u2019d, a shower of sorrows shed; Conceal\u2019d he wept; the king observed alone The silent tear, and heard the secret groan; Then to the bard aloud\u2014\u201cO cease to sing, Dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string; Enough the feast has pleased, enough the power Of heavenly song has crown\u2019d the genial hour!

The ductile wax with busy hands I mould, And cleft in fragments, and the fragments roll\u2019d; The aerial region now grew warm with day, The wax dissolved beneath the burning ray; Then every ear I barr\u2019d against the strain, And from access of frenzy lock\u2019d the brain. Now round the masts my mates the fetters roll\u2019d, And bound me limb by limb with fold on fold. Then bending to the stroke, the active train Plunge all at once their oars, and cleave the main. \u201cWhile to the shore the rapid vessel flies, Our swift approach the Siren choir descries; Celestial music warbles from their tongue, And thus the sweet deluders tune the song: \u201c\u2018Oh stay, O pride of Greece!

If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simenides of Amorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music\u2014the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people, as well as a thirst for new poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer.", " Pallas, unconquer\u2019d maid, my frame surrounds With grace divine: her power admits no bounds; She o\u2019er my limbs old age and wrinkles shed; Now strong as youth, magnificent I tread.

So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject: let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim. At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that \u201cHomer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about Peisistratus\u2019 time, about five hundred years after.\u201d Two French writers\u2014Hedelin and Perrault\u2014avowed a similar scepticism on the subject; but it is in the \u201cScienza Nuova\u201d of Battista Vico, that we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:\u2014 \u201cHalf a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf, turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the Homeric text.", " That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim In distant regions the Phaeacian fame: None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway, Or swifter in the race devour the way; None in the leap spring with so strong a bound, Or firmer, in the wrestling, press the ground.\u201d Thus spoke the king; the attending peers obey; In state they move, Alcinous lends the way; His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung, High on a column in the palace hung; And guided by a herald\u2019s guardian cares, Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs.

With these came forth Ambasineus the strong: And three brave sons, from great Alcinous sprung. Ranged in a line the ready racers stand, Start from the goal, and vanish o\u2019er the strand: Swift as on wings of winds, upborne they fly, And drifts of rising dust involve the sky.

The king himself initiates to the power: Scatters with quivering hand the sacred flour, And the stream sprinkles; from the curling brows The hair collected in the fire he throws. Soon as due vows on every part were paid, And sacred wheat upon the victim laid, Strong Thrasymed discharged the speeding blow Full on his neck, and cut the nerves in two. Down sunk the heavy beast; the females round Maids, wives, and matrons, mix a shrilling sound.

As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf\u2019s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning. \u201cTo me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are nowise admissible.", " The creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.\u201d From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer an individual? or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets? Well has Landor remarked: \u201cSome tell us there were twenty Homers; some deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.\u201d But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysis, our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry details.", " There seems, therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old epics,\u2014the Thebais and the Cypria, as well as the Iliad and the Odyssey,\u2014began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century B.C. I; and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it: so that before the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodies.\u201d But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations:\u2014 \u201cThere are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion, throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid compilation, at least over the theory that the Iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the fame, and the faint echo; if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain.", " If true, if faithful thou, her grateful mind Of decent robes a present has design\u2019d: So finding favour in the royal eye, Thy other wants her subjects shall supply.\u201d \u201cFair truth alone (the patient man replied) My words shall dictate, and my lips shall guide.

Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon.", " BOOK VII.

Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Sprinkled with roseate light the dewy lawn, In haste the prince arose, prepared to part; His hand impatient grasps the pointed dart; Fair on his feet the polish\u2019d sandals shine, And thus he greets the master of the swine: \u201cMy friend, adieu! let this short stay suffice; I haste to meet my mother\u2019s longing eyes, And end her tears, her sorrows and her sighs.

In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus on the voyage home. Penelope is apprised of this; but comforted in a dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Iphthima. And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds, Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds; At the fair dome the rapid labour ends; Where sate Atrides \u2019midst his bridal friends, With double vows invoking Hymen\u2019s power, To bless his son\u2019s and daughter\u2019s nuptial hour.", " Ill I deserved these haughty peers\u2019 disdain; Now let them comfort their dejected train, In sweet repast their present hour employ, Nor wait till evening for the genial joy: Then to the lute\u2019s soft voice prolong the night; Music, the banquet\u2019s most refined delight.\u201d He said, then gave a nod; and at the word Telemachus girds on his shining sword.

Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy. Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver\u2019d deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew: \u201cOne venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes! yet remains to play; Another mark our arrow must attain.

The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care.

There appears a prodigy of two eagles in the sky, which an augur expounds to the ruin of the suitors. Telemachus then demands a vessel to carry him to Pylos and Sparta, there to inquire of his father\u2019s fortunes. Pallas, in the shape of Mentor (an ancient friend of Ulysses), helps him to a ship, assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage, and embarks with him that night; which concludes the second day from the opening of the poem. The scene continues in the palace of Ulysses, in Ithaca. Now reddening from the dawn, the morning ray Glow\u2019d in the front of heaven, and gave the day The youthful hero, with returning light, Rose anxious from the inquietudes of night. A royal robe he wore with graceful pride, A two-edged falchion threaten\u2019d by his side, Embroider\u2019d sandals glitter\u2019d as he trod, And forth he moved, majestic as a god. Then by his heralds, restless of delay, To council calls the peers: the peers obey. Soon as in solemn form the assembly sate, From his high dome himself descends in state. Bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined; Two dogs, a faithful guard, attend behind; Pallas with grace divine his form improves, And gazing crowds admire him as he moves, His father\u2019s throne he fill\u2019d; while distant stood The hoary peers, and aged wisdom bow\u2019d.", " The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times.

Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is shipwrecked, and in the last danger of death; till Lencothea, a sea-goddess, assists him, and, after innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phaeacia.

He had now remained seven years in the Island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. The man for wisdom\u2019s various arts renown\u2019d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray\u2019d, Their manners noted, and their states survey\u2019d, On stormy seas unnumber\u2019d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom\u2019d them never more (Ah, men unbless\u2019d!)"], "What did Ajaxdo to bring disaster upon the homecoming Greek fleet?": [" Once more the palace set in fair array, To the base court the females take their way; There compass\u2019d close between the dome and wall (Their life\u2019s last scene) they trembling wait their fall. Then thus the prince: \u201cTo these shall we afford A fate so pure as by the martial sword? To these, the nightly prostitutes to shame, And base revilers of our house and name?\u201d Thus speaking, on the circling wall he strung A ship\u2019s tough cable from a column hung; Near the high top he strain\u2019d it strongly round, Whence no contending foot could reach the ground. Their heads above connected in a row, They beat the air with quivering feet below: Thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare, The doves or thrushes flap their wings in air. Soon fled the soul impure, and left behind The empty corse to waver with the wind. Then forth they led Melanthius, and began Their bloody work; they lopp\u2019d away the man, Morsel for dogs! then trimm\u2019d with brazen shears The wretch, and shorten\u2019d of his nose and ears; His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel: He roar\u2019d, and torments gave his soul to hell. They wash, and to Ulysses take their way: So ends the bloody business of the day. To Euryclea then address\u2019d the king: (\u201cBring hither fire, and hither sulphur bring, To purge the palace: then the queen attend, And let her with her matron-train descend; The matron-train, with all the virgin-band, Assemble here, to learn their lord\u2019s command.\u201d Then Euryclea: \u201cJoyful I obey, But cast those mean dishonest rags away; Permit me first the royal robes to bring: Ill suits this garb the shoulders of a king.\u201d \u201cBring sulphur straight, and fire\u201d (the monarch cries).", " Do public or domestic care constrain This toilsome voyage o\u2019er the surgy main?\u201d \u201cO highly-flavour\u2019d delegate of Jove!

But prostrate I implore, O king! relate The mournful series of my father\u2019s fate: Each known disaster of the man disclose, Born by his mother to a world of woes! Recite them; nor in erring pity fear To wound with storied grief the filial ear. If e\u2019er Ulysses, to reclaim your right, Avow\u2019d his zeal in council or in fight, If Phrygian camps the friendly toils attest, To the sire\u2019s merit give the son\u2019s request.\u201d Deep from his inmost soul Atrides sigh\u2019d, And thus, indignant, to the prince replied: \u201cHeavens! would a soft, inglorious, dastard train An absent hero\u2019s nuptial joys profane! So with her young, amid the woodland shades, A timorous hind the lion\u2019s court invades, Leaves in the fatal lair the tender fawns, Climbs the green cliff, or feeds the flowery lawns: Meantime return\u2019d, with dire remorseless sway, The monarch-savage rends the trembling prey. With equal fury, and with equal fame, Ulysses soon shall reassert his claim.", " \u201c\u2018High o\u2019er the main two rocks exalt their brow,\u2019 The boiling billows thundering roll below; Through the vast waves the dreadful wonders move, Hence named Erratic by the gods above. No bird of air, no dove of swiftest wing, That bears ambrosia to the ethereal king, Shuns the dire rocks: in vain she cuts the skies; The dire rocks meet, and crush her as she flies: Not the fleet bark, when prosperous breezes play, Ploughs o\u2019er that roaring surge its desperate way; O\u2019erwhelm\u2019d it sinks: while round a smoke expires, And the waves flashing seem to burn with fires. Scarce the famed Argo pass\u2019d these raging floods, The sacred Argo, fill\u2019d with demigods! E\u2019en she had sunk, but Jove\u2019s imperial bride Wing\u2019d her fleet sail, and push\u2019d her o\u2019er the tide. \u201c\u2018High in the air the rock its summit shrouds In brooding tempests, and in rolling clouds; Loud storms around, and mists eternal rise, Beat its bleak brow, and intercept the skies. When all the broad expansion, bright with day, Glows with the autumnal or the summer ray, The summer and the autumn glow in vain, The sky for ever lowers, for ever clouds remain. Impervious to the step of man it stands, Though borne by twenty feet, though arm\u2019d with twenty hands; Smooth as the polish of the mirror rise The slippery sides, and shoot into the skies. Full in the centre of this rock display\u2019d, A yawning cavern casts a dreadful shade: Nor the fleet arrow from the twanging bow, Sent with full force, could reach the depth below.", " Thus sung the bard: Ulysses hears with joy, And loud applauses read the vaulted sky. Then to the sports his sons the king commands, Each blooming youth before the monarch stands, In dance unmatch\u2019d! A wondrous ball is brought (The work of Polypus, divinely wrought); This youth with strength enormous bids it fly, And bending backward whirls it to the sky; His brother, springing with an active bound, At distance intercepts it from the ground. The ball dismissed, in dance they skim the strand, Turn and return, and scarce imprint the sand. The assembly gazes with astonished eyes, And sends in shouts applauses to the skies. Then thus Ulysses: \u201cHappy king, whose name The brightest shines in all the rolls of fame! In subjects happy with surprise I gaze; Thy praise was just; their skill transcends thy praise.\u201d Pleas\u2019d with his people\u2019s fame, the monarch hears, And thus benevolent accosts the peers: \u201cSince wisdom\u2019s sacred guidance he pursues, Give to the stranger-guest a stranger\u2019s dues: Twelve princes in our realm dominion share, O\u2019er whom supreme, imperial power I bear; Bring gold, a pledge of love: a talent bring, A vest, a robe, and imitate your king. Be swift to give: that he this night may share The social feast of joy, with joy sincere. And thou, Euryalus, redeem thy wrong; A generous heart repairs a slanderous tongue.\u201d The assenting peers, obedient to the king, In haste their heralds send the gifts to bring."], "What gift doesTelemachus accept from Menelaus?": [" There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.

The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal\u2019d his eyes: Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress\u2019d, And all thy fortunes roll\u2019d within his breast.", " To Pherae now, Diocleus\u2019 stately seat (Of Alpheus\u2019 race), the weary youths retreat. His house affords the hospitable rite, And pleased they sleep (the blessing of the night). But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, With rosy lustre purpled o\u2019er the lawn, Again they mount, their journey to renew, And from the sounding portico they flew. Along the waving fields their way they hold The fields receding as their chariot roll\u2019d; Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light, And o\u2019er the shaded landscape rush\u2019d the night. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS. Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably received by Menelaus to whom he relates the cause of his coming, and learns from him many particulars of what befell the Greeks since the destruction of Troy. He dwells more at large upon the prophecies of Proteus to him in his return; from which he acquaints Telemachus that Ulysses is detained in the island of Calypso. In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus on the voyage home. Penelope is apprised of this; but comforted in a dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Iphthima. And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds, Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds; At the fair dome the rapid labour ends; Where sate Atrides \u2019midst his bridal friends, With double vows invoking Hymen\u2019s power, To bless his son\u2019s and daughter\u2019s nuptial hour.", " awful Nestor, tell How he, the mighty Agamemnon, fell; By what strange fraud Aegysthus wrought, relate (By force he could not) such a hero\u2019s fate? Live Menelaus not in Greece? or where Was then the martial brother\u2019s pious care? Condemn\u2019d perhaps some foreign short to tread; Or sure Aegysthus had not dared the deed.\u201d To whom the full of days: Illustrious youth, Attend (though partly thou hast guess\u2019d) the truth. For had the martial Menelaus found The ruffian breathing yet on Argive ground; Nor earth had bid his carcase from the skies, Nor Grecian virgins shriek\u2019d his obsequies, But fowls obscene dismember\u2019d his remains, And dogs had torn him on the naked plains. While us the works of bloody Mars employ\u2019d, The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoy\u2019d: He stretch\u2019d at ease in Argos\u2019 calm recess (Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless), With flattery\u2019s insinuating art Soothed the frail queen, and poison\u2019d all her heard. At first, with the worthy shame and decent pride, The royal dame his lawless suit denied. For virtue\u2019s image yet possess\u2019d her mind. Taught by a master of the tuneful kind; Atrides, parting for the Trojan war, Consign\u2019d the youthful consort to his care. True to his charge, the bard preserved her long In honour\u2019s limits; such the power of song. But when the gods these objects of their hate Dragg\u2019d to the destruction by the links of fate; The bard they banish\u2019d from his native soil, And left all helpless in a desert isle; There he, the sweetest of the sacred train, Sung dying to the rocks, but sung in vain.", " To these the cause of meeting they explain, And Menelaus moves to cross the main; Not so the king of men: be will\u2019d to stay, The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay, And calm Minerva\u2019s wrath. Oh blind to fate! The gods not lightly change their love, or hate. With ireful taunts each other they oppose, Till in loud tumult all the Greeks arose. Now different counsels every breast divide, Each burns with rancour to the adverse side; The unquiet night strange projects entertain\u2019d (So Jove, that urged us to our fate, ordain\u2019d). We with the rising morn our ships unmoor\u2019d, And brought our captives and our stores aboard; But half the people with respect obey\u2019d The king of men, and at his bidding stay\u2019d. Now on the wings of winds our course we keep (For God had smooth\u2019d the waters of the deep); For Tenedos we spread our eager oars, There land, and pay due victims to the powers; To bless our safe return, we join in prayer; But angry Jove dispersed our vows in air, And raised new discord. Then (so Heaven decreed) Ulysses first and Neator disagreed! Wise as he was, by various counsels away\u2019d, He there, though late, to please the monarch, stay\u2019d. But I, determined, stem the foamy floods, Warn\u2019d of the coming fury of the gods. With us, Tydides fear\u2019d, and urged his haste: And Menelaus came, but came the last, He join\u2019d our vessels in the Lesbian bay, While yet we doubted of our watery way; If to the right to urge the pilot\u2019s toil (The safer road), beside the Psyrian isle; Or the straight course to rocky Chios plough, And anchor under Mimas\u2019 shaggy brow?"], "How long doesOdysseus spend on Calypso\u2019s island?": [" The queen awakes, deliver\u2019d of her woes; With florid joy her heart dilating glows: The vision, manifest of future fate, Makes her with hope her son\u2019s arrival wait.

For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. The man for wisdom\u2019s various arts renown\u2019d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray\u2019d, Their manners noted, and their states survey\u2019d, On stormy seas unnumber\u2019d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom\u2019d them never more (Ah, men unbless\u2019d!)", " They scream, they shriek; and groans and dismal sounds Stun my scared ears, and pierce hell\u2019s utmost bounds. No more my heart the dismal din sustains, And my cold blood hangs shivering in my veins; Lest Gorgon, rising from the infernal lakes, With horrors arm\u2019d, and curls of hissing snakes, Should fix me stiffen\u2019d at the monstrous sight, A stony image, in eternal night! Straight from the direful coast to purer air I speed my flight, and to my mates repair. My mates ascend the ship; they strike their oars; The mountains lessen, and retreat the shores; Swift o\u2019er the waves we fly; the freshening gales Sing through the shrouds, and stretch the swelling sails.\u201d BOOK XII. ARGUMENT. THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS. He relates how, after his return from the shades, he was sent by Circe on his voyage, by the coast of the Sirens, and by the strait of Scylla and Charybdis: the manner in which he escaped those dangers: how, being cast on the island Trinacria, his companions destroyed the oxen of the Sun: the vengeance that followed; how all perished by shipwreck except himself, who, swimming on the mast of the ship, arrived on the island of Calypso. With which his narration concludes. \u201cThus o\u2019er the rolling surge the vessel flies, Till from the waves the AEaean hills arise. Here the gay Morn resides in radiant bowers, Here keeps here revels with the dancing Hours; Here Phoebus, rising in the ethereal way, Through heaven\u2019s bright portals pours the beamy day.", " The queen, an nearer view, the guest survey\u2019d, Rob\u2019d in the garments her own hands had made, Not without wonder seen. Then thus began, Her words addressing to the godlike man: \u201cCamest thou hither, wondrous stranger I say, From lands remote and o\u2019er a length of sea? Tell, then, whence art thou? whence, that princely air? And robes like these, so recent and so fair?\u201d \u201cHard is the task, O princess! you impose (Thus sighing spoke the man of many woes), The long, the mournful series to relate Of all my sorrows sent by Heaven and Fate! Yet what you ask, attend. An island lies Beyond these tracts, and under other skies, Ogygia named, in Ocean\u2019s watery arms; Where dwells Calypso, dreadful in her charms! Remote from gods or men she holds her reign, Amid the terrors of a rolling main. Me, only me, the hand of fortune bore, Unblest! to tread that interdicted shore: When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps Launch\u2019d his red lightning at our scattered ships; Then, all my fleet and all my followers lost. Sole on a plank on boiling surges toss\u2019d, Heaven drove my wreck the Ogygian Isle to find, Full nine days floating to the wave and wind. Met by the goddess there with open arms, She bribed my stay with more than human charms; Nay, promised, vainly promised, to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe; But all her blandishments successless prove, To banish from my breast my country\u2019s love. I stay reluctant seven continued years, And water her ambrosial couch with tears, The eighth she voluntary moves to part, Or urged by Jove, or her own changeful heart."], "Who is considered the only decent suitor?": [" But if submissive you resign the sway, Slaves to a boy, go, flatter and obey. Retire we instant to our native reign, Nor be the wealth of kings consumed in vain; Then wed whom choice approves: the queen be given To some blest prince, the prince decreed by Heaven.\u201d Abash\u2019d, the suitor train his voice attends; Till from his throne Amphinomus ascends, Who o\u2019er Dulichium stretch\u2019d his spacious reign, A land of plenty, bless\u2019d with every grain: Chief of the numbers who the queen address\u2019d, And though displeasing, yet displeasing least. Soft were his words; his actions wisdom sway\u2019d; Graceful awhile he paused, then mildly said: \u201cO friends, forbear! and be the thought withstood: \u2019Tis horrible to shed imperial blood! Consult we first the all-seeing powers above, And the sure oracles of righteous Jove. If they assent, e\u2019en by this hand he dies; If they forbid, I war not with the skies.\u201d He said: the rival train his voice approved, And rising instant to the palace moved. Arrived, with wild tumultuous noise they sate, Recumbent on the shining thrones of state. The Medon, conscious of their dire debates, The murderous counsel to the queen relates. Touch\u2019d at the dreadful story, she descends: Her hasty steps a damsel train attends. Full where the dome its shining valves expands, Sudden before the rival powers she stands; And, veiling, decent, with a modest shade Her cheek, indignant to Antinous said: \u201cO void of faith!", " Should second love a pleasing flame inspire, And the chaste queen connubial rights require; Dismiss\u2019d with honour, let her hence repair To great Icarius, whose paternal care Will guide her passion, and reward her choice With wealthy dower, and bridal gifts of price.

Direct your toil Through the wide ocean first to sandy Pyle; Of Nestor, hoary sage, his doom demand: Thence speed your voyage to the Spartan strand; For young Atrides to the Achaian coast Arrived the last of all the victor host. If yet Ulysses views the light, forbear, Till the fleet hours restore the circling year. But if his soul hath wing\u2019d the destined flight, Inhabitant of deep disastrous night; Homeward with pious speed repass the main, To the pale shade funereal rites ordain, Plant the fair column o\u2019er the vacant grave, A hero\u2019s honours let the hero have. With decent grief the royal dead deplored, For the chaste queen select an equal lord. Then let revenge your daring mind employ, By fraud or force the suitor train destroy, And starting into manhood, scorn the boy. Hast thou not heard how young Orestes, fired With great revenge, immortal praise acquired? His virgin-sword AEgysthus\u2019 veins imbrued; The murderer fell, and blood atoned for blood.", " If true, if faithful thou, her grateful mind Of decent robes a present has design\u2019d: So finding favour in the royal eye, Thy other wants her subjects shall supply.\u201d \u201cFair truth alone (the patient man replied) My words shall dictate, and my lips shall guide. To him, to me, one common lot was given, In equal woes, alas! involved by Heaven. Much of his fates I know; but check\u2019d by fear I stand; the hand of violence is here: Here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade, And injured suppliants seek in vain for aid. Let for a space the pensive queen attend, Nor claim my story till the sun descend; Then in such robes as suppliants may require, Composed and cheerful by the genial fire, When loud uproar and lawless riot cease, Shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace.\u201d Swift to the queen returns the gentle swain: \u201cAnd say (she cries), does fear or shame detain The cautious stranger? With the begging kind Shame suits but ill.\u201d Eumaeus thus rejoin\u2019d: \u201cHe only asks a more propitious hour, And shuns (who would not?) wicked men in power; At evening mild (meet season to confer) By turns to question, and by turns to hear.\u201d \u201cWhoe\u2019er this guest (the prudent queen replies) His every step and every thought is wise. For men like these on earth he shall not find In all the miscreant race of human kind.\u201d Thus she. Eumaeus all her words attends, And, parting, to the suitor powers descends; There seeks Telemachus, and thus apart In whispers breathes the fondness of his heart: \u201cThe time, my lord, invites me to repair Hence to the lodge; my charge demands my care.", " A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf\u2019s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning. \u201cTo me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are nowise admissible."], "Which god/goddess is most responsible for helping Odysseus and Telemachus?": [" There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS. The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal\u2019d his eyes: Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress\u2019d, And all thy fortunes roll\u2019d within his breast.", " The matron with uplifted eyes Attests the all-seeing sovereign of the skies. Then studious she prepares the choicest flour, The strength of wheat and wines an ample store. While to the rival train the prince returns, The martial goddess with impatience burns; Like thee, Telemachus, in voice and size, With speed divine from street to street she flies, She bids the mariners prepared to stand, When night descends, embodied on the strand. Then to Noemon swift she runs, she flies, And asks a bark: the chief a bark supplies. And now, declining with his sloping wheels, Down sunk the sun behind the western hills The goddess shoved the vessel from the shores, And stow\u2019d within its womb the naval stores, Full in the openings of the spacious main It rides; and now descends the sailor-train, Next, to the court, impatient of delay. With rapid step the goddess urged her way; There every eye with slumberous chains she bound, And dash\u2019d the flowing goblet to the ground. Drowsy they rose, with heavy fumes oppress\u2019d, Reel\u2019d from the palace, and retired to rest. Then thus, in Mentor\u2019s reverend form array\u2019d, Spoke to Telemachus the martial maid. \u201cLo! on the seas, prepared the vessel stands, The impatient mariner thy speed demands.\u201d Swift as she spoke, with rapid pace she leads; The footsteps of the deity he treads. Swift to the shore they move along the strand; The ready vessel rides, the sailors ready stand.", " If, studious on your realms, you then demand Their state, since last you left your natal land, Instant the god obsequious will disclose Bright tracts of glory or a cloud of woes.\u2019 \u201cShe ceased; and suppliant thus I made reply: \u2018O goddess I on thy aid my hopes rely; Dictate propitious to my duteous ear, What arts can captivate the changeful seer; For perilous the assay, unheard the toil, To elude the prescience of a god by guile.\u2019 \u201cThus to the goddess mild my suit I end. Then she: \u2018Obedient to my rule attend: When through the zone of heaven the mounted sun Hath journeyed half, and half remains to run; The seer, while zephyrs curl the swelling deep, Basks on the breezy shore, in grateful sleep, His oozy limbs. Emerging from the wave, The Phocas swift surround his rocky cave, Frequent and full; the consecrated train Of her, whose azure trident awes the main; There wallowing warm, the enormous herd exhales An oily steam, and taints the noontide gales. To that recess, commodious for surprise, When purple light shall next suffuse the skies, With me repair; and from thy warrior-band Three chosen chiefs of dauntless soul command; Let their auxiliar force befriend the toil; For strong the god, and perfected in guile. Strech\u2019d on the shelly shore, he first surveys The flouncing herd ascending from the seas; Their number summ\u2019d, reposed in sleep profound The scaly charge their guardian god surround; So with his battening flocks the careful swain Abides pavilion\u2019d on the grassy plain.", " Yet Vulcan conquers, and the god of arms Must pay the penalty for lawless charms.\u201d Thus serious they; but he who gilds the skies, The gay Apollo, thus to Hermes cries: \u201cWouldst thou enchain\u2019d like Mars, O Hermes, lie And bear the shame like Mars to share the joy?\u201d \u201cO envied shame! (the smiling youth rejoin\u2019d;) And thrice the chains, and thrice more firmly bind; Gaze all ye gods, and every goddess gaze, Yet eager would I bless the sweet disgrace.\u201d Loud laugh the rest, e\u2019en Neptune laughs aloud, Yet sues importunate to loose the god. \u201cAnd free, (he cries) O Vulcan! free from shame Thy captives; I ensure the penal claim.\u201d \u201cWill Neptune (Vulcan then) the faithless trust? He suffers who gives surety for the unjust: But say, if that lewd scandal of the sky, To liberty restored, perfidious fly: Say, wilt thou bear the mulct?\u201d He instant cries, \u201cThe mulct I bear, if Mars perfidious flies.\u201d To whom appeased: \u201cNo more I urge delay; When Neptune sues, my part is to obey.\u201d Then to the snares his force the god applies; They burst; and Mars to Thrace indignant flies: To the soft Cyprian shores the goddess moves, To visit Paphos and her blooming groves, Where to the Power an hundred altars rise, And breathing odours scent the balmy skies; Concealed she bathes in consecrated bowers, The Graces unguents shed, ambrosial showers, Unguents that charm the gods! she last assumes Her wondrous robes; and full the goddess blooms."], "How does Eumaeus prove his worth?": [" His bulk and beauty speak no vulgar praise: If, as he seems, he was in better days, Some care his age deserves; or was he prized For worthless beauty? therefore now despised; Such dogs and men there are, mere things of state; And always cherish\u2019d by their friends, the great.\u201d \u201cNot Argus so, (Eumaeus thus rejoin\u2019d,) But served a master of a nobler kind, Who, never, never shall behold him more! Long, long since perish\u2019d on a distant shore! Oh had you seen him, vigorous, bold, and young, Swift as a stag, and as a lion strong: Him no fell savage on the plain withstood, None \u2019scaped him bosom\u2019d in the gloomy wood; His eye how piercing, and his scent how true, To wind the vapour on the tainted dew! Such, when Ulysses left his natal coast: Now years unnerve him, and his lord is lost! The women keep the generous creature bare, A sleek and idle race is all their care: The master gone, the servants what restrains? Or dwells humanity where riot reigns? Jove fix\u2019d it certain, that whatever day Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away.\u201d This said, the honest herdsman strode before; The musing monarch pauses at the door: The dog, whom Fate had granted to behold His lord, when twenty tedious years had roll\u2019d, Takes a last look, and having seen him, dies; So closed for ever faithful Argus\u2019 eyes! And now Telemachus, the first of all, Observed Eumaeus entering in the hall; Distant he saw, across the shady dome; Then gave a sign, and beckon\u2019d him to come: There stood an empty seat, where late was placed, In order due, the steward of the feast, (Who now was busied carving round the board,) Eumaeus took, and placed it near his lord.", " There sate the prince: the feast Eumaeus spread, And heap\u2019d the shining canisters with bread. Thick o\u2019er the board the plenteous viands lay, The frugal remnants of the former day. Then in a bowl he tempers generous wines, Around whose verge a mimic ivy twines. And now, the rage of thirst and hunger fled, Thus young Ulysses to Eumaeus said: \u201cWhence, father, from what shore this stranger, say? What vessel bore him o\u2019er the watery way? To human step our land impervious lies, And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise.\u201d The swain returns: \u201cA tale of sorrows hear: In spacious Crete he drew his natal air; Long doom\u2019d to wander o\u2019er the land and main, For Heaven has wove his thread of life with pain. Half breathless \u2019scaping to the land he flew From Thesprot mariners, a murderous crew. To thee, my son, the suppliant I resign; I gave him my protection, grant him thine.\u201d \u201cHard task (he cries) thy virtue gives thy friend, Willing to aid, unable to defend. Can strangers safely in the court reside, \u2019Midst the swell\u2019d insolence of lust and pride? E\u2019en I unsafe: the queen in doubt to wed, Or pay due honours to the nuptial bed. Perhaps she weds regardless of her fame, Deaf to the mighty Ulyssean name. However, stranger! from our grace receive Such honours as befit a prince to give; Sandals, a sword and robes, respect to prove, And safe to sail with ornaments of love. Till then, thy guest amid the rural train, Far from the court, from danger far, detain.", " The chief indignant grins a ghastly smile; Revenge and scorn within his bosom boil: When thus the prince with pious rage inflamed: \u201cHad not the inglorious wound thy malice aim\u2019d Fall\u2019n guiltless of the mark, my certain spear Had made thee buy the brutal triumph dear: Nor should thy sire a queen his daughter boast; The suitor, now, had vanish\u2019d in a ghost: No more, ye lewd compeers, with lawless power Invade my dome, my herds and flocks devour: For genuine worth, of age mature to know, My grape shall redden, and my harvest grow Or, if each other\u2019s wrongs ye still support, With rapes and riot to profane my court; What single arm with numbers can contend? On me let all your lifted swords descend, And with my life such vile dishonours end.\u201d A long cessation of discourse ensued, By gentler Agelaus thus renew\u2019d: \u201cA just reproof, ye peers! your rage restrain From the protected guest, and menial train: And, prince! to stop the source of future ill, Assent yourself, and gain the royal will. Whilst hope prevail\u2019d to see your sire restored, Of right the queen refused a second lord: But who so vain of faith, so blind to fate, To think he still survives to claim the state? Now press the sovereign dame with warm desire To wed, as wealth or worth her choice inspire: The lord selected to the nuptial joys Far hence will lead the long-contested prize: Whilst in paternal pomp with plenty bless\u2019d, You reign, of this imperial dome possess\u2019d.\u201d Sage and serene Telemachus replies: \u201cBy him at whose behest the thunder flies, And by the name on earth I most revere, By great Ulysses and his woes I swear!", " \u201cThy patient ear hath heard me long relate A story, fruitful of disastrous fate. And now, young prince, indulge my fond request; Be Sparta honoured with his royal guest, Till, from his eastern goal, the joyous sun His twelfth diurnal race begins to run. Meantime my train the friendly gifts prepare, The sprightly coursers and a polish\u2019d car; With these a goblet of capacious mould, Figured with art to dignify the gold (Form\u2019d for libation to the gods), shall prove A pledge and monument of sacred love.\u201d \u201cMy quick return (young Ithacus rejoin\u2019d), Damps the warm wishes of my raptured mind; Did not my fate my needful haste constrain, Charm\u2019d by your speech so graceful and humane, Lost in delight the circling year would roll, While deep attention fix\u2019d my listening soul. But now to Pyle permit my destined way, My loved associates chide my long delay: In dear remembrance of your royal grace, I take the present of the promised vase; The coursers, for the champaign sports retain; That gift our barren rocks will render vain: Horrid with cliffs, our meagre land allows Thin herbage for the mountain goat to browse, But neither mead nor plain supplies, to feed The sprightly courser, or indulge his speed: To sea-surrounded realms the gods assign Small tract of fertile lawn, the least to mine.\u201d His hand the king with tender passion press\u2019d, And, smiling, thus the royal youth address\u2019d: \u201cO early worth!"], "Who kills Antinous\u2019s father?": [" For me, suffice the approbation won Of my great mistress, and her godlike son.\u201d To him Telemachus: \u201cNo more incense The man by nature prone to insolence: Injurious minds just answers but provoke\u201d\u2014 Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke: \u201cThanks to thy care! whose absolute command Thus drives the stranger from our court and land. Heaven bless its owner with a better mind! From envy free, to charity inclined. This both Penelope and I afford: Then, prince! be bounteous of Ulysses\u2019 board. To give another\u2019s is thy hand so slow? So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow?\u201d \u201cWhence, great Telemachus! this lofty strain? (Antinous cries with insolent disdain): Portions like mine if every suitor gave, Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave.\u201d He spoke, and lifting high above the board His ponderous footstool, shook it at his lord. The rest with equal hand conferr\u2019d the bread: He fill\u2019d his scrip, and to the threshold sped; But first before Antinous stopp\u2019d, and said: \u201cBestow, my friend! thou dost not seem the worst Of all the Greeks, but prince-like and the first; Then, as in dignity, be first in worth, And I shall praise thee through the boundless earth. Once I enjoy\u2019d in luxury of state Whate\u2019er gives man the envied name of great; Wealth, servants, friends, were mine in better days And hospitality was then my praise; In every sorrowing soul I pour\u2019d delight, And poverty stood smiling in my sight.", " Ill I deserved these haughty peers\u2019 disdain; Now let them comfort their dejected train, In sweet repast their present hour employ, Nor wait till evening for the genial joy: Then to the lute\u2019s soft voice prolong the night; Music, the banquet\u2019s most refined delight.\u201d He said, then gave a nod; and at the word Telemachus girds on his shining sword. Fast by his father\u2019s side he takes his stand: The beamy javelin lightens in his hand. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT. THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS. Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy. Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver\u2019d deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew: \u201cOne venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes! yet remains to play; Another mark our arrow must attain. Phoebus, assist! nor be the labour vain.\u201d Swift as the word the parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings: Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!", " And as when armourers temper in the ford The keen-edged pole-axe, or the shining sword, The red-hot metal hisses in the lake, Thus in his eye-ball hiss\u2019d the plunging stake. He sends a dreadful groan, the rocks around Through all their inmost winding caves resound. Scared we recoiled. Forth with frantic hand, He tore and dash\u2019d on earth and gory brand; Then calls the Cyclops, all that round him dwell, With voice like thunder, and a direful yell. From all their dens the one-eyed race repair, From rifted rocks, and mountains bleak in air. All haste assembled, at his well-known roar, Inquire the cause, and crowd the cavern door. \u201c\u2018What hurts thee, Polypheme? what strange affright Thus breaks our slumbers, and disturbs the night? Does any mortal, in the unguarded hour Of sleep, oppress thee, or by fraud or power? Or thieves insidious thy fair flock surprise?\u2019 Thus they; the Cyclop from his den replies: \u201c\u2018Friends, Noman kills me; Noman in the hour Of sleep, oppresses me with fraudful power.\u2019 \u2018If no man hurt thee, but the hand divine Inflict disease, it fits thee to resign: To Jove or to thy father Neptune pray.\u2019 The brethren cried, and instant strode away. \u201cJoy touch\u2019d my secret soul and conscious heart, Pleased with the effect of conduct and of art. Meantime the Cyclop, raging with his wound, Spreads his wide arms, and searches round and round: At last, the stone removing from the gate, With hands extended in the midst he sate; And search\u2019d each passing sheep, and fell it o\u2019er, Secure to seize us ere we reach\u2019d the door (Such as his shallow wit he deem\u2019d was mine); But secret I revolved the deep design: \u2019Twas for our lives my labouring bosom wrought; Each scheme I turn\u2019d, and sharpen\u2019d every thought; This way and that I cast to save my friends, Till one resolve my varying counsel ends.", " But not with me the direful murder ends, These, these expired! their crime, they were my friends: Thick as the boars, which some luxurious lord Kills for the feast, to crown the nuptial board. When war has thunder\u2019d with its loudest storms, Death thou hast seen in all her ghastly forms: In duel met her on the listed ground, When hand to hand they wound return for wound; But never have the eyes astonish\u2019d view\u2019d So vile a deed, so dire a scene of blood. E\u2019en in the flow of joy, when now the bowl Glows in our veins, and opens every soul, We groan, we faint; with blood the doom is dyed. And o\u2019er the pavement floats the dreadful tide\u2014 Her breast all gore, with lamentable cries, The bleeding innocent Cassandra dies! Then though pale death froze cold in every vein, My sword I strive to wield, but strive in vain; Nor did my traitress wife these eyelids close, Or decently in death my limbs compose. O woman, woman, when to ill thy mind Is bent, all hell contains no fouler fiend: And such was mine! who basely plunged her sword Through the fond bosom where she reign\u2019d adored! Alas! I hoped the toils of war o\u2019ercome, To meet soft quiet and repose at home; Delusive hope!

ARGUMENT. While Ulysses lies in the vestibule of the palace, he is witness to the disorders of the women. Minerva comforts him, and casts him asleep. At his waking he desires a favourable sign from Jupiter, which is granted. The feast of Apollo is celebrated by the people, and the suitors banquet in the palace. Telemachus exerts his authority amongst them; notwithstanding which, Ulysses is insulted by Caesippus, and the rest continue in their excesses. Strange prodigies are seen by Theoclymenus, the augur, who explains them to the destruction of the wooers. An ample hide devine Ulysses spread. And form\u2019d of fleecy skins his humble bed (The remnants of the spoil the suitor-crowd In festival devour\u2019d, and victims vow\u2019d). Then o\u2019er the chief, Eurynome the chaste With duteous care a downy carpet cast: With dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows, And, ruminating wrath, he scorns repose. As thus pavilion\u2019d in the porch he lay, Scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey, Whilst to nocturnal joys impure repair, With wanton glee, the prostituted fair. His heart with rage this new dishonour stung, Wavering his thoughts in dubious balance hung: Or instant should he quench the guilty flame With their own blood, and intercept the shame: Or to their lust indulge a last embrace, And let the peers consummate the disgrace Round his swoln heart the murmurous fury rolls, As o\u2019er her young the mother-mastiff growls, And bays the stranger groom: so wrath compress\u2019d, Recoiling, mutter\u2019d thunder in his breast."], "What is Odysseus\u2019s most distinguishing trait?": [" Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the Homeric age; however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age; however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics:\u2014still it is difficult to suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram. \u201cIf, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times, the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part.", " The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon."], "What does Telemachus do that makes him seem less competent than his father?": [" Late with such affluence and possessions bless\u2019d, And now in honour\u2019s glorious bed at rest.

If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simenides of Amorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music\u2014the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people, as well as a thirst for new poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer."], "Why do Odysseus, Telemachus, and Athena repeatedly withhold information from Penelope?": [" She hears, and at the word obedient flies.

BOOK XXI. ARGUMENT. THE BENDING OF ULYSSES\u2019 BOW. Penelope, to put an end to the solicitation of the suitors, proposes to marry the person who shall first bend the bow of Ulysses, and shoot through the ringlets."], "What will be the long-term result of Odysseus\u2019s use of wits rather than brute strength?": [" Knight infers from the usage of the word \u03b4\u1f72\u03bb\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u2018writing tablet,\u2019 instead of \u03b4\u03b9\u03c6\u03b8\u1f73\u03c1\u03b1, \u2018skin,\u2019 which, according to Herod 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.\u201d Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope\u2019s design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation, and on my own purpose in the present edition. Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby. It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes, which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present.", " But it is one thing to _use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result? A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions\u2014nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be some grand pervading principle\u2014some invisible, yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never come to the birth.

At last AEgyptius spoke; AEgyptius, by his age and sorrow broke; A length of days his soul with prudence crown\u2019d, A length of days had bent him to the ground. His eldest hope in arms to Ilion came, By great Ulysses taught the path to fame; But (hapless youth) the hideous Cyclops tore His quivering limbs, and quaff\u2019d his spouting gore. Three sons remain\u2019d; to climb with haughty fires The royal bed, Eurynomus aspires; The rest with duteous love his griefs assuage, And ease the sire of half the cares of age. Yet still his Antiphus he loves, he mourns, And, as he stood, he spoke and wept by turns, \u201cSince great Ulysses sought the Phrygian plains, Within these walls inglorious silence reigns. Say then, ye peers! by whose commands we meet? Why here once more in solemn council sit? Ye young, ye old, the weighty cause disclose: Arrives some message of invading foes? Or say, does high necessity of state Inspire some patriot, and demand debate? The present synod speaks its author wise; Assist him, Jove, thou regent of the skies!\u201d He spoke. Telemachus with transport glows, Embraced the omen, and majestic rose (His royal hand the imperial sceptre sway\u2019d); Then thus, addressing to AEgyptius, said: \u201cReverend old man! lo here confess\u2019d he stands By whom ye meet; my grief your care demands. No story I unfold of public woes, Nor bear advices of impending foes: Peace the blest land, and joys incessant crown: Of all this happy realm, I grieve alone."], "When does the story take place?": [" Then, with a manly pace, he took his stand: And grasp\u2019d the bow, and twang\u2019d it in his hand. Three times, with beating heart, he made essay: Three times, unequal to the task, gave way; A modest boldness on his cheek appear\u2019d: And thrice he hoped, and thrice again he fear\u2019d. The fourth had drawn it. The great sire with joy Beheld, but with a sign forbade the boy. His ardour straight the obedient prince suppress\u2019d, And, artful, thus the suitor-train address\u2019d: \u201cO lay the cause on youth yet immature! (For heaven forbid such weakness should endure!) How shall this arm, unequal to the bow, Retort an insult, or repel a foe? But you! whom Heaven with better nerves has bless\u2019d, Accept the trial, and the prize contest.\u201d He cast the bow before him, and apart Against the polish\u2019d quiver propp\u2019d the dart. Resuming then his seat, Eupithes\u2019 son, The bold Antinous, to the rest begun: \u201cFrom where the goblet first begins to flow, From right to left in order take the bow; And prove your several strengths.\u201d The princes heard And first Leiodes, blameless priest\u2019d, appear\u2019d: The eldest born of Oenops\u2019 noble race, Who next the goblet held his holy place: He, only he, of all the suitor throng, Their deeds detested, and abjured the wrong. With tender hands the stubborn horn he strains, The stubborn horn resisted all his pains! Already in despair he gives it o\u2019er: \u201cTake it who will (he cries), I strive no more, What numerous deaths attend this fatal bow!", " Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left Homer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus, a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the stranger to him. \u201cGlaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him, assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the charge of his children.\u201d Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of Chios he established a school, where he taught the precepts of poetry. \u201cTo this day,\u201d says Chandler, \u201cthe most curious remain is that which has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the coast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an arm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a lion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low rim, or seat, and about five yards over.", " To distant Pylos hapless is he gone, To seek his father\u2019s fate and find his own! For traitors wait his way, with dire design To end at once the great Arcesian line. But let us leave him to their wills above; The fates of men are in the hand of Jove. And now, my venerable guest! declare Your name, your parents, and your native air: Sincere from whence begun, your course relate, And to what ship I owe the friendly freight?\u201d Thus he: and thus (with prompt invention bold) The cautious chief his ready story told. \u201cOn dark reserve what better can prevail, Or from the fluent tongue produce the tale, Than when two friends, alone, in peaceful place Confer, and wines and cates the table grace; But most, the kind inviter\u2019s cheerful face? Thus might we sit, with social goblets crown\u2019d, Till the whole circle of the year goes round: Not the whole circle of the year would close My long narration of a life of woes. But such was Heaven\u2019s high will! Know then, I came From sacred Crete, and from a sire of fame: Castor Hylacides (that name he bore), Beloved and honour\u2019d in his native shore; Bless\u2019d in his riches, in his children more. Sprung of a handmaid, from a bought embrace, I shared his kindness with his lawful race: But when that fate, which all must undergo, From earth removed him to the shades below, The large domain his greedy sons divide, And each was portion\u2019d as the lots decide. Little, alas!", " At the same time, so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant, mind of that Athenian would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and reconstruct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we are upon either subject. I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan Confucius. I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attempt, made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency. It is as follows:\u2014 \u201cNo doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to \u2018discourse in excellent music\u2019 among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing around them. But what was passing around them?"], "Why won\u2019t Calypso let Odysseus leave the island of Ogygia?": [" The queen, an nearer view, the guest survey\u2019d, Rob\u2019d in the garments her own hands had made, Not without wonder seen. Then thus began, Her words addressing to the godlike man: \u201cCamest thou hither, wondrous stranger I say, From lands remote and o\u2019er a length of sea? Tell, then, whence art thou? whence, that princely air? And robes like these, so recent and so fair?\u201d \u201cHard is the task, O princess! you impose (Thus sighing spoke the man of many woes), The long, the mournful series to relate Of all my sorrows sent by Heaven and Fate! Yet what you ask, attend. An island lies Beyond these tracts, and under other skies, Ogygia named, in Ocean\u2019s watery arms; Where dwells Calypso, dreadful in her charms! Remote from gods or men she holds her reign, Amid the terrors of a rolling main. Me, only me, the hand of fortune bore, Unblest! to tread that interdicted shore: When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps Launch\u2019d his red lightning at our scattered ships; Then, all my fleet and all my followers lost. Sole on a plank on boiling surges toss\u2019d, Heaven drove my wreck the Ogygian Isle to find, Full nine days floating to the wave and wind. Met by the goddess there with open arms, She bribed my stay with more than human charms; Nay, promised, vainly promised, to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe; But all her blandishments successless prove, To banish from my breast my country\u2019s love. I stay reluctant seven continued years, And water her ambrosial couch with tears, The eighth she voluntary moves to part, Or urged by Jove, or her own changeful heart.", " The queen awakes, deliver\u2019d of her woes; With florid joy her heart dilating glows: The vision, manifest of future fate, Makes her with hope her son\u2019s arrival wait. Meantime the suitors plough the watery plain, Telemachus in thought already slain! When sight of lessening Ithaca was lost Their sail directed for the Samian coast A small but verdant isle appear\u2019d in view, And Asteris the advancing pilot knew; An ample port the rocks projected form, To break the rolling waves and ruffling storm: That safe recess they gain with happy speed, And in close ambush wait the murderous deed. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of Ulysses in the Island of Calypso: whereupon Mercury is sent to command his removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents with much difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, in which he embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is shipwrecked, and in the last danger of death; till Lencothea, a sea-goddess, assists him, and, after innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phaeacia. The saffron morn, with early blushes spread, Now rose refulgent from Tithonus\u2019 bed; With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light. Then met the eternal synod of the sky, Before the god, who thunders from on high, Supreme in might, sublime in majesty.", " Then how, unharm\u2019d, he pass\u2019d the Syren-coasts, The justling rocks where fierce Charybdis raves, And howling Scylla whirls her thunderous waves, The cave of death! How his companions slay The oxen sacred to the god of day. Till Jove in wrath the rattling tempest guides, And whelms the offenders in the roaring tides: How struggling through the surge lie reach\u2019d the shores Of fair Ogygia and Calypso\u2019s bowers; Where the bay blooming nymph constrain\u2019d his stay, With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay; And promised, vainly promised, to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe: How saved from storms Phaeacia\u2019s coast he trod, By great Alcinous honour\u2019d as a god, Who gave him last his country to behold, With change of raiment, brass, and heaps of gold He ended, sinking into sleep, and shares A sweet forgetfulness of all his cares. Soon as soft slumber eased the toils of day, Minerva rushes through the aerial way, And bids Aurora with her golden wheels Flame from the ocean o\u2019er the eastern hills; Uprose Ulysses from the genial bed, And thus with thought mature the monarch said: \u201cMy queen, my consort! through a length of years We drank the cup of sorrow mix\u2019d with tears; Thou, for thy lord; while me the immortal powers Detain\u2019d reluctant from my native shores. Now, bless\u2019d again by Heaven, the queen display, And rule our palace with an equal sway. Be it my care, by loans, or martial toils, To throng my empty folds with gifts or spoils.", " The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the Island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. The man for wisdom\u2019s various arts renown\u2019d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray\u2019d, Their manners noted, and their states survey\u2019d, On stormy seas unnumber\u2019d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom\u2019d them never more (Ah, men unbless\u2019d!)"], "What does Athena predict for Odysseus?": [" So fell Aegysthus; and mayest thou, my friend, (On whom the virtues of thy sire descend,) Make future times thy equal act adore, And be what brave Orestes was before!\u201d The prudent youth replied: \u201cO thou the grace And lasting glory of the Grecian race! Just was the vengeance, and to latest days Shall long posterity resound the praise. Some god this arm with equal prowess bless! And the proud suitors shall its force confess; Injurious men! who while my soul is sore Of fresh affronts, are meditating more. But Heaven denies this honour to my hand, Nor shall my father repossess the land; The father\u2019s fortune never to return, And the sad son\u2019s to softer and to mourn!\u201d Thus he; and Nestor took the word: \u201cMy son, Is it then true, as distant rumours run, That crowds of rivals for thy mother\u2019s charms Thy palace fill with insults and alarms? Say, is the fault, through tame submission, thine? Or leagued against thee, do thy people join, Moved by some oracle, or voice divine? And yet who knows, but ripening lies in fate An hour of vengeance for the afflicted state; When great Ulysses shall suppress these harms, Ulysses singly, or all Greece in arms. But if Athena, war\u2019s triumphant maid, The happy son will as the father aid, (Whose fame and safety was her constant care In every danger and in every war: Never on man did heavenly favour shine With rays so strong, distinguish\u2019d and divine, As those with which Minerva mark\u2019d thy sire) So might she love thee, so thy soul inspire!", " tell me, faithful guide (The youth with prudent modesty replied), How shall I meet, or how accost the sage, Unskill\u2019d in speech, nor yet mature of age? Awful th\u2019approach, and hard the task appears, To question wisely men of riper years.\u201d To whom the martial goddess thus rejoin\u2019d: \u201cSearch, for some thoughts, thy own suggesting mind; And others, dictated by heavenly power, Shall rise spontaneous in the needful hour. For nought unprosperous shall thy ways attend, Born with good omens, and with heaven thy friend.\u201d She spoke, and led the way with swiftest speed; As swift, the youth pursued the way she led; and join\u2019d the band before the sacred fire, Where sate, encompass\u2019d with his sons, the sire. The youth of Pylos, some on pointed wood Transfix\u2019d the fragments, some prepared the food: In friendly throngs they gather to embrace Their unknown guests, and at the banquet place, Pisistratus was first to grasp their hands, And spread soft hides upon the yellow sands; Along the shore the illustrious pair he led, Where Nestor sate with the youthful Thrasymed, To each a portion of the feast he bore, And held the golden goblet foaming o\u2019er; Then first approaching to the elder guest, The latent goddess in these words address\u2019d: \u201cWhoe\u2019er thou art, from fortune brings to keep These rites of Neptune, monarch of the deep, Thee first it fits, O stranger! to prepare The due libation and the solemn prayer; Then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine; Though much thy younger, and his years like mine, He too, I deem, implores the power divine; For all mankind alike require their grace, All born to want; a miserable race!\u201d He spake, and to her hand preferr\u2019d the bowl; A secret pleasure touch\u2019d Athena\u2019s soul, To see the preference due to sacred age Regarded ever by the just and sage.", " The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times.

He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own.

He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon."], "When does Penelope say that she will choose a suitor?": [" near these the Pylian stray\u2019d, And towering Ajax, an illustrious shade!

BOOK XXIII. ARGUMENT. Euryclea awakens Penelope with the news of Ulysses\u2019 return, and the death of the suitors. Penelope scarcely credits her; but supposes some god has punished them, and descends from her department in doubt. At the first interview of Ulysses and Penelope, she is quite unsatisfied. Minerva restores him to the beauty of his youth; but the queen continues incredulous, till by some circumstances she is convinced, and falls into all the transports of passion and tenderness. They recount to each other all that has passed during their long separation. The next morning Ulysses, arming himself and his friends, goes from the city to visit his father. Then to the queen, as in repose she lay, The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way: The transports of her faithful heart supply A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly. \u201cAnd sleeps my child? (the reverend matron cries) Ulysses lives!", " Oh! that as surely great Apollo\u2019s dart, Or some brave suitor\u2019s sword, might pierce the heart Of the proud son; as that we stand this hour In lasting safety from the father\u2019s power!\u201d So spoke the wretch, but, shunning farther fray, Turn\u2019d his proud step, and left them on their way. Straight to the feastful palace he repair\u2019d, Familiar enter\u2019d, and the banquet shared; Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord, He took his place, and plenty heap\u2019d the board. Meantime they heard, soft circling in the sky Sweet airs ascend, and heavenly minstrelsy (For Phemius to the lyre attuned the strain): Ulysses hearken\u2019d, then address\u2019d the swain: \u201cWell may this palace admiration claim, Great and respondent to the master\u2019s fame! Stage above stage the imperial structure stands, Holds the chief honours, and the town commands: High walls and battlements the courts inclose, And the strong gates defy a host of foes. Far other cares its dwellers now employ; The throng\u2019d assembly and the feast of joy: I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire, And hear (what graces every feast) the lyre.\u201d Then thus Eumaeus: \u201cJudge we which were best; Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest Choose you to mingle, while behind I stay? Or I first entering introduce the way? Wait for a space without, but wait not long; This is the house of violence and wrong: Some rude insult thy reverend age may bear; For like their lawless lords the servants are.\u201d \u201cJust is, O friend!", " Till then retain the gifts.\u201d\u2014The hero said, And in his hand the willing stranger led.

Full opposite, before the folding gate, The pensive mother sits in humble state; Lowly she sate, and with dejected view The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew.

Ulysses absent, our ambitious aim With rival loves pursued his royal dame; Her coy reserve, and prudence mix\u2019d with pride, Our common suit nor granted, nor denied; But close with inward hate our deaths design\u2019d; Versed in all arts of wily womankind."], "How do Menelaus and Helen know that Telemachus is Odysseus\u2019s son?": [" There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.

The sacrifice ending with the night, Minerva vanishes from them in the form of an eagle: Telemachus is lodged in the palace. The next morning they sacrifice a bullock to Minerva; and Telemachus proceeds on his journey to Sparta, attended by Pisistratus. The scene lies on the sea-shore of Pylos. The sacred sun, above the waters raised, Through heaven\u2019s eternal brazen portals blazed; And wide o\u2019er earth diffused his cheering ray, To gods and men to give the golden day. Now on the coast of Pyle the vessel falls, Before old Neleus\u2019 venerable walls. There suppliant to the monarch of the flood, At nine green theatres the Pylians stood, Each held five hundred (a deputed train), At each, nine oxen on the sand lay slain. They taste the entrails, and the altars load With smoking thighs, an offering to the god. Full for the port the Ithacensians stand, And furl their sails, and issue on the land. Telemachus already press\u2019d the shore; Not first, the power of wisdom march\u2019d before, And ere the sacrificing throng he join\u2019d, Admonish\u2019d thus his well-attending mind: \u201cProceed, my son! this youthful shame expel; An honest business never blush to tell.

Soon as the morn, in orient purple dress\u2019d, Unbarr\u2019d the portal of the roseate east, The monarch rose; magnificent to view, The imperial mantle o\u2019er his vest he threw; The glittering zone athwart his shoulders cast, A starry falchion low-depending graced; Clasp\u2019d on his feet the embroidered sandals shine; And forth he moves, majestic and divine, Instant to young Telemachus he press\u2019d; And thus benevolent his speech addressed: \u201cSay, royal youth, sincere of soul report Whit cause hath led you to the Spartan court?"], "What do Menelaus and Helen say about Odysseus?": [" There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.

But when the gods these objects of their hate Dragg\u2019d to the destruction by the links of fate; The bard they banish\u2019d from his native soil, And left all helpless in a desert isle; There he, the sweetest of the sacred train, Sung dying to the rocks, but sung in vain.", " To these the cause of meeting they explain, And Menelaus moves to cross the main; Not so the king of men: be will\u2019d to stay, The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay, And calm Minerva\u2019s wrath. Oh blind to fate! The gods not lightly change their love, or hate. With ireful taunts each other they oppose, Till in loud tumult all the Greeks arose.

He had now remained seven years in the Island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. The man for wisdom\u2019s various arts renown\u2019d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray\u2019d, Their manners noted, and their states survey\u2019d, On stormy seas unnumber\u2019d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom\u2019d them never more (Ah, men unbless\u2019d!)", " The queen awakes, deliver\u2019d of her woes; With florid joy her heart dilating glows: The vision, manifest of future fate, Makes her with hope her son\u2019s arrival wait. Meantime the suitors plough the watery plain, Telemachus in thought already slain! When sight of lessening Ithaca was lost Their sail directed for the Samian coast A small but verdant isle appear\u2019d in view, And Asteris the advancing pilot knew; An ample port the rocks projected form, To break the rolling waves and ruffling storm: That safe recess they gain with happy speed, And in close ambush wait the murderous deed. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of Ulysses in the Island of Calypso: whereupon Mercury is sent to command his removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents with much difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, in which he embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is shipwrecked, and in the last danger of death; till Lencothea, a sea-goddess, assists him, and, after innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phaeacia. The saffron morn, with early blushes spread, Now rose refulgent from Tithonus\u2019 bed; With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light. Then met the eternal synod of the sky, Before the god, who thunders from on high, Supreme in might, sublime in majesty.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS.

With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes, He purged the walls, and blood-polluted rooms. Again the matron springs with eager pace, And spreads her lord\u2019s return from place to place. They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand, A gazing throng, a torch in every hand. They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace Each humbly kiss\u2019d his knee, or hand, or face; He knows them all, in all such truth appears, E\u2019en he indulges the sweet joy of tears. BOOK XXIII. ARGUMENT. Euryclea awakens Penelope with the news of Ulysses\u2019 return, and the death of the suitors. Penelope scarcely credits her; but supposes some god has punished them, and descends from her department in doubt. At the first interview of Ulysses and Penelope, she is quite unsatisfied. Minerva restores him to the beauty of his youth; but the queen continues incredulous, till by some circumstances she is convinced, and falls into all the transports of passion and tenderness. They recount to each other all that has passed during their long separation. The next morning Ulysses, arming himself and his friends, goes from the city to visit his father. Then to the queen, as in repose she lay, The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way: The transports of her faithful heart supply A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly. \u201cAnd sleeps my child? (the reverend matron cries) Ulysses lives!", " Our sight the whole collected navy cheer\u2019d. Who, waiting long, by turns had hoped and fear\u2019d. There disembarking on the green sea side, We land our cattle, and the spoil divide; Of these due shares to every sailor fall; The master ram was voted mine by all; And him (the guardian of Ulysses\u2019 fate) With pious mind to heaven I consecrate. But the great god, whose thunder rends the skies, Averse, beholds the smoking sacrifice; And sees me wandering still from coast to coast, And all my vessels, all my people, lost! While thoughtless we indulge the genial rite, As plenteous cates and flowing bowls invite; Till evening Phoebus roll\u2019d away the light; Stretch\u2019d on the shore in careless ease we rest, Till ruddy morning purpled o\u2019er the east; Then from their anchors all our ships unbind, And mount the decks, and call the willing wind. Now, ranged in order on our banks we sweep. With hasty strokes the hoarse-resounding deep; Blind to the future, pensive with our fears, Glad for the living, for the dead in tears.\u201d BOOK X. ARGUMENT. ADVENTURES WITH AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONS, AND CIRCE. Ulysses arrives at the island of AEolus, who gives him prosperous winds, and incloses the adverse ones in a bag, which his companions untying, they are driven back again and rejected. Then they sail to the Laestrygons, where they lose eleven ships, and, with only one remaining, proceed to the island of Circe. Eurylochus is sent first with some companions, all which, except Eurylochus, are transformed into swine.", " (the queen rejoin\u2019d,) Distracting fears confound my labouring mind; Powerless to speak. I scarce uplift my eyes, Nor dare to question; doubts on doubts arise. Oh deign he, if Ulysses, to remove These boding thoughts, and what he is, to prove!\u201d Pleased with her virtuous fears, the king replies: \u201cIndulge, my son, the cautions of the wise; Time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring: This garb of poverty belies the king: No more. This day our deepest care requires, Cautious to act what thought mature inspires. If one man\u2019s blood, though mean, distain our hands, The homicide retreats to foreign lands; By us, in heaps the illustrious peerage falls, The important deed our whole attention calls.\u201d \u201cBe that thy care (Telemachus replies) The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise; For wisdom all is thine! lo, I obey, And dauntless follow where you led the way; Nor shalt thou in the day of danger find Thy coward son degenerate lag behind.\u201d \u201cThen instant to the bath (the monarch cries), Bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise, Thence all descend in pomp and proud array, And bid the dome resound the mirthful lay; While the sweet lyrist airs of rapture sings, And forms the dance responsive to the strings, That hence the eluded passengers may say, \u2018Lo! the queen weds! we hear the spousal lay!\u2019 The suitor\u2019s death, unknown, till we remove Far from the court, and act inspired by Jove.\u201d Thus spoke the king: the observant train obey, At once they bathe, and dress in proud array: The lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance, And fair-zoned damsels form the sprightly dance.", " BOOK XX. ARGUMENT. While Ulysses lies in the vestibule of the palace, he is witness to the disorders of the women. Minerva comforts him, and casts him asleep. At his waking he desires a favourable sign from Jupiter, which is granted. The feast of Apollo is celebrated by the people, and the suitors banquet in the palace. Telemachus exerts his authority amongst them; notwithstanding which, Ulysses is insulted by Caesippus, and the rest continue in their excesses. Strange prodigies are seen by Theoclymenus, the augur, who explains them to the destruction of the wooers. An ample hide devine Ulysses spread. And form\u2019d of fleecy skins his humble bed (The remnants of the spoil the suitor-crowd In festival devour\u2019d, and victims vow\u2019d). Then o\u2019er the chief, Eurynome the chaste With duteous care a downy carpet cast: With dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows, And, ruminating wrath, he scorns repose. As thus pavilion\u2019d in the porch he lay, Scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey, Whilst to nocturnal joys impure repair, With wanton glee, the prostituted fair. His heart with rage this new dishonour stung, Wavering his thoughts in dubious balance hung: Or instant should he quench the guilty flame With their own blood, and intercept the shame: Or to their lust indulge a last embrace, And let the peers consummate the disgrace Round his swoln heart the murmurous fury rolls, As o\u2019er her young the mother-mastiff growls, And bays the stranger groom: so wrath compress\u2019d, Recoiling, mutter\u2019d thunder in his breast."], "What do the gods decide to do about Odysseus?": [" To distant Pylos hapless is he gone, To seek his father\u2019s fate and find his own! For traitors wait his way, with dire design To end at once the great Arcesian line. But let us leave him to their wills above; The fates of men are in the hand of Jove. And now, my venerable guest! declare Your name, your parents, and your native air: Sincere from whence begun, your course relate, And to what ship I owe the friendly freight?\u201d Thus he: and thus (with prompt invention bold) The cautious chief his ready story told. \u201cOn dark reserve what better can prevail, Or from the fluent tongue produce the tale, Than when two friends, alone, in peaceful place Confer, and wines and cates the table grace; But most, the kind inviter\u2019s cheerful face? Thus might we sit, with social goblets crown\u2019d, Till the whole circle of the year goes round: Not the whole circle of the year would close My long narration of a life of woes. But such was Heaven\u2019s high will! Know then, I came From sacred Crete, and from a sire of fame: Castor Hylacides (that name he bore), Beloved and honour\u2019d in his native shore; Bless\u2019d in his riches, in his children more. Sprung of a handmaid, from a bought embrace, I shared his kindness with his lawful race: But when that fate, which all must undergo, From earth removed him to the shades below, The large domain his greedy sons divide, And each was portion\u2019d as the lots decide.

Deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secured; With ribs of steel, and marble heart, immured. When Heaven, auspicious to thy right avow\u2019d, Shall prostrate to thy sword the suitor-crowd, The deeds I\u2019ll blazon of the menial fair; The lewd to death devote, the virtuous spare.\u201d \u201cThy aid avails me not (the chief replied); My own experience shall their doom decide: A witness-judge precludes a long appeal: Suffice it then thy monarch to conceal.\u201d He said: obsequious, with redoubled pace, She to the fount conveys the exhausted vase: The bath renew\u2019d, she ends the pleasing toil With plenteous unction of ambrosial oil. Adjusting to his limbs the tatter\u2019d vest, His former seat received the stranger guest; Whom thus with pensive air the queen addressed: \u201cThough night, dissolving grief in grateful ease, Your drooping eyes with soft impression seize; Awhile, reluctant to her pleasing force, Suspend the restful hour with sweet discourse. The day (ne\u2019er brighten\u2019d with a beam of joy!)

Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon.", " As when the months are clad in flowery green, Sad Philomel, in bowery shades unseen, To vernal airs attunes her varied strains; And Itylus sounds warbling o\u2019er the plains; Young Itylus, his parents\u2019 darling joy! Whom chance misled the mother to destroy; Now doom\u2019d a wakeful bird to wail the beauteous boy. So in nocturnal solitude forlorn, A sad variety of woes I mourn! My mind, reflective, in a thorny maze Devious from care to care incessant strays. Now, wavering doubt succeeds to long despair; Shall I my virgin nuptial vow revere; And, joining to my son\u2019s my menial train, Partake his counsels, and assist his reign? Or, since, mature in manhood, he deplores His dome dishonour\u2019d, and exhausted stores; Shall I, reluctant! to his will accord; And from the peers select the noblest lord; So by my choice avow\u2019d, at length decide These wasteful love-debates, a mourning bride! A visionary thought I\u2019ll now relate; Illustrate, if you know, the shadow\u2019d fate: \u201cA team of twenty geese (a snow-white train!) Fed near the limpid lake with golden grain, Amuse my pensive hours. The bird of Jove Fierce from his mountain-eyrie downward drove; Each favourite fowl he pounced with deathful sway, And back triumphant wing\u2019d his airy way. My pitying eyes effused a plenteous stream, To view their death thus imaged in a dream; With tender sympathy to soothe my soul, A troop of matrons, fancy-form\u2019d, condole."], "What is Calypso\u2019s big gripe against the gods?": [" The queen awakes, deliver\u2019d of her woes; With florid joy her heart dilating glows: The vision, manifest of future fate, Makes her with hope her son\u2019s arrival wait. Meantime the suitors plough the watery plain, Telemachus in thought already slain! When sight of lessening Ithaca was lost Their sail directed for the Samian coast A small but verdant isle appear\u2019d in view, And Asteris the advancing pilot knew; An ample port the rocks projected form, To break the rolling waves and ruffling storm: That safe recess they gain with happy speed, And in close ambush wait the murderous deed. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of Ulysses in the Island of Calypso: whereupon Mercury is sent to command his removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents with much difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, in which he embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is shipwrecked, and in the last danger of death; till Lencothea, a sea-goddess, assists him, and, after innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phaeacia. The saffron morn, with early blushes spread, Now rose refulgent from Tithonus\u2019 bed; With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light. Then met the eternal synod of the sky, Before the god, who thunders from on high, Supreme in might, sublime in majesty.", " The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the Island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. The man for wisdom\u2019s various arts renown\u2019d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray\u2019d, Their manners noted, and their states survey\u2019d, On stormy seas unnumber\u2019d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom\u2019d them never more (Ah, men unbless\u2019d!)", " These, if the gods with my desire comply (The gods, alas, more mighty far than I, And better skill\u2019d in dark events to come), In peace shall land thee at thy native home.\u201d With sighs Ulysses heard the words she spoke, Then thus his melancholy silence broke: \u201cSome other motive, goddess! sways thy mind (Some close design, or turn of womankind), Nor my return the end, nor this the way, On a slight raft to pass the swelling sea, Huge, horrid, vast! where scarce in safety sails The best-built ship, though Jove inspires the gales. The bold proposal how shall I fulfil, Dark as I am, unconscious of thy will? Swear, then, thou mean\u2019st not what my soul forebodes; Swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods.\u201d Him, while he spoke, with smiles Calypso eyed, And gently grasp\u2019d his hand, and thus replied: \u201cThis shows thee, friend, by old experience taught, And learn\u2019d in all the wiles of human thought, How prone to doubt, how cautious, are the wise! But hear, O earth, and hear, ye sacred skies! And thou, O Styx! whose formidable floods Glide through the shades, and bind the attesting gods! No form\u2019d design, no meditated end, Lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend; Kind the persuasion, and sincere my aim; The same my practice, were my fate the same. Heaven has not cursed me with a heart of steel, But given the sense to pity, and to feel.\u201d Thus having said, the goddess marched before: He trod her footsteps in the sandy shore.", " Without the grot a various sylvan scene Appear\u2019d around, and groves of living green; Poplars and alders ever quivering play\u2019d, And nodding cypress form\u2019d a fragrant shade: On whose high branches, waving with the storm, The birds of broadest wing their mansions form,\u2014 The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow,\u2014 and scream aloft, and skim the deeps below. Depending vines the shelving cavern screen. With purple clusters blushing through the green. Four limped fountains from the clefts distil: And every fountain pours a several rill, In mazy windings wandering down the hill: Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crown\u2019d, And glowing violets threw odours round. A scene, where, if a god should cast his sight, A god might gaze, and wander with delight! Joy touch\u2019d the messenger of heaven: he stay\u2019d Entranced, and all the blissful haunts surveyed.

But sad Ulysses, by himself apart, Pour\u2019d the big sorrows of his swelling heard; All on the lonely shore he sate to weep, And roll\u2019d his eyes around the restless deep: Toward his loved coast he roll\u2019d his eyes in vain, Till, dimm\u2019d with rising grief, they stream\u2019d again.

Pirates perhaps, who seek through seas unknown The lives of others, and expose your own?\u2019 \u201cHis voice like thunder through the cavern sounds; My bold companions thrilling fear confounds, Appall\u2019d at sight of more than mortal man! At length, with heart recover\u2019d, I began: \u201c\u2018From Troy\u2019s famed fields, sad wanderers o\u2019er the main, Behold the relics of the Grecian train: Through various seas, by various perils toss\u2019d, And forced by storms, unwilling on your coast; Far from our destined course and native land, Such was our fate, and such high Jove\u2019s command! Nor what we are befits us to disclaim, Atrides\u2019 friends (in arms a mighty name), Who taught proud Troy and all her sons to bow; Victors of late, but humble suppliants now! Low at thy knee thy succour we implore; Respect us, human, and relieve us, poor. At least, some hospitable gift bestow; \u2019Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe; \u2019Tis what the gods require: those gods revere; The poor and stranger are their constant care; To Jove their cause, and their revenge belongs, He wanders with them, and he feels their wrongs.\u201d \u201c\u2018Fools that ye are (the savage thus replies, His inward fury blazing at his eyes), Or strangers, distant far from our abodes, To bid me reverence or regard the gods.", " Whate\u2019er the gods shall destine me to bear; In the black ocean or the watery war, \u2019Tis mine to master with a constant mind; Inured to perils, to the worst resign\u2019d, By seas, by wars, so many dangers run; Still I can suffer; their high will he done!\u201d Thus while he spoke, the beamy sun descends, And rising night her friendly shade extends, To the close grot the lonely pair remove, And slept delighted with the gifts of love.

On the lone island\u2019s utmost verge there stood Of poplars, pine, and firs, a lofty wood, Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire, Scorch\u2019d by the sun, or seared by heavenly fire (Already dried).

BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. Pallas appearing in a dream in to Nausicaa (the daughter of Alcinous, king of Phaeacia, commands her to descend to the river, and wash the robes of state, in preparation for her nuptials. Nausicaa goes with her handmaidens to the river; where, while the garments are spread on the bank, they divert themselves in sports. Their voices awaken Ulysses, who, addressing himself to the princess, is by her relieved and clothed, and receives directions in what manner to apply to the king and queen of the island. While thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest, And peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast, The martial maid from heavens aerial height Swift to Phaeacia wing\u2019d her rapid flight, In elder times the soft Phaeacian train In ease possess\u2019d the wide Hyperian plain; Till the Cyclopean race in arms arose A lawless nation of gigantic foes; Then great Nausithous from Hyperia far, Through seas retreating from the sounds of war, The recreant nation to fair Scheria led, Where never science rear\u2019d her laurell\u2019d head; There round his tribes a strength of wall he raised; To heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed; Just to his realms, he parted grounds from grounds, And shared the lands, and gave the lands their bounds.", " With equal grace Nausicaa trod the plain, And shone transcendent o\u2019er the beauteous train. Meantime (the care and favourite of the skies Wrapp\u2019d in imbowering shade, Ulysses lies, His woes forgot! but Pallas now address\u2019d To break the bands of all-composing rest. Forth from her snowy hand Nausicaa threw The various ball; the ball erroneous flew And swam the stream; loud shrieks the virgin train, And the loud shriek redoubles from the main. Waked by the shrilling sound, Ulysses rose, And, to the deaf woods wailing, breathed his woes: \u201cAh me! on what inhospitable coast, On what new region is Ulysses toss\u2019d; Possess\u2019d by wild barbarians fierce in arms; Or men, whose bosom tender pity warms? What sounds are these that gather from he shores? The voice of nymphs that haunt the sylvan bowers, The fair-hair\u2019d Dryads of the shady wood; Or azure daughters of the silver flood; Or human voice? but issuing from the shades, Why cease I straight to learn what sound invades?\u201d Then, where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends, With forceful strength a branch the hero rends; Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads A wreathy foliage and concealing shades. As when a lion in the midnight hours, Beat by rude blasts, and wet with wintry showers, Descends terrific from the mountains brow; With living flames his rolling eye balls glow; With conscious strength elate, he bends his way, Majestically fierce, to seize his prey (The steer or stag;) or, with keen hunger bold, Spring o\u2019er the fence and dissipates the fold.", " But haste, the viands and the bowl provide.\u201d The maids the viands and the bowl supplied: Eager he fed, for keen his hunger raged, And with the generous vintage thirst assuaged. Now on return her care Nausicaa bends, The robes resumes, the glittering car ascends, Far blooming o\u2019er the field; and as she press\u2019d The splendid seat, the listening chief address\u2019d: \u201cStranger, arise! the sun rolls down the day. Lo, to the palace I direct thy way; Where, in high state, the nobles of the land Attend my royal sire, a radiant band But hear, though wisdom in thy soul presides, Speaks from thy tongue, and every action guides; Advance at distance, while I pass the plain Where o\u2019er the furrows waves the golden grain; Alone I reascend\u2014With airy mounds A strength of wall the guarded city bounds; The jutting land two ample bays divides: Full through the narrow mouths descend the tides; The spacious basons arching rocks enclose, A sure defence from every storm that blows. Close to the bay great Neptune\u2019s fane adjoins; And near, a forum flank\u2019d with marble shines, Where the bold youth, the numerous fleets to store, Shape the broad sail, or smooth the taper oar: For not the bow they bend, nor boast the skill To give the feather\u2019d arrow wings to kill; But the tall mast above the vessel rear, Or teach the fluttering sail to float in air. They rush into the deep with eager joy, Climb the steep surge, and through the tempest fly; A proud, unpolish\u2019d race\u2014To me belongs The care to shun the blast of slanderous tongues; Lest malice, prone the virtuous to defame, Thus with wild censure taint my spotless name: \u2018What stranger this whom thus Nausicaa leads!", " To distant Pylos hapless is he gone, To seek his father\u2019s fate and find his own!

Thus might we sit, with social goblets crown\u2019d, Till the whole circle of the year goes round: Not the whole circle of the year would close My long narration of a life of woes. But such was Heaven\u2019s high will! Know then, I came From sacred Crete, and from a sire of fame: Castor Hylacides (that name he bore), Beloved and honour\u2019d in his native shore; Bless\u2019d in his riches, in his children more. Sprung of a handmaid, from a bought embrace, I shared his kindness with his lawful race: But when that fate, which all must undergo, From earth removed him to the shades below, The large domain his greedy sons divide, And each was portion\u2019d as the lots decide. Little, alas!"], "What does the young girl do to help Odysseus get to the palace?": [" Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes. Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named Critheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we \u201care indebted for so much happiness.\u201d Homer was the first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of Melesigenes from having been born near the river Meles in B\u0153otia, whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation. \u201cAt this time,\u201d continues our narrative, \u201cthere lived at Smyrna a man named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man, if he were carefully brought up.\u201d They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father\u2019s school with great success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city.", " He is met by Pallas in the form of a young virgin, who guides him to the palace, and directs him in what manner to address the queen Arete. She then involves him in a mist which causes him to pass invisible. The palace and gardens of Alcinous described. Ulysses falling at the feet of the queen, the mist disperses, the Phaecians admire, and receive him with respect.

From there they sailed to the land of the Cyclops, whose manners and situation are particularly characterised. The giant Polyphemus and his cave described; the usage Ulysses and his companions met with there; and, lastly, the method and artifice by which he escaped. Then thus Ulysses: \u201cThou whom first in sway, As first in virtue, these thy realms obey; How sweet the products of a peaceful reign! The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain; The well-filled palace, the perpetual feast, A land rejoicing, and a people bless\u2019d!

Forgive me, father, if this fault I blame; Age so advanced, may some indulgence claim. Not for thy sloth, I deem thy lord unkind: Nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind; I read a monarch in that princely air, The same thy aspect, if the same thy care; Soft sleep, fair garments, and the joys of wine, These are the rights of age, and should be thine.

THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of Ulysses in the Island of Calypso: whereupon Mercury is sent to command his removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents with much difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, in which he embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is shipwrecked, and in the last danger of death; till Lencothea, a sea-goddess, assists him, and, after innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phaeacia. The saffron morn, with early blushes spread, Now rose refulgent from Tithonus\u2019 bed; With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light.

Having passed over the Hermaean plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae. Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one Tychias, an armourer. \u201cAnd up to my time,\u201d continues the author, \u201cthe inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses; and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived.\u201d But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus. Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the _conversaziones_ of the old men, and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously renowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal. The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet\u2019s demand, but one man \u201cobserved that if they were to feed _Homers_, they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.\u201d \u201cFrom this circumstance,\u201d says the writer, \u201cMelesigenes acquired the name of Homer, for the Cumans call blind men _Homers_.\u201d With a love of economy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that Cumae might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory."], "What does Odysseus say that his name is?": [" The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times.

I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we are upon either subject. I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan Confucius. I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attempt, made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency. It is as follows:\u2014 \u201cNo doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to \u2018discourse in excellent music\u2019 among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing around them. But what was passing around them?", " Incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed. If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simenides of Amorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music\u2014the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people, as well as a thirst for new poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer."], "What does Circe do to some of Odysseus\u2019s men?": [" Worn as I am with griefs, with care decay\u2019d, Never, I never scene so dire survey\u2019d!

Destruction sure o\u2019er all your heads impends Ulysses comes, and death his steps attends. Nor to the great alone is death decreed; We and our guilty Ithaca must bleed. Why cease we then the wrath of heaven to stay? Be humbled all, and lead, ye great! the way. For lo my words no fancied woes relate; I speak from science and the voice of fate. \u201cWhen great Ulysses sought the Phrygian shores To shake with war proud Ilion\u2019s lofty towers, Deeds then undone my faithful tongue foretold: Heaven seal\u2019d my words, and you those deeds behold. I see (I cried) his woes, a countless train; I see his friends o\u2019erwhelm\u2019d beneath the main; How twice ten years from shore to shore he roams: Now twice ten years are past, and now he comes!\u201d To whom Eurymachus\u2014\u201cFly, dotard fly, With thy wise dreams, and fables of the sky. Go prophesy at home, thy sons advise: Here thou art sage in vain\u2014I better read the skies Unnumber\u2019d birds glide through the aerial way; Vagrants of air, and unforeboding stray. Cold in the tomb, or in the deeps below, Ulysses lies; oh wert thou laid as low! Then would that busy head no broils suggest, For fire to rage Telemachus\u2019 breast, From him some bribe thy venal tongue requires, And interest, not the god, thy voice inspires. His guideless youth, if thy experienced age Mislead fallacious into idle rage, Vengeance deserved thy malice shall repress.", " Chief, if it hurt not great Antinous\u2019 ear (Whose sage decision I with wonder hear), And if Eurymachus the motion please: Give Heaven this day and rest the bow in peace. To-morrow let your arms dispute the prize, And take it he, the favour\u2019d of the skies! But, since till then this trial you delay, Trust it one moment to my hands to-day: Fain would I prove, before your judging eyes, What once I was, whom wretched you despise: If yet this arm its ancient force retain; Or if my woes (a long-continued train) And wants and insults, make me less than man.\u201d Rage flash\u2019d in lightning from the suitors\u2019 eyes, Yet mixed with terror at the bold emprise. Antinous then: \u201cO miserable guest! Is common sense quite banish\u2019d from thy breast? Sufficed it not, within the palace placed, To sit distinguish\u2019d, with our presence graced, Admitted here with princes to confer, A man unknown, a needy wanderer? To copious wine this insolence we owe, And much thy betters wine can overthrow: The great Eurytian when this frenzy stung, Pirithous\u2019 roofs with frantic riot rung; Boundless the Centaur raged; till one and all The heroes rose, and dragg\u2019d him from the hall; His nose they shorten\u2019d, and his ears they slit, And sent him sober\u2019d home, with better wit. Hence with long war the double race was cursed, Fatal to all, but to the aggressor first. Such fate I prophesy our guest attends, If here this interdicted bow he bends: Nor shall these walls such insolence contain: The first fair wind transports him o\u2019er the main, Where Echetus to death the guilty brings (The worst of mortals, e\u2019en the worst of kings).", " if thy impudence but dare Approach yon wall, I prophesy thy fare: Dearly, full dearly, shalt thou buy thy bread With many a footstool thundering at thy head.\u201d He thus: nor insolent of word alone, Spurn\u2019d with his rustic heel his king unknown; Spurn\u2019d, but not moved: he like a pillar stood, Nor stirr\u2019d an inch, contemptuous, from the road: Doubtful, or with his staff to strike him dead, Or greet the pavement with his worthless head. Short was that doubt; to quell his rage inured, The hero stood self-conquer\u2019d, and endured. But hateful of the wretch, Eumaeus heaved His hands obtesting, and this prayer conceived: \u201cDaughters of Jove! who from the ethereal bowers Descend to swell the springs, and feed the flowers! Nymphs of this fountain! to whose sacred names Our rural victims mount in blazing flames! To whom Ulysses\u2019 piety preferr\u2019d The yearly firstlings of his flock and herd; Succeed my wish, your votary restore: Oh, be some god his convoy to our shore! Due pains shall punish then this slave\u2019s offence, And humble all his airs of insolence, Who, proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large, Commences courtier, and neglects his charge.\u201d \u201cWhat mutters he? (Melanthius sharp rejoins;) This crafty miscreant, big with dark designs? The day shall come\u2014nay, \u2019tis already near\u2014 When, slave! to sell thee at a price too dear Must be my care; and hence transport thee o\u2019er, A load and scandal to this happy shore."], "What does Odysseus do when he approaches the islands of the Sirens?": [" to mercy be thy soul inclined, And spare the poet\u2019s ever-gentle kind. A deed like this thy future fame would wrong, For dear to gods and men is sacred song. Self-taught I sing; by Heaven, and Heaven alone, The genuine seeds of poesy are sown: And (what the gods bestow) the lofty lay To gods alone and godlike worth we pay. Save then the poet, and thyself reward! \u2019Tis thine to merit, mine is to record. That here I sung, was force, and not desire; This hand reluctant touch\u2019d the warbling wire; And let thy son attest, nor sordid pay, Nor servile flattery, stain\u2019d the moral lay.\u201d The moving words Telemachus attends, His sire approaches, and the bard defends. \u201cO mix not, father, with those impious dead The man divine! forbear that sacred head; Medon, the herald, too, our arms may spare, Medon, who made my infancy his care; If yet he breathes, permit thy son to give Thus much to gratitude, and bid him live.\u201d Beneath a table, trembling with dismay, Couch\u2019d close to earth, unhappy Medon lay, Wrapp\u2019d in a new-slain ox\u2019s ample hide; Swift at the word he cast his screen aside, Sprung to the prince, embraced his knee with tears, And thus with grateful voice address\u2019d his ears \u201cO prince!

Then curious she commands me to relate The dreadful scenes of Pluto\u2019s dreary state.

Unblest the man, whom music wins to stay Nigh the cursed shore and listen to the lay. No more that wretch shall view the joys of life His blooming offspring, or his beauteous wife!

Then to my mates I measured back the plain, Climb\u2019d the tall bark, and rush\u2019d into the main; Then, bending to the stroke, their oars they drew To their broad breasts, and swift the galley flew. Up sprung a brisker breeze; with freshening gales The friendly goddess stretch\u2019d the swelling sails; We drop our oars; at ease the pilot guides; The vessel light along the level glides. When, rising sad and slow, with pensive look, Thus to the melancholy train I spoke: \u201c\u2018O friends, oh ever partners of my woes, Attend while I what Heaven foredooms disclose. Hear all! Fate hangs o\u2019er all; on you it lies To live or perish! to be safe, be wise! \u201c\u2018In flowery meads the sportive Sirens play, Touch the soft lyre, and tune the vocal lay; Me, me alone, with fetters firmly bound, The gods allow to hear the dangerous sound. Hear and obey; if freedom I demand, Be every fetter strain\u2019d, be added band to band.\u2019 \u201cWhile yet I speak the winged galley flies, And lo! the Siren shores like mists arise. Sunk were at once the winds; the air above, And waves below, at once forgot to move; Some demon calm\u2019d the air and smooth\u2019d the deep, Hush\u2019d the loud winds, and charm\u2019d the waves to sleep.", " The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him.

ARGUMENT. THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS. He relates how, after his return from the shades, he was sent by Circe on his voyage, by the coast of the Sirens, and by the strait of Scylla and Charybdis: the manner in which he escaped those dangers: how, being cast on the island Trinacria, his companions destroyed the oxen of the Sun: the vengeance that followed; how all perished by shipwreck except himself, who, swimming on the mast of the ship, arrived on the island of Calypso. With which his narration concludes. \u201cThus o\u2019er the rolling surge the vessel flies, Till from the waves the AEaean hills arise. Here the gay Morn resides in radiant bowers, Here keeps here revels with the dancing Hours; Here Phoebus, rising in the ethereal way, Through heaven\u2019s bright portals pours the beamy day.", " \u201cNow sunk the west, and now a southern breeze, More dreadful than the tempest lash\u2019d the seas; For on the rocks it bore where Scylla raves, And dire Charybdis rolls her thundering waves. All night I drove; and at the dawn of day, Fast by the rocks beheld the desperate way; Just when the sea within her gulfs subsides, And in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides, Swift from the float I vaulted with a bound, The lofty fig-tree seized, and clung around; So to the beam the bat tenacious clings, And pendent round it clasps his leather wings. High in the air the tree its boughs display\u2019d, And o\u2019er the dungeon cast a dreadful shade; All unsustain\u2019d between the wave and sky, Beneath my feet the whirling billows fly. What time the judge forsakes the noisy bar To take repast, and stills the wordy war, Charybdis, rumbling from her inmost caves, The mast refunded on her refluent waves. Swift from the tree, the floating mass to gain, Sudden I dropp\u2019d amidst the flashing main; Once more undaunted on the ruin rode, And oar\u2019d with labouring arms along the flood. Unseen I pass\u2019d by Scylla\u2019s dire abodes. So Jove decreed (dread sire of men and gods). Then nine long days I plow\u2019d the calmer seas, Heaved by the surge, and wafted by the breeze. Weary and wet the Ogygian shores I gain, When the tenth sun descended to the main. There, in Calypso\u2019s ever-fragrant bowers, Refresh\u2019d I lay, and joy beguiled the hours.", " Wide to the west the horrid gulf extends, And the dire passage down to hell descends. O fly the dreadful sight! expand thy sails, Ply the strong oar, and catch the nimble gales; Here Scylla bellows from the dire abodes, Tremendous pest, abhorr\u2019d by man and gods! Hideous her voice, and with less terrors roar The whelps of lions in the midnight hour. Twelve feet, deform\u2019d and foul, the fiend dispreads; Six horrid necks she rears, and six terrific heads; Her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth; Jaggy they stand, the gaping den of death; Her parts obscene the raging billows hide; Her bosom terribly o\u2019erlooks the tide. When stung with hunger she embroils the flood, The sea-dog and the dolphin are her food; She makes the huge leviathan her prey, And all the monsters of the watery way; The swiftest racer of the azure plain Here fills her sails, and spreads her oars in vain; Fell Scylla rises, in her fury roars, At once six mouths expands, at once six men devours. \u201c\u2018Close by, a rock of less enormous height Breaks the wild waves, and forms a dangerous strait; Full on its crown a fig\u2019s green branches rise, And shoot a leafy forest to the skies; Beneath, Charybdis holds her boisterous reign \u2019Midst roaring whirlpools, and absorbs the main; Thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside, Thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide. Oh, if thy vessel plough the direful waves, When seas retreating roar within her caves, Ye perish all!", " Around the dungeon, studious to behold The hideous pest, my labouring eyes I roll\u2019d; In vain! the dismal dungeon, dark as night, Veils the dire monster, and confounds the sight. \u201cNow through the rocks, appall\u2019d with deep dismay, We bend our course, and stem the desperate way; Dire Scylla there a scene of horror forms, And here Charybdis fills the deep with storms. When the tide rushes from her rumbling caves, The rough rock roars, tumultuous boil the waves; They toss, they foam, a wild confusion raise, Like waters bubbling o\u2019er the fiery blaze; Eternal mists obscure the aerial plain, And high above the rock she spouts the main; When in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides, She drains the ocean with the refluent tides; The rock re-bellows with a thundering sound; Deep, wondrous deep, below appears the ground. \u201cStruck with despair, with trembling hearts we view\u2019d The yawning dungeon, and the tumbling flood; When lo! fierce Scylla stoop\u2019d to seize her prey, Stretch\u2019d her dire jaws, and swept six men away. Chiefs of renown! loud-echoing shrieks arise; I turn, and view them quivering in the skies; They call, and aid with outstretch\u2019d arms implore; In vain they call! those arms are stretch\u2019d no more. As from some rock that overhangs the flood The silent fisher casts the insidious food, With fraudful care he waits the finny prize, And sudden lifts it quivering to the skies: So the foul monster lifts her prey on high, So pant the wretches struggling in the sky; In the wide dungeon she devours her food, And the flesh trembles while she churns the blood."], "What do Odysseus\u2019s men do on the Island of the Sun?": [" They scream, they shriek; and groans and dismal sounds Stun my scared ears, and pierce hell\u2019s utmost bounds.

Now did the rosy-finger\u2019d morn arise, And shed her sacred light along the skies. Down to the haven and the ships in haste They bore the treasures, and in safety placed. The king himself the vases ranged with care; Then bade his followers to the feast prepare. A victim ox beneath the sacred hand Of great Alcinous falls, and stains the sand. To Jove the Eternal (power above all powers!

All, but Ulysses, heard with fix\u2019d delight; He sate, and eyed the sun, and wish\u2019d the night; Slow seem\u2019d the sun to move, the hours to roll, His native home deep-imaged in his soul. As the tired ploughman, spent with stubborn toil, Whose oxen long have torn the furrow\u2019d soil, Sees with delight the sun\u2019s declining ray, When home with feeble knees he bends his way To late repast (the day\u2019s hard labour done); So to Ulysses welcome set the sun; Then instant to Alcinous and the rest (The Scherian states) he turn\u2019d, and thus address\u2019d: \u201cO thou, the first in merit and command!", " Whate\u2019er the gods shall destine me to bear; In the black ocean or the watery war, \u2019Tis mine to master with a constant mind; Inured to perils, to the worst resign\u2019d, By seas, by wars, so many dangers run; Still I can suffer; their high will he done!\u201d Thus while he spoke, the beamy sun descends, And rising night her friendly shade extends, To the close grot the lonely pair remove, And slept delighted with the gifts of love. When rose morning call\u2019d them from their rest, Ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest. The nymph\u2019s fair head a veil transparent graced, Her swelling loins a radiant zone embraced With flowers of gold; an under robe, unbound, In snowy waves flow\u2019d glittering on the ground. Forth issuing thus, she gave him first to wield A weighty axe with truest temper steeled, And double-edged; the handle smooth and plain, Wrought of the clouded olive\u2019s easy grain; And next, a wedge to drive with sweepy sway Then to the neighboring forest led the way. On the lone island\u2019s utmost verge there stood Of poplars, pine, and firs, a lofty wood, Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire, Scorch\u2019d by the sun, or seared by heavenly fire (Already dried). These pointing out to view, The nymph just show\u2019d him, and with tears withdrew. Now toils the hero: trees on trees o\u2019erthrown Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan: Sudden, full twenty on the plain are strow\u2019d, And lopp\u2019d and lighten\u2019d of their branchy load.", " An ell in length the pliant wisp I weaved, And the huge body on my shoulders heaved: Then leaning on my spear with both my hands, Upbore my load, and press\u2019d the sinking sands With weighty steps, till at the ship I threw The welcome burden, and bespoke my crew: \u201c\u2018Cheer up, my friends! it is not yet our fate To glide with ghosts through Pluto\u2019s gloomy gate. Food in the desert land, behold! is given!

Here let us think (if thinking be not vain) If any counsel, any hope remain. Alas! from yonder promontory\u2019s brow I view\u2019d the coast, a region flat and low; An isle encircled with the boundless flood; A length of thickets, and entangled wood. Some smoke I saw amid the forest rise, And all around it only seas and skies!\u2019 \u201cWith broken hearts my sad companions stood, Mindful of Cyclops and his human food, And horrid Laestrygons, the men of blood."], "What does Poseidon ask Zeus?": [" Neritus, Ithacus, Polyctor, there, In sculptured stone immortalized their care, In marble urns received it from above, And shaded with a green surrounding grove; Where silver alders, in high arches twined, Drink the cool stream, and tremble to the wind.

To beg, than work, he better understands, Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands. For any office could the slave be good, To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food.

Of his own fortunes, and Ulysses\u2019 fame, Much ask\u2019d the seniors; till Peiraeus came. The stranger-guest pursued him close behind; Whom when Telemachus beheld, he join\u2019d. He (when Peiraeus ask\u2019d for slaves to bring The gifts and treasures of the Spartan king) Thus thoughtful answer\u2019d: \u201cThose we shall not move, Dark and unconscious of the will of Jove; We know not yet the full event of all: Stabb\u2019d in his palace if your prince must fall, Us, and our house, if treason must o\u2019erthrow, Better a friend possess them than a foe; If death to these, and vengeance Heaven decree, Riches are welcome then, not else, to me.", " And but augment the wrongs thou would\u2019st redress, Telemachus may bid the queen repair To great Icarius, whose paternal care Will guide her passion, and reward her choice With wealthy dower, and bridal gifts of price. Till she retires, determined we remain, And both the prince and augur threat in vain: His pride of words, and thy wild dream of fate, Move not the brave, or only move their hate, Threat on, O prince! elude the bridal day. Threat on, till all thy stores in waste decay. True, Greece affords a train of lovely dames, In wealth and beauty worthy of our flames: But never from this nobler suit we cease; For wealth and beauty less than virtue please.\u201d To whom the youth: \u201cSince then in vain I tell My numerous woes, in silence let them dwell. But Heaven, and all the Greeks, have heard my wrongs; To Heaven, and all the Greeks, redress belongs; Yet this I ask (nor be it ask\u2019d in vain), A bark to waft me o\u2019er the rolling main, The realms of Pyle and Sparta to explore, And seek my royal sire from shore to shore; If, or to fame his doubtful fate be known, Or to be learn\u2019d from oracles alone, If yet he lives, with patience I forbear, Till the fleet hours restore the circling year; But if already wandering in the train Of empty shades, I measure back the main, Plant the fair column o\u2019er the mighty dead, And yield his consort to the nuptial bed.\u201d He ceased; and while abash\u2019d the peers attend, Mentor arose, Ulysses\u2019 faithful friend: (When fierce in arms he sought the scenes of war, \u201cMy friend (he cried), my palace be thy care; Years roll\u2019d on years my godlike sire decay, Guard thou his age, and his behests obey.\u201d) Stern as he rose, he cast his eyes around, That flash\u2019d with rage; and as spoke, he frown\u2019d, \u201cO never, never more let king be just, Be mild in power, or faithful to his trust!"], "What does Athena do to help Odysseus in Ithaca?": [" So fell Aegysthus; and mayest thou, my friend, (On whom the virtues of thy sire descend,) Make future times thy equal act adore, And be what brave Orestes was before!\u201d The prudent youth replied: \u201cO thou the grace And lasting glory of the Grecian race! Just was the vengeance, and to latest days Shall long posterity resound the praise. Some god this arm with equal prowess bless! And the proud suitors shall its force confess; Injurious men! who while my soul is sore Of fresh affronts, are meditating more. But Heaven denies this honour to my hand, Nor shall my father repossess the land; The father\u2019s fortune never to return, And the sad son\u2019s to softer and to mourn!\u201d Thus he; and Nestor took the word: \u201cMy son, Is it then true, as distant rumours run, That crowds of rivals for thy mother\u2019s charms Thy palace fill with insults and alarms? Say, is the fault, through tame submission, thine? Or leagued against thee, do thy people join, Moved by some oracle, or voice divine? And yet who knows, but ripening lies in fate An hour of vengeance for the afflicted state; When great Ulysses shall suppress these harms, Ulysses singly, or all Greece in arms.

Ulysses takes his leave of Alcinous and Arete, and embarks in the evening. Next morning the ship arrives at Ithaca; where the sailors, as Ulysses is yet sleeping, lay him on the shore with all his treasures. On their return, Neptune changes their ship into a rock. In the meantime Ulysses, awaking, knows not his native Ithaca, by reason of a mist which Pallas had cast around him. He breaks into loud lamentations; till the goddess appearing to him in the form of a shepherd, discovers the country to him, and points out the particular places. He then tells a feigned story of his adventures, upon which she manifests herself, and they consult together of the measures to be taken to destroy the suitors. To conceal his return, and disguise his person the more effectually, she changes him into the figure of an old beggar. He ceased; but left so pleasing on their ear His voice, that listening still they seem\u2019d to hear. A pause of silence hush\u2019d the shady rooms: The grateful conference then the king resumes: \u201cWhatever toils the great Ulysses pass\u2019d, Beneath this happy roof they end at last; No longer now from shore to shore to roam, Smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home.", " The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon."], "What does Athena warn Telemachus of in his dreams?": [" Worn as I am with griefs, with care decay\u2019d, Never, I never scene so dire survey\u2019d! My shivering blood, congeal\u2019d, forgot to flow; Aghast I stood, a monument of woe! \u201cNow from the rocks the rapid vessel flies, And the hoarse din like distant thunder dies; To Sol\u2019s bright isle our voyage we pursue, And now the glittering mountains rise to view. There, sacred to the radiant god of day, Graze the fair herds, the flocks promiscuous stray: Then suddenly was heard along the main To low the ox, to blest the woolly train. Straight to my anxious thoughts the sound convey\u2019d The words of Circe and the Theban shade; Warn\u2019d by their awful voice these shores to shun, With cautious fears oppress\u2019d I thus begun: \u201c\u2018O friends! O ever exorcised in care! Hear Heaven\u2019s commands, and reverence what ye hear! To fly these shores the prescient Theban shade And Circe warn! Oh be their voice obey\u2019d Some mighty woe relentless Heaven forebodes: Fly these dire regions, and revere the gods!\u2019 \u201cWhile yet I spoke, a sudden sorrow ran Through every breast, and spread from man to man, Till wrathful thus Eurylochus began: \u201c\u2018O cruel thou! some Fury sure has steel\u2019d That stubborn soul, by toil untaught to yield! From sleep debarr\u2019d, we sink from woes to woes: And cruel\u2019 enviest thou a short repose? Still must we restless rove, new seas explore, The sun descending, and so near the shore? And lo! the night begins her groomy reign, And doubles all the terrors of the main: Oft in the dead of night loud winds rise, Lash the wild surge, and bluster in the skies.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.

The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care.

Meantime Minerva, from the fraudful horse, Back to the court of Priam bent your course.\u201d \u201cInclement fate! (Telemachus replies,) Frail is the boasted attribute of wise: The leader mingling with the vulgar host, Is in the common mass of matter lost! But now let sleep the painful waste repair Of sad reflection and corroding care.\u201d He ceased; the menial fair that round her wait, At Helen\u2019s beck prepare the room of state; Beneath an ample portico they spread The downy fleece to form the slumberous bed; And o\u2019er soft palls of purple grain unfold Rich tapestry, stiff with interwoven gold: Then, through the illumined dome, to balmy rest The obsequious herald guides each princely guest; While to his regal bower the king ascends, And beauteous Helen on her lord attends. Soon as the morn, in orient purple dress\u2019d, Unbarr\u2019d the portal of the roseate east, The monarch rose; magnificent to view, The imperial mantle o\u2019er his vest he threw; The glittering zone athwart his shoulders cast, A starry falchion low-depending graced; Clasp\u2019d on his feet the embroidered sandals shine; And forth he moves, majestic and divine, Instant to young Telemachus he press\u2019d; And thus benevolent his speech addressed: \u201cSay, royal youth, sincere of soul report Whit cause hath led you to the Spartan court?", " Nestor advises him to go to Sparta, and inquire further of Menelaus. The sacrifice ending with the night, Minerva vanishes from them in the form of an eagle: Telemachus is lodged in the palace. The next morning they sacrifice a bullock to Minerva; and Telemachus proceeds on his journey to Sparta, attended by Pisistratus. The scene lies on the sea-shore of Pylos. The sacred sun, above the waters raised, Through heaven\u2019s eternal brazen portals blazed; And wide o\u2019er earth diffused his cheering ray, To gods and men to give the golden day. Now on the coast of Pyle the vessel falls, Before old Neleus\u2019 venerable walls. There suppliant to the monarch of the flood, At nine green theatres the Pylians stood, Each held five hundred (a deputed train), At each, nine oxen on the sand lay slain. They taste the entrails, and the altars load With smoking thighs, an offering to the god. Full for the port the Ithacensians stand, And furl their sails, and issue on the land. Telemachus already press\u2019d the shore; Not first, the power of wisdom march\u2019d before, And ere the sacrificing throng he join\u2019d, Admonish\u2019d thus his well-attending mind: \u201cProceed, my son! this youthful shame expel; An honest business never blush to tell. To learn what fates thy wretched sire detain, We pass\u2019d the wide immeasurable main. Meet then the senior far renown\u2019d for sense With reverend awe, but decent confidence: Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies; And sure he will; for wisdom never lies.\u201d \u201cOh tell me, Mentor!", " Jove and Jove\u2019s daughter first implore in prayer, Then, whirling high, discharge thy lance in air.\u201d She said, infusing courage with the word. Jove and Jove\u2019s daughter then the chief implored, And, whirling high, dismiss\u2019d the lance in air. Full at Eupithes drove the deathful spear: The brass-cheek\u2019d helmet opens to the wound; He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound. Before the father and the conquering son Heaps rush on heaps, they fight, they drop, they run Now by the sword, and now the javelin, fall The rebel race, and death had swallow\u2019d all; But from on high the blue-eyed virgin cried; Her awful voice detain\u2019d the headlong tide: \u201cForbear, ye nations, your mad hands forbear From mutual slaughter; Peace descends to spare.\u201d Fear shook the nations: at the voice divine They drop their javelins, and their rage resign. All scatter\u2019d round their glittering weapons lie; Some fall to earth, and some confusedly fly. With dreadful shouts Ulysses pour\u2019d along, Swift as an eagle, as an eagle strong. But Jove\u2019s red arm the burning thunder aims: Before Minerva shot the livid flames; Blazing they fell, and at her feet expired; Then stopped the goddess, trembled and retired. \u201cDescended from the gods! Ulysses, cease; Offend not Jove: obey, and give the peace.\u201d So Pallas spoke: the mandate from above The king obey\u2019d. The virgin-seed of Jove, In Mentor\u2019s form, confirm\u2019d the full accord, And willing nations knew their lawful lord.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.

ARGUMENT. Telemachus returning to the city, relates to Penelope the sum of his travels. Ulysses is conducted by Eumaeus to the palace, where his old dog Argus acknowledges his master, after an absence of twenty years, and dies with joy. Eumaeus returns into the country, and Ulysses remains among the suitors, whose behaviour is described. Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Sprinkled with roseate light the dewy lawn, In haste the prince arose, prepared to part; His hand impatient grasps the pointed dart; Fair on his feet the polish\u2019d sandals shine, And thus he greets the master of the swine: \u201cMy friend, adieu! let this short stay suffice; I haste to meet my mother\u2019s longing eyes, And end her tears, her sorrows and her sighs. But thou, attentive, what we order heed: This hapless stranger to the city lead: By public bounty let him there be fed, And bless the hand that stretches forth the bread. To wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes, My will may covet, but my power denies. If this raise anger in the stranger\u2019s thought, The pain of anger punishes the fault: The very truth I undisguised declare; For what so easy as to be sincere?\u201d To this Ulysses: \u201cWhat the prince requires Of swift removal, seconds my desires. To want like mine the peopled town can yield More hopes of comfort than the lonely field: Nor fits my age to till the labour\u2019d lands, Or stoop to tasks a rural lord demands.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.

Then, turning short, disdain\u2019d a further stay; But to the palace measured back the way. There, as he rested gathering in a ring, The peers with smiles address\u2019d their unknown king: \u201cStranger, may Jove and all the aerial powers With every blessing crown thy happy hours!

Fast by his father\u2019s side he takes his stand: The beamy javelin lightens in his hand. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT. THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS. Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor.

Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god.

Phoebus, assist! nor be the labour vain.\u201d Swift as the word the parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings: Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!", " Before him instant was the banquet spread, And the bright basket piled with loaves of bread. Next came Ulysses lowly at the door, A figure despicable, old, and poor. In squalid vests, with many a gaping rent, Propp\u2019d or a staff, and trembling as he went. Then, resting on the threshold of the gate, Against a cypress pillar lean\u2019d his weight Smooth\u2019d by the workman to a polish\u2019d plane); The thoughtful son beheld, and call\u2019d his swain \u201cThese viands, and this bread, Eumaeus! bear, And let yon mendicant our plenty share: And let him circle round the suitors\u2019 board, And try the bounty of each gracious lord. Bold let him ask, encouraged thus by me: How ill, alas! do want and shame agree!\u201d His lord\u2019s command the faithful servant bears: The seeming beggar answers with his prayers: \u201cBless\u2019d be Telemachus! in every deed Inspire him. Jove! in every wish succeed!\u201d This said, the portion from his son convey\u2019d With smiles receiving on his scrip he laid. Long has the minstrel swept the sounding wire, He fed, and ceased when silence held the lyre. Soon as the suitors from the banquet rose, Minerva prompts the man of mighty woes To tempt their bounties with a suppliant\u2019s art, And learn the generous from the ignoble heart (Not but his soul, resentful as humane, Dooms to full vengeance all the offending train); With speaking eyes, and voice of plaintive sound, Humble he moves, imploring all around.", " Nor will that hand to utmost need afford The smallest portion of a wasteful board, Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps, Yet starving want, amidst the riot, weeps.\u201d The haughty suitor with resentment burns, And, sourly smiling, this reply returns: \u201cTake that, ere yet thou quit this princely throng; And dumb for ever be thy slanderous tongue!\u201d He said, and high the whirling tripod flung. His shoulder-blade received the ungentle shock; He stood, and moved not, like a marble rock; But shook his thoughtful head, nor more complain\u2019d, Sedate of soul, his character sustain\u2019d, And inly form\u2019d revenge; then back withdrew: Before his feet the well fill\u2019d scrip he threw, And thus with semblance mild address\u2019d the crew: \u201cMay what I speak your princely minds approve, Ye peers and rivals in this noble love! Not for the hurt I grieve, but for the cause. If, when the sword our country\u2019s quarrel draws, Or if, defending what is justly dear, From Mars impartial some broad wound we bear, The generous motive dignifies the scar. But for mere want, how hard to suffer wrong! Want brings enough of other ills along! Yet, if injustice never be secure, If fiends revenge, and gods assert the poor, Death shall lay low the proud aggressor\u2019s head, And make the dust Antinous\u2019 bridal bed.\u201d \u201cPeace, wretch! and eat thy bread without offence (The suitor cried), or force shall drag thee hence, Scourge through the public street, and cast thee there, A mangled carcase for the hounds to tear.\u201d His furious deed the general anger moved, All, even the worst, condemn\u2019d; and some reproved.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS. The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses!

Fast by his father\u2019s side he takes his stand: The beamy javelin lightens in his hand. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT. THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS. Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy. Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver\u2019d deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew: \u201cOne venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes! yet remains to play; Another mark our arrow must attain. Phoebus, assist! nor be the labour vain.\u201d Swift as the word the parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings: Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!", " Meantime the suitors urge the prince\u2019s fate, And deathful arts employ the dire debate: When in his airy tour, the bird of Jove Truss\u2019d with his sinewy pounce a trembling dove; Sinister to their hope! This omen eyed Amphinomus, who thus presaging cried: \u201cThe gods from force and fraud the prince defend; O peers! the sanguinary scheme suspend: Your future thought let sable fate employ; And give the present hour to genial joy.\u201d From council straight the assenting peerage ceased, And in the dome prepared the genial feast. Disrobed, their vests apart in order lay, Then all with speed succinct the victims slay: With sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled, And the proud steer was on the marble spread. With fire prepared, they deal the morsels round, Wine, rosy-bright, the brimming goblets crown\u2019d, By sage Eumaeus borne; the purple tide Melanthius from an ample jar supplied: High canisters of bread Philaetius placed; And eager all devour the rich repast. Disposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat; A trivet table, and ignobler seat, The prince appoints; but to his sire assigns The tasteful inwards, and nectareous wines. \u201cPartake, my guest (he cried), without control The social feast, and drain the cheering bowl: Dread not the railer\u2019s laugh, nor ruffian\u2019s rage; No vulgar roof protects thy honour\u2019d age; This dome a refuge to thy wrongs shall be, From my great sire too soon devolved to me! Your violence and scorn, ye suitors, cease, Lest arms avenge the violated peace.\u201d Awed by the prince, so haughty, brave, and young, Rage gnaw\u2019d the lip, amazement chain\u2019d the tongue.", " The chief his order gives: the obedient band, With due observance wait the chief\u2019s command: With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind. Minerva calls; the ready gales obey With rapid speed to whirl them o\u2019er the sea. Crunus they pass\u2019d, next Chalcis roll\u2019d away, With thickening darkness closed the doubtful day; The silver Phaea\u2019s glittering rills they lost, And skimm\u2019d along by Elis\u2019 sacred coast. Then cautious through the rocky reaches wind, And turning sudden, shun the death design\u2019d. Meantime, the king, Eumaeus, and the rest, Sate in the cottage, at their rural feast: The banquet pass\u2019d, and satiate every man, To try his host, Ulysses thus began: \u201cYet one night more, my friends, indulge your guest; The last I purpose in your walls to rest: To-morrow for myself I must provide, And only ask your counsel, and a guide; Patient to roam the street, by hunger led, And bless the friendly hand that gives me bread. There in Ulysses\u2019 roof I may relate Ulysses\u2019 wanderings to his royal mate; Or, mingling with the suitors\u2019 haughty train, Not undeserving some support obtain. Hermes to me his various gifts imparts. Patron of industry and manual arts: Few can with me in dexterous works contend, The pyre to build, the stubborn oak to rend; To turn the tasteful viand o\u2019er the flame; Or foam the goblet with a purple stream. Such are the tasks of men of mean estate, Whom fortune dooms to serve the rich and great.\u201d \u201cAlas!", " The queen awakes, deliver\u2019d of her woes; With florid joy her heart dilating glows: The vision, manifest of future fate, Makes her with hope her son\u2019s arrival wait. Meantime the suitors plough the watery plain, Telemachus in thought already slain! When sight of lessening Ithaca was lost Their sail directed for the Samian coast A small but verdant isle appear\u2019d in view, And Asteris the advancing pilot knew; An ample port the rocks projected form, To break the rolling waves and ruffling storm: That safe recess they gain with happy speed, And in close ambush wait the murderous deed. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of Ulysses in the Island of Calypso: whereupon Mercury is sent to command his removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents with much difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, in which he embarks. Neptune overtakes him with a terrible tempest, in which he is shipwrecked, and in the last danger of death; till Lencothea, a sea-goddess, assists him, and, after innumerable perils, he gets ashore on Phaeacia. The saffron morn, with early blushes spread, Now rose refulgent from Tithonus\u2019 bed; With new-born day to gladden mortal sight, And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light. Then met the eternal synod of the sky, Before the god, who thunders from on high, Supreme in might, sublime in majesty."], "Why does Telemachus want the gifts from Menelaus to be kept outside the palace?": [" There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS. The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal\u2019d his eyes: Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress\u2019d, And all thy fortunes roll\u2019d within his breast.", " To Pherae now, Diocleus\u2019 stately seat (Of Alpheus\u2019 race), the weary youths retreat. His house affords the hospitable rite, And pleased they sleep (the blessing of the night). But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, With rosy lustre purpled o\u2019er the lawn, Again they mount, their journey to renew, And from the sounding portico they flew. Along the waving fields their way they hold The fields receding as their chariot roll\u2019d; Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light, And o\u2019er the shaded landscape rush\u2019d the night. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS. Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably received by Menelaus to whom he relates the cause of his coming, and learns from him many particulars of what befell the Greeks since the destruction of Troy. He dwells more at large upon the prophecies of Proteus to him in his return; from which he acquaints Telemachus that Ulysses is detained in the island of Calypso. In the meantime the suitors consult to destroy Telemachus on the voyage home. Penelope is apprised of this; but comforted in a dream by Pallas, in the shape of her sister Iphthima. And now proud Sparta with their wheels resounds, Sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds; At the fair dome the rapid labour ends; Where sate Atrides \u2019midst his bridal friends, With double vows invoking Hymen\u2019s power, To bless his son\u2019s and daughter\u2019s nuptial hour.", " Nestor advises him to go to Sparta, and inquire further of Menelaus. The sacrifice ending with the night, Minerva vanishes from them in the form of an eagle: Telemachus is lodged in the palace. The next morning they sacrifice a bullock to Minerva; and Telemachus proceeds on his journey to Sparta, attended by Pisistratus. The scene lies on the sea-shore of Pylos. The sacred sun, above the waters raised, Through heaven\u2019s eternal brazen portals blazed; And wide o\u2019er earth diffused his cheering ray, To gods and men to give the golden day. Now on the coast of Pyle the vessel falls, Before old Neleus\u2019 venerable walls. There suppliant to the monarch of the flood, At nine green theatres the Pylians stood, Each held five hundred (a deputed train), At each, nine oxen on the sand lay slain. They taste the entrails, and the altars load With smoking thighs, an offering to the god. Full for the port the Ithacensians stand, And furl their sails, and issue on the land. Telemachus already press\u2019d the shore; Not first, the power of wisdom march\u2019d before, And ere the sacrificing throng he join\u2019d, Admonish\u2019d thus his well-attending mind: \u201cProceed, my son! this youthful shame expel; An honest business never blush to tell. To learn what fates thy wretched sire detain, We pass\u2019d the wide immeasurable main. Meet then the senior far renown\u2019d for sense With reverend awe, but decent confidence: Urge him with truth to frame his fair replies; And sure he will; for wisdom never lies.\u201d \u201cOh tell me, Mentor!", " The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the Island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. The man for wisdom\u2019s various arts renown\u2019d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray\u2019d, Their manners noted, and their states survey\u2019d, On stormy seas unnumber\u2019d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom\u2019d them never more (Ah, men unbless\u2019d!)"], "How do the other suitors greet the disguised Odysseus?": [" Go bathe, and robed in white ascend the towers; With all thy handmaids thank the immortal powers; To every god vow hecatombs to bleed. And call Jove\u2019s vengeance on their guilty deed. While to the assembled council I repair: A stranger sent by Heaven attends me there; My new accepted guest I haste to find, Now to Peiraeus\u2019 honour\u2019d charge consign\u2019d.\u201d The matron heard, nor was his word in vain. She bathed; and, robed in white, with all her train, To every god vow\u2019d hecatombs to bleed, And call\u2019d Jove\u2019s vengeance on the guilty deed, Arm\u2019d with his lance, the prince then pass\u2019d the gate, Two dogs behind, a faithful guard, await; Pallas his form with grace divine improves: The gazing crowd admires him as he moves. Him, gathering round, the haughty suitors greet With semblance fair, but inward deep deceit, Their false addresses, generous, he denied. Pass\u2019d on, and sate by faithful Mentor\u2019s side; With Antiphus, and Halitherses sage (His father\u2019s counsellors, revered for age). Of his own fortunes, and Ulysses\u2019 fame, Much ask\u2019d the seniors; till Peiraeus came. The stranger-guest pursued him close behind; Whom when Telemachus beheld, he join\u2019d. He (when Peiraeus ask\u2019d for slaves to bring The gifts and treasures of the Spartan king) Thus thoughtful answer\u2019d: \u201cThose we shall not move, Dark and unconscious of the will of Jove; We know not yet the full event of all: Stabb\u2019d in his palace if your prince must fall, Us, and our house, if treason must o\u2019erthrow, Better a friend possess them than a foe; If death to these, and vengeance Heaven decree, Riches are welcome then, not else, to me.", " By woman here thou tread\u2019st this mournful strand, And Greece by woman lies a desert land.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Warn\u2019d by my ills beware, (the shade replies,) Nor trust the sex that is so rarely wise; When earnest to explore thy secret breast, Unfold some trifle, but conceal the rest. But in thy consort cease to fear a foe, For thee she feels sincerity of woe; When Troy first bled beneath the Grecian arms, She shone unrivall\u2019d with a blaze of charms; Thy infant son her fragrant bosom press\u2019d, Hung at her knee, or wanton\u2019d at her breast; But now the years a numerous train have ran; The blooming boy is ripen\u2019d into man; Thy eyes shall see him burn with noble fire, The sire shall bless his son, the son his sire; But my Orestes never met these eyes, Without one look the murder\u2019d father dies; Then from a wretched friend this wisdom learn, E\u2019en to thy queen disguised, unknown, return; For since of womankind so few are just, Think all are false, nor e\u2019en the faithful trust. \u201c\u2018But, say, resides my son in royal port, In rich Orchomenos, or Sparta\u2019s court?

Hard conflict! when calamity and age With vigorous youth, unknown to cares, engage! Yet, fearful of disgrace, to try the day Imperious hunger bids, and I obey; But swear, impartial arbiters of right, Swear to stand neutral, while we cope in fight.\u201d The peers assent: when straight his sacred head Telemachus upraised, and sternly said: \u201cStranger, if prompted to chastise the wrong Of this bold insolent, confide, be strong!

BOOK XVI. ARGUMENT. THE DISCOVERY OF ULYSSES TO TELEMACHUS. Telemachus arriving at the lodge of Eumaeus, sends him to carry Penelope the news of his return. Minerva appearing to Ulysses, commands him to discover himself to his son. The princes, who had lain in ambush to intercept Telemachus in his way, their project being defeated, return to Ithaca. Soon as the morning blush\u2019d along the plains, Ulysses, and the monarch of the swains, Awake the sleeping fires, their meals prepare, And forth to pasture send the bristly care. The prince\u2019s near approach the dogs descry, And fawning round his feet confess their joy. Their gentle blandishment the king survey\u2019d, Heard his resounding step, and instant said: \u201cSome well-known friend, Eumaeus, bends this way; His steps I hear; the dogs familiar play.\u201d While yet he spoke, the prince advancing drew Nigh to the lodge, and now appear\u2019d in view.", " Ill I deserved these haughty peers\u2019 disdain; Now let them comfort their dejected train, In sweet repast their present hour employ, Nor wait till evening for the genial joy: Then to the lute\u2019s soft voice prolong the night; Music, the banquet\u2019s most refined delight.\u201d He said, then gave a nod; and at the word Telemachus girds on his shining sword. Fast by his father\u2019s side he takes his stand: The beamy javelin lightens in his hand. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT. THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS. Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy. Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver\u2019d deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew: \u201cOne venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes! yet remains to play; Another mark our arrow must attain. Phoebus, assist! nor be the labour vain.\u201d Swift as the word the parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings: Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!", " \u201cMy following fates to thee, O king, are known, And the bright partner of thy royal throne. Enough: in misery can words avail? And what so tedious as a twice-told tale?\u201d BOOK XIII. ARGUMENT. THE ARRIVAL OF ULYSSES IN ITHACA. Ulysses takes his leave of Alcinous and Arete, and embarks in the evening. Next morning the ship arrives at Ithaca; where the sailors, as Ulysses is yet sleeping, lay him on the shore with all his treasures. On their return, Neptune changes their ship into a rock. In the meantime Ulysses, awaking, knows not his native Ithaca, by reason of a mist which Pallas had cast around him. He breaks into loud lamentations; till the goddess appearing to him in the form of a shepherd, discovers the country to him, and points out the particular places. He then tells a feigned story of his adventures, upon which she manifests herself, and they consult together of the measures to be taken to destroy the suitors. To conceal his return, and disguise his person the more effectually, she changes him into the figure of an old beggar. He ceased; but left so pleasing on their ear His voice, that listening still they seem\u2019d to hear. A pause of silence hush\u2019d the shady rooms: The grateful conference then the king resumes: \u201cWhatever toils the great Ulysses pass\u2019d, Beneath this happy roof they end at last; No longer now from shore to shore to roam, Smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS. The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal\u2019d his eyes: Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress\u2019d, And all thy fortunes roll\u2019d within his breast."], "How does Eurycleia recognize Odysseus?": [" Are thus by Jove who constant beg his aid With pious deed, and pure devotion, paid? He never dared defraud the sacred fane Of perfect hecatombs in order slain: There oft implored his tutelary power, Long to protract the sad sepulchral hour; That, form\u2019d for empire with paternal care, His realm might recognize an equal heir. O destined head! The pious vows are lost; His God forgets him on a foreign coast!\u2014 Perhaps, like thee, poor guest! in wanton pride The rich insult him, and the young deride!

Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon."], "What does Penelope resolve to do after her nightmare?": [" She hears, and at the word obedient flies.

The pleasing sounds each latent warrior warm\u2019d, But most Tydides\u2019 and coy heart alarm\u2019d: To quit the steed we both impatient press Threatening to answer from the dark recess.", " Then swelling sorrows burst their former bounds, With echoing grief afresh the dome resounds; Till Pallas, piteous of her plaintive cries, In slumber closed her silver-streaming eyes. Meantime, rekindled at the royal charms, Tumultuous love each beating bosom warms; Intemperate rage a wordy war began; But bold Telemachus assumed the man. \u201cInstant (he cried) your female discord end, Ye deedless boasters! and the song attend; Obey that sweet compulsion, nor profane With dissonance the smooth melodious strain.

Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. \u201cThis cannot be true, because it is not true; and that is not true, because it cannot be true.\u201d Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and oblivion. It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus. According to this document, the city of Cumae in AEolia was, at an early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS. The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal\u2019d his eyes: Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress\u2019d, And all thy fortunes roll\u2019d within his breast.", " when the Hours produce Their latent buds, and Sol exalts the juice.\u201d Smit with the signs which all his doubts explain, His heart within him melt; his knees sustain Their feeble weight no more: his arms alone Support him, round the loved Ulysses thrown; He faints, he sinks, with mighty joys oppress\u2019d: Ulysses clasps him to his eager breast. Soon as returning life regains its seat, And his breath lengthens, and his pulses beat: \u201cYes, I believe (he cries) almighty Jove! Heaven rules us yet, and gods there are above. \u2019Tis so\u2014the suitors for their wrongs have paid\u2014 But what shall guard us, if the town invade? If, while the news through every city flies, All Ithaca and Cephalenia rise?\u201d To this Ulysses: \u201cAs the gods shall please Be all the rest: and set thy soul at ease. Haste to the cottage by this orchard\u2019s side, And take the banquet which our cares provide; There wait thy faithful band of rural friends, And there the young Telemachus attends.\u201d Thus, having said, they traced the garden o\u2019er And stooping entered at the lowly door. The swains and young Telemachus they found. The victim portion\u2019d and the goblet crown\u2019d. The hoary king, his old Sicilian maid Perfum\u2019d and wash\u2019d, and gorgeously arrayed. Pallas attending gives his frame to shine With awful port, and majesty divine; His gazing son admires the godlike grace, And air celestial dawning o\u2019er his face. \u201cWhat god (he cried) my father\u2019s form improves!", " Of that heroic sire the youth is sprung, But modest awe hath chain\u2019d his timorous tongue. Thy voice, O king! with pleased attention heard, Is like the dictates of a god revered. With him, at Nestor\u2019s high command, I came, Whose age I honour with a parent\u2019s name. By adverse destiny constrained to sue For counsel and redress, he sues to you Whatever ill the friendless orphan bears, Bereaved of parents in his infant years, Still must the wrong\u2019d Telemachus sustain, If, hopeful of your aid, he hopes in vain; Affianced in your friendly power alone, The youth would vindicate the vacant throne.\u201d \u201cIs Sparta blest, and these desiring eyes View my friend\u2019s son?

I, to confirm the mutual joys we shared, For his abode a capital prepared; Argos, the seat of sovereign rule, I chose; Fair in the plan the future palace rose, Where my Ulysses and his race might reign, And portion to his tribes the wide domain, To them my vassals had resign\u2019d a soil, With teeming plenty to reward their toil. There with commutual zeal we both had strove In acts of dear benevolence and love: Brothers in peace, not rivals in command, And death alone dissolved the friendly band!"], "What does Theoclymenus interpret as a bad omen?": [" From him sprung Theoclymenus, who found (The sacred wine yet foaming on the ground) Telemachus: whom, as to Heaven he press\u2019d His ardent vows, the stranger thus address\u2019d: \u201cO thou! that dost thy happy course prepare With pure libations and with solemn prayer: By that dread power to whom thy vows are paid; By all the lives of these; thy own dear head, Declare sincerely to no foe\u2019s demand Thy name, thy lineage, and paternal land.\u201d \u201cPrepare, then (said Telemachus), to know A tale from falsehood free, not free from woe. From Ithaca, of royal birth I came, And great Ulysses (ever honour\u2019d name!) Once was my sire, though now, for ever lost, In Stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost! Whose fate inquiring through the world we rove; The last, the wretched proof of filial love.\u201d The stranger then: \u201cNor shall I aught conceal, But the dire secret of my fate reveal. Of my own tribe an Argive wretch I slew; Whose powerful friends the luckless deed pursue With unrelenting rage, and force from home The blood-stain\u2019d exile, ever doom\u2019d to roam. But bear, oh bear me o\u2019er yon azure flood; Receive the suppliant! spare my destined blood!\u201d \u201cStranger (replied the prince) securely rest Affianced in our faith; henceforth our guest.\u201d Thus affable, Ulysses\u2019 godlike heir Takes from the stranger\u2019s hand the glittering spear: He climbs the ship, ascends the stern with haste And by his side the guest accepted placed.", " No sailors there, no vessels to convey, No oars to cut the immeasurable way.\u2019 This told Atrides, and he told no more. Then safe I voyaged to my native shore.\u201d He ceased; nor made the pensive queen reply, But droop\u2019d her head, and drew a secret sigh. When Theoclymenus the seer began: \u201cO suffering consort of the suffering man! What human knowledge could, those kings might tell, But I the secrets of high heaven reveal. Before the first of gods be this declared, Before the board whose blessings we have shared; Witness the genial rites, and witness all This house holds sacred in her ample wall! E\u2019en now, this instant, great Ulysses, laid At rest, or wandering in his country\u2019s shade, Their guilty deeds, in hearing, and in view, Secret revolves; and plans the vengeance due. Of this sure auguries the gods bestow\u2019d, When first our vessel anchor\u2019d in your road.\u201d \u201cSucceed those omens, Heaven! (the queen rejoin\u2019d) So shall our bounties speak a grateful mind; And every envied happiness attend The man who calls Penelope his friend.\u201d Thus communed they: while in the marble court (Scene of their insolence) the lords resort: Athwart the spacious square each tries his art, To whirl the disk, or aim the missile dart. Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive, And from the field the victim flocks they drive: Medon the herald (one who pleased them best, And honour\u2019d with a portion of their feast), To bid the banquet, interrupts their play: Swift to the hall they haste; aside they lay Their garments, and succinct the victims slay.", " There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm\u2019d, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o\u2019er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den.

Down dropp\u2019d the caitiff-corse, a worthless load, Down to the deep; there roll\u2019d, the future food Of fierce sea-wolves, and monsters of the flood. An helpless infant I remain\u2019d behind; Thence borne to Ithaca by wave and wind; Sold to Laertes by divine command, And now adopted to a foreign land.\u201d To him the king: \u201cReciting thus thy cares, My secret soul in all thy sorrow shares; But one choice blessing (such is Jove\u2019s high will) Has sweeten\u2019d all thy bitter draught of ill: Torn from thy country to no hapless end, The gods have, in a master, given a friend. Whatever frugal nature needs is thine (For she needs little), daily bread and wine. While I, so many wanderings past, and woes, Live but on what thy poverty bestows.\u201d So passed in pleasing dialogue away The night; then down to short repose they lay; Till radiant rose the messenger of day. While in the port of Ithaca, the band Of young Telemachus approach\u2019d the land; Their sails they loosed, they lash\u2019d the mast aside, And cast their anchors, and the cables tied: Then on the breezy shore, descending, join In grateful banquet o\u2019er the rosy wine. When thus the prince: \u201cNow each his course pursue; I to the fields, and to the city you. Long absent hence, I dedicate this day My swains to visit, and the works survey. Expect me with the morn, to pay the skies Our debt of safe return in feast and sacrifice.\u201d Then Theoclymenus: \u201cBut who shall lend, Meantime, protection to thy stranger friend?"], "What is Penelope\u2019s challenge to the suitors?": [" She hears, and at the word obedient flies. With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes, He purged the walls, and blood-polluted rooms. Again the matron springs with eager pace, And spreads her lord\u2019s return from place to place. They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand, A gazing throng, a torch in every hand. They saw, they knew him, and with fond embrace Each humbly kiss\u2019d his knee, or hand, or face; He knows them all, in all such truth appears, E\u2019en he indulges the sweet joy of tears. BOOK XXIII. ARGUMENT. Euryclea awakens Penelope with the news of Ulysses\u2019 return, and the death of the suitors. Penelope scarcely credits her; but supposes some god has punished them, and descends from her department in doubt. At the first interview of Ulysses and Penelope, she is quite unsatisfied. Minerva restores him to the beauty of his youth; but the queen continues incredulous, till by some circumstances she is convinced, and falls into all the transports of passion and tenderness. They recount to each other all that has passed during their long separation. The next morning Ulysses, arming himself and his friends, goes from the city to visit his father. Then to the queen, as in repose she lay, The nurse with eager rapture speeds her way: The transports of her faithful heart supply A sudden youth, and give her wings to fly. \u201cAnd sleeps my child? (the reverend matron cries) Ulysses lives!", " The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the Island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song. Some words arise between the suitors and Telemachus, who summons the council to meet the day following. The man for wisdom\u2019s various arts renown\u2019d, Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray\u2019d, Their manners noted, and their states survey\u2019d, On stormy seas unnumber\u2019d toils he bore, Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day; The god vindictive doom\u2019d them never more (Ah, men unbless\u2019d!)", " Unguided hence my trembling steps I bend, Far hence, before yon hovering deaths descend; Lest the ripe harvest of revenge begun, I share the doom ye suitors cannot shun.\u201d This said, to sage Piraeus sped the seer, His honour\u2019d host, a welcome inmate there. O\u2019er the protracted feast the suitors sit, And aim to wound the prince with pointless wit: Cries one, with scornful leer and mimic voice, \u201cThy charity we praise, but not thy choice; Why such profusion of indulgence shown To this poor, timorous, toil-detesting drone? That others feeds on planetary schemes, And pays his host with hideous noon-day dreams. But, prince! for once at least believe a friend; To some Sicilian mart these courtiers send, Where, if they yield their freight across the main, Dear sell the slaves! demand no greater gain.\u201d Thus jovial they; but nought the prince replies; Full on his sire he roll\u2019d his ardent eyes: Impatient straight to flesh his virgin-sword; From the wise chief he waits the deathful word. Nigh in her bright alcove, the pensive queen To see the circle sate, of all unseen. Sated at length they rise, and bid prepare An eve-repast, with equal cost and care: But vengeful Pallas, with preventing speed, A feast proportion\u2019d to their crimes decreed; A feast of death, the feasters doom\u2019d to bleed! BOOK XXI. ARGUMENT. THE BENDING OF ULYSSES\u2019 BOW. Penelope, to put an end to the solicitation of the suitors, proposes to marry the person who shall first bend the bow of Ulysses, and shoot through the ringlets.", " and all the gods! (he cried), Thus from my walls and the much-loved son to send Of such a hero, and of such a friend! Me, as some needy peasant, would ye leave, Whom Heaven denies the blessing to relieve? Me would ye leave, who boast imperial sway, When beds of royal state invite your stay? No\u2014long as life this mortal shall inspire, Or as my children imitate their sire. Here shall the wandering stranger find his home, And hospitable rites adorn the dome.\u201d \u201cWell hast thou spoke (the blue-eyed maid replies), Beloved old man! benevolent as wise. Be the kind dictates of thy heart obey\u2019d, And let thy words Telemachus persuade: He to thy palace shall thy steps pursue; I to the ship, to give the orders due, Prescribe directions and confirm the crew. For I alone sustain their naval cares, Who boast experience from these silver hairs; All youths the rest, whom to this journey move Like years, like tempers, and their prince\u2019s love There in the vessel shall I pass the night; And, soon as morning paints the fields of light, I go to challenge from the Caucons bold A debt, contracted in the days of old, But this, thy guest, received with friendly care Let thy strong coursers swift to Sparta bear; Prepare thy chariot at the dawn of day, And be thy son companion of his way.\u201d Then, turning with the word, Minerva flies, And soars an eagle through the liquid skies. Vision divine! the throng\u2019d spectators gaze In holy wonder fix\u2019d, and still amaze."], "What does Odysseus promise to Eumaeus and Philoetius if they help him?": [" Then sheep, and goats, and bristly porkers bled, And the proud steer was o\u2019er the marble spread. While thus the copious banquet they provide, Along the road, conversing side by side, Proceed Ulysses and the faithful swain; When thus Eumaeus, generous and humane: \u201cTo town, observant of our lord\u2019s behest, Now let us speed; my friend no more my guest! Yet like myself I wish thee here preferr\u2019d, Guard of the flock, or keeper of the herd, But much to raise my master\u2019s wrath I fear; The wrath of princes ever is severe. Then heed his will, and be our journey made While the broad beams of Phoebus are display\u2019d, Or ere brown evening spreads her chilly shade.\u201d \u201cJust thy advice (the prudent chief rejoin\u2019d), And such as suits the dictate of my mind. Lead on: but help me to some staff to stay My feeble step, since rugged is the way.\u201d Across his shoulders then the scrip he flung, Wide-patch\u2019d, and fasten\u2019d by a twisted thong. A staff Eumaeus gave. Along the way Cheerly they fare: behind, the keepers stay: These with their watchful dogs (a constant guard) Supply his absence, and attend the herd. And now his city strikes the monarch\u2019s eyes, Alas! how changed! a man of miseries; Propp\u2019d on a staff, a beggar old and bare In rags dishonest fluttering with the air! Now pass\u2019d the rugged road, they journey down The cavern\u2019d way descending to the town, Where, from the rock, with liquid drops distils A limpid fount; that spread in parting rills Its current thence to serve the city brings; An useful work, adorn\u2019d by ancient kings.", " The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon.", " When hush\u2019d their passion, thus the goddess cries: \u2018Ulysses, taught by labours to be wise, Let this short memory of grief suffice. To me are known the various woes ye bore. In storms by sea, in perils on the shore; Forget whatever was in Fortune\u2019s power, And share the pleasures of this genial hour. Such be your mind as ere ye left your coast, Or learn\u2019d to sorrow for a country lost. Exiles and wanderers now, where\u2019er ye go, Too faithful memory renews your woe: The cause removed, habitual griefs remain, And the soul saddens by the use of pain.\u2019 \u201cHer kind entreaty moved the general breast; Tired with long toil, we willing sunk to rest. We plied the banquet, and the bowl we crown\u2019d, Till the full circle of the year came round. But when the seasons following in their train, Brought back the months, the days, and hours again; As from a lethargy at once they rise, And urge their chief with animating cries: \u201c\u2018Is this, Ulysses, our inglorious lot? And is the name of Ithaca forgot? Shall never the dear land in prospect rise, Or the loved palace glitter in our eyes? \u201cMelting I heard; yet till the sun\u2019s decline Prolong\u2019d the feast, and quaff\u2019d the rosy wine But when the shades came on at evening hour, And all lay slumbering in the dusky bower, I came a suppliant to fair Circe\u2019s bed, The tender moment seized, and thus I said: \u2018Be mindful, goddess! of thy promise made; Must sad Ulysses ever be delay\u2019d?", " Transported from his seat Eumaeus sprung, Dropp\u2019d the full bowl, and round his bosom hung; Kissing his cheek, his hand, while from his eye The tears rain\u2019d copious in a shower of joy, As some fond sire who ten long winters grieves, From foreign climes an only son receives (Child of his age), with strong paternal joy, Forward he springs, and clasps the favourite boy: So round the youth his arms Eumaeus spread, As if the grave had given him from the dead. \u201cAnd is it thou? my ever-dear delight! Oh, art thou come to bless my longing sight? Never, I never hoped to view this day, When o\u2019er the waves you plough\u2019d the desperate way. Enter, my child! Beyond my hopes restored, Oh give these eyes to feast upon their lord. Enter, oh seldom seen! for lawless powers Too much detain thee from these sylvan bowers,\u201d The prince replied: \u201cEumaeus, I obey; To seek thee, friend, I hither took my way. But say, if in the court the queen reside Severely chaste, or if commenced a bride?\u201d Thus he; and thus the monarch of the swains: \u201cSeverely chaste Penelope remains; But, lost to every joy, she wastes the day In tedious cares, and weeps the night away.\u201d He ended, and (receiving as they pass The javelin pointed with a star of brass), They reach\u2019d the dome; the dome with marble shined. His seat Ulysses to the prince resign\u2019d. \u201cNot so (exclaims the prince with decent grace) For me, this house shall find an humbler place: To usurp the honours due to silver hairs And reverend strangers modest youth forbears.\u201d Instant the swain the spoils of beasts supplies, And bids the rural throne with osiers rise."], "What do the suitors initially think when Odysseus shoots Antinous?": [" Ill I deserved these haughty peers\u2019 disdain; Now let them comfort their dejected train, In sweet repast their present hour employ, Nor wait till evening for the genial joy: Then to the lute\u2019s soft voice prolong the night; Music, the banquet\u2019s most refined delight.\u201d He said, then gave a nod; and at the word Telemachus girds on his shining sword. Fast by his father\u2019s side he takes his stand: The beamy javelin lightens in his hand. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT. THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS. Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy. Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver\u2019d deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew: \u201cOne venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes! yet remains to play; Another mark our arrow must attain. Phoebus, assist! nor be the labour vain.\u201d Swift as the word the parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings: Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!", " For me, suffice the approbation won Of my great mistress, and her godlike son.\u201d To him Telemachus: \u201cNo more incense The man by nature prone to insolence: Injurious minds just answers but provoke\u201d\u2014 Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke: \u201cThanks to thy care! whose absolute command Thus drives the stranger from our court and land. Heaven bless its owner with a better mind! From envy free, to charity inclined. This both Penelope and I afford: Then, prince! be bounteous of Ulysses\u2019 board. To give another\u2019s is thy hand so slow? So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow?\u201d \u201cWhence, great Telemachus! this lofty strain? (Antinous cries with insolent disdain): Portions like mine if every suitor gave, Our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave.\u201d He spoke, and lifting high above the board His ponderous footstool, shook it at his lord. The rest with equal hand conferr\u2019d the bread: He fill\u2019d his scrip, and to the threshold sped; But first before Antinous stopp\u2019d, and said: \u201cBestow, my friend! thou dost not seem the worst Of all the Greeks, but prince-like and the first; Then, as in dignity, be first in worth, And I shall praise thee through the boundless earth. Once I enjoy\u2019d in luxury of state Whate\u2019er gives man the envied name of great; Wealth, servants, friends, were mine in better days And hospitality was then my praise; In every sorrowing soul I pour\u2019d delight, And poverty stood smiling in my sight.", " \u201cRelate (Antinous cries), devoid of guile, When spread the prince his sale for distant Pyle? Did chosen chiefs across the gulfy main Attend his voyage, or domestic train? Spontaneous did you speed his secret course, Or was the vessel seized by fraud or force?\u201d \u201cWith willing duty, not reluctant mind (Noemon cried), the vessel was resign\u2019d, Who, in the balance, with the great affairs Of courts presume to weigh their private cares? With him, the peerage next in power to you; And Mentor, captain of the lordly crew, Or some celestial in his reverend form, Safe from the secret rock and adverse storm, Pilot\u2019s the course; for when the glimmering ray Of yester dawn disclosed the tender day, Mentor himself I saw, and much admired,\u201d Then ceased the youth, and from the court retired. Confounded and appall\u2019d, the unfinish\u2019d game The suitors quit, and all to council came. Antinous first the assembled peers address\u2019d. Rage sparkling in his eyes, and burning in his breast \u201cO shame to manhood! shall one daring boy The scheme of all our happiness destroy? Fly unperceived, seducing half the flower Of nobles, and invite a foreign power? The ponderous engine raised to crush us all, Recoiling, on his head is sure to fall. Instant prepare me, on the neighbouring strand, With twenty chosen mates a vessel mann\u2019d; For ambush\u2019d close beneath the Samian shore His ship returning shall my spies explore; He soon his rashness shall with life atone, Seek for his father\u2019s fate, but find his own.\u201d With vast applause the sentence all approve; Then rise, and to the feastful hall remove; Swift to the queen the herald Medon ran, Who heard the consult of the dire divan: Before her dome the royal matron stands, And thus the message of his haste demands; \u201cWhat will the suitors?", " After their attempts have proved ineffectual, Ulysses, taking Eumaeus and Philaetius apart, discovers himself to them; then returning, desires leave to try his strength at the bow, which, though refused with indignation by the suitors, Penelope and Telemachus cause it to be delivered to his hands.

The king alternate a dire tale relates, Of wars, of triumphs, and disastrous fates; All he unfolds; his listening spouse turns pale With pleasing horror at the dreadful tale; Sleepless devours each word; and hears how slain Cicons on Cicons swell the ensanguined plain; How to the land of Lote unbless\u2019d he sails; And images the rills and flowery vales! How dash\u2019d like dogs, his friends the Cyclops tore (Not unrevenged), and quaff\u2019d the spouting gore; How the loud storms in prison bound, he sails From friendly Aeolus with prosperous gales: Yet fate withstands! a sudden tempest roars, And whirls him groaning from his native shores: How on the barbarous Laestrigonian coast, By savage hands his fleet and friends lie lost; How scarce himself survived: he paints the bower, The spells of Circe, and her magic power; His dreadful journey to the realms beneath, To seek Tiresias in the vales of death; How in the doleful mansions lie survey\u2019d His royal mother, pale Anticlea\u2019s shade; And friends in battle slain, heroic ghosts!", " Now sat Ulysses at the rural feast The rage of hunger and of thirst repress\u2019d: To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent: A son of Dolius on the message went, Stood in the way, and at a glance beheld The foe approach, embattled on the field. With backward step he hastens to the bower, And tells the news. They arm with all their power. Four friends alone Ulysses\u2019 cause embrace, And six were all the sons of Dolius\u2019 race: Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on; And, still more old, in arms Laertes shone. Trembling with warmth, the hoary heroes stand, And brazen panoply invests the band. The opening gates at once their war display: Fierce they rush forth: Ulysses leads the way. That moment joins them with celestial aid, In Mentor\u2019s form, the Jove-descended maid: The suffering hero felt his patient breast Swell with new joy, and thus his son address\u2019d: \u201cBehold, Telemachus!

(he cries,) The day that shows me, ere I close my eyes, A son and grandson of the Arcesian name Strive for fair virtue, and contest for fame!\u201d Then thus Minerva in Laertes\u2019 ear: \u201cSon of Arcesius, reverend warrior, hear!", " The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions.

For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca.

The golden wand, that causes sleep to fly, Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye, That drives the ghosts to realms of night or day, Points out the long uncomfortable way.", " And now Eumaeus, at the evening hour, Came late, returning to his sylvan bower. Ulysses and his son had dress\u2019d with art A yearling boar, and gave the gods their part. Holy repast! That instant from the skies The martial goddess to Ulysses flies: She waves her golden wand, and reassumes From every feature every grace that blooms; At once his vestures change; at once she sheds Age o\u2019er his limbs, that tremble as he treads: Lest to the queen the swain with transport fly, Unable to contain the unruly joy; When near he drew, the prince breaks forth: \u201cProclaim What tidings, friend? what speaks the voice of fame? Say, if the suitors measure back the main, Or still in ambush thirst for blood in vain?\u201d \u201cWhether (he cries) they measure back the flood, Or still in ambush thirst in vain for blood, Escaped my care: where lawless suitors sway, Thy mandate borne my soul disdain\u2019d to stay. But from the Hermaean height I cast a view, Where to the port a bark high-bounding flew; Her freight a shining band: with martial air Each poised his shield, and each advanced his spear; And, if aright these searching eyes survey, The eluded suitors stem the watery way.\u201d The prince, well pleased to disappoint their wiles, Steals on his sire a glance, and secret smiles. And now, a short repast prepared, they fed Till the keen rage of craving hunger fled: Then to repose withdrawn, apart they lay, And in soft sleep forgot the cares of day.", " The suitors endeavour to justify their stay, at least till he shall send the queen to the court of Icarius her father; which he refuses. There appears a prodigy of two eagles in the sky, which an augur expounds to the ruin of the suitors. Telemachus then demands a vessel to carry him to Pylos and Sparta, there to inquire of his father\u2019s fortunes. Pallas, in the shape of Mentor (an ancient friend of Ulysses), helps him to a ship, assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage, and embarks with him that night; which concludes the second day from the opening of the poem. The scene continues in the palace of Ulysses, in Ithaca. Now reddening from the dawn, the morning ray Glow\u2019d in the front of heaven, and gave the day The youthful hero, with returning light, Rose anxious from the inquietudes of night. A royal robe he wore with graceful pride, A two-edged falchion threaten\u2019d by his side, Embroider\u2019d sandals glitter\u2019d as he trod, And forth he moved, majestic as a god. Then by his heralds, restless of delay, To council calls the peers: the peers obey. Soon as in solemn form the assembly sate, From his high dome himself descends in state. Bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined; Two dogs, a faithful guard, attend behind; Pallas with grace divine his form improves, And gazing crowds admire him as he moves, His father\u2019s throne he fill\u2019d; while distant stood The hoary peers, and aged wisdom bow\u2019d.", " Ill I deserved these haughty peers\u2019 disdain; Now let them comfort their dejected train, In sweet repast their present hour employ, Nor wait till evening for the genial joy: Then to the lute\u2019s soft voice prolong the night; Music, the banquet\u2019s most refined delight.\u201d He said, then gave a nod; and at the word Telemachus girds on his shining sword. Fast by his father\u2019s side he takes his stand: The beamy javelin lightens in his hand. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT. THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS. Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy. Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver\u2019d deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew: \u201cOne venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes! yet remains to play; Another mark our arrow must attain. Phoebus, assist! nor be the labour vain.\u201d Swift as the word the parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings: Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul!"], "What happens to Odysseus at the end of The Odyssey?": [" A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf\u2019s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning. \u201cTo me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are nowise admissible.", " The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon.", " The creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.\u201d From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer an individual? or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets? Well has Landor remarked: \u201cSome tell us there were twenty Homers; some deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.\u201d But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysis, our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry details.", " There seems, therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old epics,\u2014the Thebais and the Cypria, as well as the Iliad and the Odyssey,\u2014began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century B.C. I; and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it: so that before the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodies.\u201d But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations:\u2014 \u201cThere are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion, throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid compilation, at least over the theory that the Iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the fame, and the faint echo; if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain."]}
