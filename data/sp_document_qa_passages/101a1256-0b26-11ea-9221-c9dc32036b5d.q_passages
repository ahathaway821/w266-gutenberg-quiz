For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song.", " The next morning they sacrifice a bullock to Minerva; and Telemachus proceeds on his journey to Sparta, attended by Pisistratus. The scene lies on the sea-shore of Pylos.

Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the Homeric age; however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age; however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics:\u2014still it is difficult to suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression.", " Less soft my feature less august my frame?

He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon.", " Hence with those coward terms; or fight or fly; This choice is left you, to resist or die: And die I trust ye shall.\u201d He sternly spoke: With guilty fears the pale assembly shook.

O let me, let me not thine anger move, That I forbore, thus, thus to speak my love: Thus in fond kisses, while the transport warms Pour out my soul and die within thine arms! I dreaded fraud! Men, faithless men, betray Our easy faith, and make our sex their prey: Against the fondness of my heart I strove: \u2019Twas caution, O my lord! not want of love.

Once I was strong (would Heaven restore those days!) And with my betters claim\u2019d a share of praise. Ulysses, Menelaus, led forth a band, And join\u2019d me with them (\u2019twas their own command); A deathful ambush for the foe to lay, Beneath Troy walls by night we took our way: There, clad in arms, along the marshes spread, We made the osier-fringed bank our bed. Full soon the inclemency of heaven I feel, Nor had these shoulders covering, but of steel. Sharp blew the north; snow whitening all the fields Froze with the blast, and gathering glazed our shields. There all but I, well fenced with cloak and vest, Lay cover\u2019d by their ample shields at rest. Fool that I was! I left behind my own, The skill of weather and of winds unknown, And trusted to my coat and shield alone!

The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed. If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C.", " These loose songs were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about Peisistratus\u2019 time, about five hundred years after.\u201d Two French writers\u2014Hedelin and Perrault\u2014avowed a similar scepticism on the subject; but it is in the \u201cScienza Nuova\u201d of Battista Vico, that we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:\u2014 \u201cHalf a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf, turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ.", " No vessel happened then to be setting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythrae, a town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable. At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in Phocaea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure, which we will continue in the words of our author. \u201cHaving set out from Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus (for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer.", " As the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung, Or parent vulture, mourns her ravish\u2019d young; They cry, they scream, their unfledged brood a prey To some rude churl, and borne by stealth away: So they aloud: and tears in tides had run, Their grief unfinish\u2019d with the setting sun; But checking the full torrent in its flow, The prince thus interrupts the solemn woe. \u201cWhat ship transported thee, O father, say; And what bless\u2019d hands have oar\u2019d thee on the way?\u201d \u201cAll, all (Ulysses instant made reply), I tell thee all, my child, my only joy!

Stratius and Echephron the victim led; The axe was held by warlike Thrasymed, In act to strike; before him Perseus stood, The vase extending to receive the blood. The king himself initiates to the power: Scatters with quivering hand the sacred flour, And the stream sprinkles; from the curling brows The hair collected in the fire he throws. Soon as due vows on every part were paid, And sacred wheat upon the victim laid, Strong Thrasymed discharged the speeding blow Full on his neck, and cut the nerves in two.

If the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach of observation.

Was Homer an individual? or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?", " As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf\u2019s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning.", " To him, to me, one common lot was given, In equal woes, alas! involved by Heaven.

He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own.

Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy.

MINERVA\u2019S DESCENT TO ITHACA. The poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of Ulysses in his dominions. He had now remained seven years in the Island of Calypso, when the gods assembled in council, proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country. For this purpose it is concluded to send Mercury to Calypso, and Pallas immediately descends to Ithaca. She holds a conference with Telemachus, in the shape of Mantes, king of Taphians; in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father Ulysses, to Pylos and Sparta, where Nestor and Menelaus yet reigned; then, after having visibly displayed her divinity, disappears. The suitors of Penelope make great entertainments, and riot in her palace till night. Phemius sings to them the return of the Grecians, till Penelope puts a stop to the song.", " When rose morning call\u2019d them from their rest, Ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest. The nymph\u2019s fair head a veil transparent graced, Her swelling loins a radiant zone embraced With flowers of gold; an under robe, unbound, In snowy waves flow\u2019d glittering on the ground. Forth issuing thus, she gave him first to wield A weighty axe with truest temper steeled, And double-edged; the handle smooth and plain, Wrought of the clouded olive\u2019s easy grain; And next, a wedge to drive with sweepy sway Then to the neighboring forest led the way. On the lone island\u2019s utmost verge there stood Of poplars, pine, and firs, a lofty wood, Whose leafless summits to the skies aspire, Scorch\u2019d by the sun, or seared by heavenly fire (Already dried).

Now toils the hero: trees on trees o\u2019erthrown Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan: Sudden, full twenty on the plain are strow\u2019d, And lopp\u2019d and lighten\u2019d of their branchy load."], "What will be the long-term result of Odysseus\u2019s use of wits rather than brute strength?": [" Hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes, which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poet\u2019s meaning, his words were less jealously sought for, and those who could read so good a poem as Pope\u2019s Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied.", " But it is one thing to _use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result? A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions\u2014nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be some grand pervading principle\u2014some invisible, yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy; we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will require little acuteness to detect.", " Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former.

The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf\u2019s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning.", " a man of miseries!

ARGUMENT. THE DESCENT INTO HELL. Ulysses continues his narration. How he arrived at the land of the Cimmerians, and what ceremonies he performed to invoke the dead. The manner of his descent, and the apparition of the shades: his conversation with Elpenor, and with Tiresias, who informs him in a prophetic manner of his fortunes to come. He meets his mother Anticles, from whom he learns the state of his family. He sees the shades of the ancient heroines, afterwards of the heroes, and converses in particular with Agamemnon and Achilles. Ajax keeps at a sullen distance, and disdains to answer him. He then beholds Tityus, Tantalus, Sisyphus, Hercules; till he is deterred from further curiosity by the apparition of horrid spectres, and the cries of the wicked in torments."], "How does Poseidon become aware of Odysseus?": [" Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief, it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried, touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homaeopathic dynameter.", " Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former.

He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon.", " \u201c\u2018But, when thy soul from her sweet mansion fled, Say, what distemper gave thee to the dead?

Phemius died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father\u2019s school with great success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his travels."], "What words characterize most of the women in The Odyssey?": [" With no less truth and feeling he proceeds:\u2014 \u201cIt seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible.

The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf\u2019s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning.", " Alike he thwarts the hospitable end, Who drives the free, or stays the hasty friend: True friendship\u2019s laws are by this rule express\u2019d, Welcome the coming, speed the parting guest.

Telemachus in the assembly of the lords of Ithaca complains of the injustice done him by the suitors, and insists upon their departure from his palace; appealing to the princes, and exciting the people to declare against them. The suitors endeavour to justify their stay, at least till he shall send the queen to the court of Icarius her father; which he refuses. There appears a prodigy of two eagles in the sky, which an augur expounds to the ruin of the suitors. Telemachus then demands a vessel to carry him to Pylos and Sparta, there to inquire of his father\u2019s fortunes.

But when the rosy morning warm\u2019d the east, My men I summon\u2019d, and these words address\u2019d: \u201c\u2018Followers and friends, attend what I propose: Ye sad companions of Ulysses\u2019 woes! We know not here what land before us lies, Or to what quarter now we turn our eyes, Or where the sun shall set, or where shall rise. Here let us think (if thinking be not vain) If any counsel, any hope remain. Alas! from yonder promontory\u2019s brow I view\u2019d the coast, a region flat and low; An isle encircled with the boundless flood; A length of thickets, and entangled wood. Some smoke I saw amid the forest rise, And all around it only seas and skies!\u2019 \u201cWith broken hearts my sad companions stood, Mindful of Cyclops and his human food, And horrid Laestrygons, the men of blood.", " No more my heart the dismal din sustains, And my cold blood hangs shivering in my veins; Lest Gorgon, rising from the infernal lakes, With horrors arm\u2019d, and curls of hissing snakes, Should fix me stiffen\u2019d at the monstrous sight, A stony image, in eternal night! Straight from the direful coast to purer air I speed my flight, and to my mates repair. My mates ascend the ship; they strike their oars; The mountains lessen, and retreat the shores; Swift o\u2019er the waves we fly; the freshening gales Sing through the shrouds, and stretch the swelling sails.\u201d BOOK XII. ARGUMENT. THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS. He relates how, after his return from the shades, he was sent by Circe on his voyage, by the coast of the Sirens, and by the strait of Scylla and Charybdis: the manner in which he escaped those dangers: how, being cast on the island Trinacria, his companions destroyed the oxen of the Sun: the vengeance that followed; how all perished by shipwreck except himself, who, swimming on the mast of the ship, arrived on the island of Calypso.", " Now did the rosy-finger\u2019d morn arise, And shed her sacred light along the skies. Down to the haven and the ships in haste They bore the treasures, and in safety placed. The king himself the vases ranged with care; Then bade his followers to the feast prepare. A victim ox beneath the sacred hand Of great Alcinous falls, and stains the sand. To Jove the Eternal (power above all powers! Who wings the winds, and darkens heaven with showers) The flames ascend: till evening they prolong The rites, more sacred made by heavenly song; For in the midst, with public honours graced, Thy lyre divine, Demodocus! was placed. All, but Ulysses, heard with fix\u2019d delight; He sate, and eyed the sun, and wish\u2019d the night; Slow seem\u2019d the sun to move, the hours to roll, His native home deep-imaged in his soul. As the tired ploughman, spent with stubborn toil, Whose oxen long have torn the furrow\u2019d soil, Sees with delight the sun\u2019s declining ray, When home with feeble knees he bends his way To late repast (the day\u2019s hard labour done); So to Ulysses welcome set the sun; Then instant to Alcinous and the rest (The Scherian states) he turn\u2019d, and thus address\u2019d: \u201cO thou, the first in merit and command!", " Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the \u2018Odyssea.\u2019 The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people\u2019s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, \u2018a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.\u2019 \u201cWhile employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon."], "What does Poseidon ask Zeus?": [" But Heaven, and all the Greeks, have heard my wrongs; To Heaven, and all the Greeks, redress belongs; Yet this I ask (nor be it ask\u2019d in vain), A bark to waft me o\u2019er the rolling main, The realms of Pyle and Sparta to explore, And seek my royal sire from shore to shore; If, or to fame his doubtful fate be known, Or to be learn\u2019d from oracles alone, If yet he lives, with patience I forbear, Till the fleet hours restore the circling year; But if already wandering in the train Of empty shades, I measure back the main, Plant the fair column o\u2019er the mighty dead, And yield his consort to the nuptial bed.\u201d He ceased; and while abash\u2019d the peers attend, Mentor arose, Ulysses\u2019 faithful friend: (When fierce in arms he sought the scenes of war, \u201cMy friend (he cried), my palace be thy care; Years roll\u2019d on years my godlike sire decay, Guard thou his age, and his behests obey.\u201d) Stern as he rose, he cast his eyes around, That flash\u2019d with rage; and as spoke, he frown\u2019d, \u201cO never, never more let king be just, Be mild in power, or faithful to his trust!", " Prepared I stand: he was but born to try The lot of man; to suffer, and to die.

Shall I the long, laborious scene review, And open all the wounds of Greece anew? What toils by sea! where dark in quest of prey Dauntless we roved; Achilles led the way; What toils by land! where mix\u2019d in fatal fight Such numbers fell, such heroes sunk to night; There Ajax great, Achilles there the brave, There wise Patroclus, fill an early grave: There, too, my son\u2014ah, once my best delight Once swift of foot, and terrible in fight; In whom stern courage with soft virtue join\u2019d A faultless body and a blameless mind; Antilochus\u2014What more can I relate?", " Here with his goats (not vow\u2019d to sacred fame, But pamper\u2019d luxury) Melanthias came: Two grooms attend him. With an envious look He eyed the stranger, and imperious spoke: \u201cThe good old proverb how this pair fulfil! One rogue is usher to another still. Heaven with a secret principle endued Mankind, to seek their own similitude. Where goes the swineherd with that ill-look\u2019d guest? That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast! Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn, From every great man\u2019s gate repulsed with scorn: To no brave prize aspired the worthless swain, \u2019Twas but for scraps he ask\u2019d, and ask\u2019d in vain. To beg, than work, he better understands, Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands. For any office could the slave be good, To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food. If any labour those big joints could learn, Some whey, to wash his bowels, he might earn. To cringe, to whine, his idle hands to spread, Is all, by which that graceless maw is fed.", " Minerva calls; the ready gales obey With rapid speed to whirl them o\u2019er the sea.

Meantime, the king, Eumaeus, and the rest, Sate in the cottage, at their rural feast: The banquet pass\u2019d, and satiate every man, To try his host, Ulysses thus began: \u201cYet one night more, my friends, indulge your guest; The last I purpose in your walls to rest: To-morrow for myself I must provide, And only ask your counsel, and a guide; Patient to roam the street, by hunger led, And bless the friendly hand that gives me bread. There in Ulysses\u2019 roof I may relate Ulysses\u2019 wanderings to his royal mate; Or, mingling with the suitors\u2019 haughty train, Not undeserving some support obtain."], "What does Athena do to help Odysseus in Ithaca?": [" Say, is the fault, through tame submission, thine? Or leagued against thee, do thy people join, Moved by some oracle, or voice divine? And yet who knows, but ripening lies in fate An hour of vengeance for the afflicted state; When great Ulysses shall suppress these harms, Ulysses singly, or all Greece in arms. But if Athena, war\u2019s triumphant maid, The happy son will as the father aid, (Whose fame and safety was her constant care In every danger and in every war: Never on man did heavenly favour shine With rays so strong, distinguish\u2019d and divine, As those with which Minerva mark\u2019d thy sire) So might she love thee, so thy soul inspire!

Ulysses takes his leave of Alcinous and Arete, and embarks in the evening.

The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the _dramatis person\u00e6_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style.

The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy. Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver\u2019d deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew: \u201cOne venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes!", " the truth I now relate! This sacred truth attest, each genial power, Who bless the board, and guard this friendly bower! Before thou quit the dome (nor long delay) Thy wish produced in act, with pleased survey, Thy wondering eyes shall view: his rightful reign By arms avow\u2019d Ulysses shall regain, And to the shades devote the suitor-train.\u201d \u201cO Jove supreme! (the raptured swain replies,) With deeds consummate soon the promised joys! These aged nerves, with new-born vigour strung, In that blest cause should emulate the young.\u201d Assents Eumaeus to the prayer address\u2019d; And equal ardours fire his loyal breast. Meantime the suitors urge the prince\u2019s fate, And deathful arts employ the dire debate: When in his airy tour, the bird of Jove Truss\u2019d with his sinewy pounce a trembling dove; Sinister to their hope! This omen eyed Amphinomus, who thus presaging cried: \u201cThe gods from force and fraud the prince defend; O peers!", " There, wrapped in silent shade, Pensive, the rules the goddess gave he weigh\u2019d; Stretch\u2019d on the downy fleece, no rest he knows, And in his raptured soul the vision glows. BOOK II. ARGUMENT. THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA. Telemachus in the assembly of the lords of Ithaca complains of the injustice done him by the suitors, and insists upon their departure from his palace; appealing to the princes, and exciting the people to declare against them. The suitors endeavour to justify their stay, at least till he shall send the queen to the court of Icarius her father; which he refuses. There appears a prodigy of two eagles in the sky, which an augur expounds to the ruin of the suitors. Telemachus then demands a vessel to carry him to Pylos and Sparta, there to inquire of his father\u2019s fortunes. Pallas, in the shape of Mentor (an ancient friend of Ulysses), helps him to a ship, assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage, and embarks with him that night; which concludes the second day from the opening of the poem.", " The queen awakes, deliver\u2019d of her woes; With florid joy her heart dilating glows: The vision, manifest of future fate, Makes her with hope her son\u2019s arrival wait. Meantime the suitors plough the watery plain, Telemachus in thought already slain! When sight of lessening Ithaca was lost Their sail directed for the Samian coast A small but verdant isle appear\u2019d in view, And Asteris the advancing pilot knew; An ample port the rocks projected form, To break the rolling waves and ruffling storm: That safe recess they gain with happy speed, And in close ambush wait the murderous deed. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. THE DEPARTURE OF ULYSSES FROM CALYPSO Pallas in a council of the gods complains of the detention of Ulysses in the Island of Calypso: whereupon Mercury is sent to command his removal. The seat of Calypso described. She consents with much difficulty; and Ulysses builds a vessel with his own hands, in which he embarks."], "Why does Telemachus want the gifts from Menelaus to be kept outside the palace?": [" There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen\u2019d from Boreas, high o\u2019erarch\u2019d they lay. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT. THE RETURN OF TELEMACHUS. The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus. Now had Minerva reach\u2019d those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses\u2019 heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display\u2019d, With Nestor\u2019s son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses!", " And now they ship their oars, and crown with wine The holy goblet to the powers divine: Imploring all the gods that reign above, But chief the blue-eyed progeny of Jove. Thus all the night they stem the liquid way, And end their voyage with the morning ray. BOOK III. ARGUMENT. THE INTERVIEW OF TELEMACHUS AND NESTOR. Telemachus, guided by Pallas in the shape of Mentor, arrives in the morning at Pylos, where Nestor and his sons are sacrificing on the sea- shore to Neptune. Telemachus declares the occasion of his coming: and Nestor relates what passed in their return from Troy, how their fleets were separated, and he never since heard of Ulysses. They discourse concerning the death of Agamemnon, the revenge of Orestes, and the injuries of the suitors. Nestor advises him to go to Sparta, and inquire further of Menelaus. The sacrifice ending with the night, Minerva vanishes from them in the form of an eagle: Telemachus is lodged in the palace.", " To Pherae now, Diocleus\u2019 stately seat (Of Alpheus\u2019 race), the weary youths retreat. His house affords the hospitable rite, And pleased they sleep (the blessing of the night). But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, With rosy lustre purpled o\u2019er the lawn, Again they mount, their journey to renew, And from the sounding portico they flew. Along the waving fields their way they hold The fields receding as their chariot roll\u2019d; Then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light, And o\u2019er the shaded landscape rush\u2019d the night. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. THE CONFERENCE WITH MENELAUS. Telemachus with Pisistratus arriving at Sparta, is hospitably received by Menelaus to whom he relates the cause of his coming, and learns from him many particulars of what befell the Greeks since the destruction of Troy. He dwells more at large upon the prophecies of Proteus to him in his return; from which he acquaints Telemachus that Ulysses is detained in the island of Calypso.", " O son of Neleus! awful Nestor, tell How he, the mighty Agamemnon, fell; By what strange fraud Aegysthus wrought, relate (By force he could not) such a hero\u2019s fate?

While us the works of bloody Mars employ\u2019d, The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoy\u2019d: He stretch\u2019d at ease in Argos\u2019 calm recess (Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless), With flattery\u2019s insinuating art Soothed the frail queen, and poison\u2019d all her heard."], "How do the other suitors greet the disguised Odysseus?": [" And call Jove\u2019s vengeance on their guilty deed.

This system\u2014which has often comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for those of the New Testament\u2014has been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized\u2014_Numa Pompilius_.", " The youth of Pylos, some on pointed wood Transfix\u2019d the fragments, some prepared the food: In friendly throngs they gather to embrace Their unknown guests, and at the banquet place, Pisistratus was first to grasp their hands, And spread soft hides upon the yellow sands; Along the shore the illustrious pair he led, Where Nestor sate with the youthful Thrasymed, To each a portion of the feast he bore, And held the golden goblet foaming o\u2019er; Then first approaching to the elder guest, The latent goddess in these words address\u2019d: \u201cWhoe\u2019er thou art, from fortune brings to keep These rites of Neptune, monarch of the deep, Thee first it fits, O stranger! to prepare The due libation and the solemn prayer; Then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine; Though much thy younger, and his years like mine, He too, I deem, implores the power divine; For all mankind alike require their grace, All born to want; a miserable race!\u201d He spake, and to her hand preferr\u2019d the bowl; A secret pleasure touch\u2019d Athena\u2019s soul, To see the preference due to sacred age Regarded ever by the just and sage."], "What does Theoclymenus interpret as a bad omen?": [" Upspringing from his couch, with active haste The fleece and carpet in the dome he placed (The hide, without, imbibed the morning air); And thus the gods invoked with ardent prayer: \u201cJove, and eternal thrones! with heaven to friend, If the long series of my woes shall end; Of human race now rising from repose, Let one a blissful omen here disclose; And, to confirm my faith, propitious Jove!

Observant of the prince\u2019s high behest, His menial train attend the stranger-guest; Whom Pallas with unpardoning fury fired, By lordly pride and keen reproach inspired.", " That rite complete, uprose the thoughtful man, And thus his meditated scheme began: \u201cIf what I ask your noble minds approve, Ye peers and rivals in the royal love!

Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures.

BOOK II. ARGUMENT. THE COUNCIL OF ITHACA. Telemachus in the assembly of the lords of Ithaca complains of the injustice done him by the suitors, and insists upon their departure from his palace; appealing to the princes, and exciting the people to declare against them. The suitors endeavour to justify their stay, at least till he shall send the queen to the court of Icarius her father; which he refuses. There appears a prodigy of two eagles in the sky, which an augur expounds to the ruin of the suitors. Telemachus then demands a vessel to carry him to Pylos and Sparta, there to inquire of his father\u2019s fortunes. Pallas, in the shape of Mentor (an ancient friend of Ulysses), helps him to a ship, assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage, and embarks with him that night; which concludes the second day from the opening of the poem.", " Now flames the rosy dawn, but Pallas shrouds The latent warriors in a veil of clouds. BOOK XXIV. ARGUMENT. The souls of the suitors are conducted by Mercury to the infernal shades. Ulysses in the country goes to the retirement of his father, Laertes; he finds him busied in his garden all alone; the manner of his discovery to him is beautifully described. They return together to his lodge, and the king is acknowledged by Dolius and the servants. The Ithacensians, led by Eupithes, the father of Antinous, rise against Ulysses, who gives them battle in which Eupithes is killed by Laertes: and the goddess Pallas makes a lasting peace between Ulysses and his subjects, which concludes the Odyssey. Cylenius now to Pluto\u2019s dreary reign Conveys the dead, a lamentable train! The golden wand, that causes sleep to fly, Or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye, That drives the ghosts to realms of night or day, Points out the long uncomfortable way.", " Fast by his father\u2019s side he takes his stand: The beamy javelin lightens in his hand. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT. THE DEATH OF THE SUITORS. Ulysses begins the slaughter of the suitors by the death of Antinous. He declares himself, and lets fly his arrows at the rest. Telemachus assists and brings arms for his father, himself, Eumaeus, and Philaetius. Melanthius does the same for the wooers. Minerva encourages Ulysses in the shape of Mentor. The suitors are all slain, only Medon and Phemius are spared. Melanthius and the unfaithful servants are executed. The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy. Then fierce the hero o\u2019er the threshold strode; Stripp\u2019d of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver\u2019d deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew: \u201cOne venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes!", " On her Ulysses then she fix\u2019d her soul; Down her fair cheek the tears abundant roll, Till gentle Pallas, piteous of her cries, In slumber closed her silver-streaming eyes. Now through the press the bow Eumaeus bore, And all was riot, noise, and wild uproar. \u201cHold! lawless rustic! whither wilt thou go? To whom, insensate, dost thou bear the bow? Exiled for this to some sequester\u2019d den, Far from the sweet society of men, To thy own dogs a prey thou shalt be made; If Heaven and Phoebus lend the suitors aid.\u201d Thus they. Aghast he laid the weapon down, But bold Telemachus thus urged him on: \u201cProceed, false slave, and slight their empty words: What! hopes the fool to please so many lords? Young as I am, thy prince\u2019s vengeful hand Stretch\u2019d forth in wrath shall drive thee from the land. Oh! could the vigour of this arm as well The oppressive suitors from my walls expel! Then what a shoal of lawless men should go To fill with tumult the dark courts below!\u201d The suitors with a scornful smile survey The youth, indulging in the genial day."], "What happens to Odysseus at the end of The Odyssey?": [" With no less truth and feeling he proceeds:\u2014 \u201cIt seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet.\u201d From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer an individual? or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?", " As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf\u2019s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning.", " Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably. \u201cIt was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most probably the former.

The grave and cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo, the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics. Longinus, in an oft-quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad; and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject: let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim. At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that \u201cHomer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment."]}
