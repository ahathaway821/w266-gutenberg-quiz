{"Which of the godsis the staunchest enemy of Aeneas and the Trojans?": [" Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames His tardy troops, and, calling by their names, Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats To lay in ashes, if they dare supply With arms or aid his vanquish\u2019d enemy: Thus menacing, he still pursues the course, With vigour, tho\u2019 diminish\u2019d of his force. Ten times already round the listed place One chief had fled, and t\u2019 other giv\u2019n the chase: No trivial prize is play\u2019d; for on the life Or death of Turnus now depends the strife. Within the space, an olive tree had stood, A sacred shade, a venerable wood, For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins\u2019 guardian god. Here hung the vests, and tablets were engrav\u2019d, Of sinking mariners from shipwreck sav\u2019d. With heedless hands the Trojans fell\u2019d the tree, To make the ground enclos\u2019d for combat free. Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance, Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance; Then stoop\u2019d, and tugg\u2019d with force immense, to free Th\u2019 incumber\u2019d spear from the tenacious tree; That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain, His flying weapon might from far attain. Confus\u2019d with fear, bereft of human aid, Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray\u2019d: \u201cO Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth, Where I thy foster son receiv\u2019d my birth, Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand Your plant has honour\u2019d, which your foes profan\u2019d, Propitious hear my pious pray\u2019r!\u201d He said, Nor with successless vows invok\u2019d their aid.", " Aeneas went Sad from the cave, and full of discontent, Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. Achates, the companion of his breast, Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress\u2019d. Walking, they talk\u2019d, and fruitlessly divin\u2019d What friend the priestess by those words design\u2019d. But soon they found an object to deplore: Misenus lay extended on the shore; Son of the God of Winds: none so renown\u2019d The warrior trumpet in the field to sound; With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms. He serv\u2019d great Hector, and was ever near, Not with his trumpet only, but his spear. But by Pelides\u2019 arms when Hector fell, He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well. Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more, He now provokes the sea gods from the shore; With envy Triton heard the martial sound, And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown\u2019d; Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand: The gazing crowd around the body stand. All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate, And hastens to perform the funeral state. In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; The basis broad below, and top advanc\u2019d in air. An ancient wood, fit for the work design\u2019d, (The shady covert of the salvage kind,) The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow\u2019ring pride Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.", " The weary Trojans ply their shatter\u2019d oars To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores. Within a long recess there lies a bay: An island shades it from the rolling sea, And forms a port secure for ships to ride; Broke by the jutting land, on either side, In double streams the briny waters glide. Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene Appears above, and groves for ever green: A grot is form\u2019d beneath, with mossy seats, To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats. Down thro\u2019 the crannies of the living walls The crystal streams descend in murm\u2019ring falls: No haulsers need to bind the vessels here, Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear. Sev\u2019n ships within this happy harbour meet, The thin remainders of the scatter\u2019d fleet. The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes, Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish\u2019d repose. First, good Achates, with repeated strokes Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes: Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither\u2019d leaves The dying sparkles in their fall receives: Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise, And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies. The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground: Some dry their corn, infected with the brine, Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine. Aeneas climbs the mountain\u2019s airy brow, And takes a prospect of the seas below, If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy, Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.", " Thither his warlike train the Trojan led, Refresh\u2019d his men, and wearied horses fed. Meantime the mother goddess, crown\u2019d with charms, Breaks thro\u2019 the clouds, and brings the fated arms. Within a winding vale she finds her son, On the cool river\u2019s banks, retir\u2019d alone. She shews her heav\u2019nly form without disguise, And gives herself to his desiring eyes. \u201cBehold,\u201d she said, \u201cperform\u2019d in ev\u2019ry part, My promise made, and Vulcan\u2019s labour\u2019d art. Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy, And haughty Turnus to the field defy.\u201d She said; and, having first her son embrac\u2019d, The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac\u2019d, Proud of the gift, he roll\u2019d his greedy sight Around the work, and gaz\u2019d with vast delight. He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires: His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold, One keen with temper\u2019d steel, one stiff with gold: Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright; So shines a cloud, when edg\u2019d with adverse light. He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try The plated cuishes on his manly thigh; But most admires the shield\u2019s mysterious mould, And Roman triumphs rising on the gold: For these, emboss\u2019d, the heav\u2019nly smith had wrought (Not in the rolls of future fate untaught) The wars in order, and the race divine Of warriors issuing from the Julian line. The cave of Mars was dress\u2019d with mossy greens: There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins."], "Who is the queenof Carthage, the city-state where Aeneas lands after the big stormin Book I?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AENEID *** Produced by Anonymous Volunteers and David Widger THE AENEID by Virgil Translated by John Dryden Contents BOOK I BOOK II BOOK III BOOK IV BOOK V BOOK VI BOOK VII BOOK VIII BOOK IX BOOK X BOOK XI BOOK XII BOOK I THE ARGUMENT. The Trojans, after a seven years\u2019 voyage, set sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Aeolus raises at the request of Juno. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune drives off the winds, and calms the sea. Aeneas, with his own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her son\u2019s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians. Aeneas, going out to discover the country, meets his mother in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by device of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some discourse with him, desires the history of his adventures since the siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following books. Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc\u2019d by fate, And haughty Juno\u2019s unrelenting hate, Expell\u2019d and exil\u2019d, left the Trojan shore. Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore, And in the doubtful war, before he won The Latian realm, and built the destin\u2019d town; His banish\u2019d gods restor\u2019d to rites divine, And settled sure succession in his line, From whence the race of Alban fathers come, And the long glories of majestic Rome.", " BOOK X THE ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\u201d Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large: \u201cO pow\u2019r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else protection can we fly?)", " Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are: A people rude in peace, and rough in war. The rising city, which from far you see, Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. Phoenician Dido rules the growing state, Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother\u2019s hate. Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, Possess\u2019d fair Dido\u2019s bed; and either heart At once was wounded with an equal dart. Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway\u2019d: One who condemn\u2019d divine and human laws. Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, With steel invades his brother\u2019s life by stealth; Before the sacred altar made him bleed, And long from her conceal\u2019d the cruel deed. Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin\u2019d, To soothe his sister, and delude her mind. At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares, And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. The cruel altars and his fate he tells, And the dire secret of his house reveals, Then warns the widow, with her household gods, To seek a refuge in remote abodes. Last, to support her in so long a way, He shows her where his hidden treasure lay. Admonish\u2019d thus, and seiz\u2019d with mortal fright, The queen provides companions of her flight: They meet, and all combine to leave the state, Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.", " I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.\u201d BOOK III THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet with which he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace. From thence he directs his course to Delos and asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation. By a mistake of the oracle\u2019s answer, he settles in Crete. His household gods give him the true sense of the oracle in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy. He is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies. This is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him upon the Carthaginian coast. When Heav\u2019n had overturn\u2019d the Trojan state And Priam\u2019s throne, by too severe a fate; When ruin\u2019d Troy became the Grecians\u2019 prey, And Ilium\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs in ashes lay; Warn\u2019d by celestial omens, we retreat, To seek in foreign lands a happier seat. Near old Antandros, and at Ida\u2019s foot, The timber of the sacred groves we cut, And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find What place the gods for our repose assign\u2019d. Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, When old Anchises summon\u2019d all to sea: The crew my father and the Fates obey. With sighs and tears I leave my native shore, And empty fields, where Ilium stood before."], "What was hiddeninside the wooden belly of the horse left outside the Trojan gates?": [" Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear, And still are worship\u2019d with religious fear) Before his temple stand: the dire abode, And the fear\u2019d issues of the furious god, Are fenc\u2019d with brazen bolts; without the gates, The wary guardian Janus doubly waits. Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars, The Roman consul their decree declares, And in his robes the sounding gates unbars. The youth in military shouts arise, And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies. These rites, of old by sov\u2019reign princes us\u2019d, Were the king\u2019s office; but the king refus\u2019d, Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar Of sacred peace, or loose th\u2019 imprison\u2019d war; But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms, Abhorr\u2019d the wicked ministry of arms. Then heav\u2019n\u2019s imperious queen shot down from high: At her approach the brazen hinges fly; The gates are forc\u2019d, and ev\u2019ry falling bar; And, like a tempest, issues out the war. The peaceful cities of th\u2019 Ausonian shore, Lull\u2019d in their ease, and undisturb\u2019d before, Are all on fire; and some, with studious care, Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare; Some their soft limbs in painful marches try, And war is all their wish, and arms the gen\u2019ral cry. Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart: With joy they view the waving ensigns fly, And hear the trumpet\u2019s clangour pierce the sky. Five cities forge their arms: th\u2019 Atinian pow\u2019rs, Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow\u2019rs, Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town: All these of old were places of renown.", " But since, opposing Heav\u2019n\u2019s decree, she goes To find her death among forbidden foes, Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight. Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight. This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath, This chosen arrow, to revenge her death: By whate\u2019er hand Camilla shall be slain, Or of the Trojan or Italian train, Let him not pass unpunish\u2019d from the plain. Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid To bear the breathless body of my maid: Unspoil\u2019d shall be her arms, and unprofan\u2019d Her holy limbs with any human hand, And in a marble tomb laid in her native land.\u201d She said. The faithful nymph descends from high With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky: Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly. By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse, Drawn up in squadrons, with united force, Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound, Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground. Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far; And the fields glitter with a waving war. Oppos\u2019d to these, come on with furious force Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse; These in the body plac\u2019d, on either hand Sustain\u2019d and clos\u2019d by fair Camilla\u2019s band. Advancing in a line, they couch their spears; And less and less the middle space appears. Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen The neighing coursers, and the shouting men. In distance of their darts they stop their course; Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.", " Let them not fear the treasons of the night, The robb\u2019d Palladium, the pretended flight: Our onset shall be made in open light. No wooden engine shall their town betray; Fires they shall have around, but fires by day. No Grecian babes before their camp appear, Whom Hector\u2019s arms detain\u2019d to the tenth tardy year. Now, since the sun is rolling to the west, Give we the silent night to needful rest: Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare; The morn shall end the small remains of war.\u201d The post of honour to Messapus falls, To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls, To pitch the fires at distances around, And close the Trojans in their scanty ground. Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand, And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command; All clad in shining arms the works invest, Each with a radiant helm and waving crest. Stretch\u2019d at their length, they press the grassy ground; They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,) With lights and cheerful fires renew the day, And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play. The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld, And with arm\u2019d legions all the rampires fill\u2019d. Seiz\u2019d with affright, their gates they first explore; Join works to works with bridges, tow\u2019r to tow\u2019r: Thus all things needful for defence abound. Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round, Commission\u2019d by their absent prince to share The common danger, and divide the care.", " The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide, With noise say nothing, and in parts divide. Laocoon, follow\u2019d by a num\u2019rous crowd, Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud: \u2018O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns? What more than madness has possess\u2019d your brains? Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone? And are Ulysses\u2019 arts no better known? This hollow fabric either must inclose, Within its blind recess, our secret foes; Or \u2019tis an engine rais\u2019d above the town, T\u2019 o\u2019erlook the walls, and then to batter down. Somewhat is sure design\u2019d, by fraud or force: Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.\u2019 Thus having said, against the steed he threw His forceful spear, which, hissing as it flew, Pierc\u2019d thro\u2019 the yielding planks of jointed wood, And trembling in the hollow belly stood. The sides, transpierc\u2019d, return a rattling sound, And groans of Greeks inclos\u2019d come issuing thro\u2019 the wound And, had not Heav\u2019n the fall of Troy design\u2019d, Or had not men been fated to be blind, Enough was said and done t\u2019inspire a better mind. Then had our lances pierc\u2019d the treach\u2019rous wood, And Ilian tow\u2019rs and Priam\u2019s empire stood. Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring A captive Greek, in bands, before the king; Taken to take; who made himself their prey, T\u2019 impose on their belief, and Troy betray; Fix\u2019d on his aim, and obstinately bent To die undaunted, or to circumvent. About the captive, tides of Trojans flow; All press to see, and some insult the foe."], "Who does not diein the sack of Troy?": [" The greatest, sure, and best you can receive, The gods and your own conscious worth will give. The rest our grateful gen\u2019ral will bestow, And young Ascanius till his manhood owe.\u201d \u201cAnd I, whose welfare in my father lies,\u201d Ascanius adds, \u201cby the great deities, By my dear country, by my household gods, By hoary Vesta\u2019s rites and dark abodes, Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands; That and my faith I plight into your hands,) Make me but happy in his safe return, Whose wanted presence I can only mourn; Your common gift shall two large goblets be Of silver, wrought with curious imagery, And high emboss\u2019d, which, when old Priam reign\u2019d, My conqu\u2019ring sire at sack\u2019d Arisba gain\u2019d; And more, two tripods cast in antique mould, With two great talents of the finest gold; Beside a costly bowl, ingrav\u2019d with art, Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart. But, if in conquer\u2019d Italy we reign, When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain\u2014 Thou saw\u2019st the courser by proud Turnus press\u2019d: That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest, And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share: Twelve lab\u2019ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair All clad in rich attire, and train\u2019d with care; And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains, And a large portion of the king\u2019s domains.

He comes; behold the god!\u201d Thus while she said, (And shiv\u2019ring at the sacred entry stay\u2019d,) Her colour chang\u2019d; her face was not the same, And hollow groans from her deep spirit came. Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess\u2019d Her trembling limbs, and heav\u2019d her lab\u2019ring breast. Greater than humankind she seem\u2019d to look, And with an accent more than mortal spoke. Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll; When all the god came rushing on her soul. Swiftly she turn\u2019d, and, foaming as she spoke: \u201cWhy this delay?\u201d she cried; \u201cthe pow\u2019rs invoke! Thy pray\u2019rs alone can open this abode; Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god.\u201d She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear, O\u2019erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear.

Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place, With fury has pursued her wand\u2019ring race. Here cease, ye pow\u2019rs, and let your vengeance end: Troy is no more, and can no more offend.", " His hair and beard stood stiffen\u2019d with his gore; And all the wounds he for his country bore Now stream\u2019d afresh, and with new purple ran. I wept to see the visionary man, And, while my trance continued, thus began: \u2018O light of Trojans, and support of Troy, Thy father\u2019s champion, and thy country\u2019s joy! O, long expected by thy friends! from whence Art thou so late return\u2019d for our defence? Do we behold thee, wearied as we are With length of labours, and with toils of war? After so many fun\u2019rals of thy own Art thou restor\u2019d to thy declining town? But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace Deforms the manly features of thy face?\u2019 \u201cTo this the spectre no reply did frame, But answer\u2019d to the cause for which he came, And, groaning from the bottom of his breast, This warning in these mournful words express\u2019d: \u2018O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight, The flames and horrors of this fatal night. The foes already have possess\u2019d the wall; Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall. Enough is paid to Priam\u2019s royal name, More than enough to duty and to fame. If by a mortal hand my father\u2019s throne Could be defended, \u2019twas by mine alone. Now Troy to thee commends her future state, And gives her gods companions of thy fate: From their assistance walls expect, Which, wand\u2019ring long, at last thou shalt erect.\u2019 He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes, The venerable statues of the gods, With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir, The wreaths and relics of th\u2019 immortal fire.", " Thus Priam fell, and shar\u2019d one common fate With Troy in ashes, and his ruin\u2019d state: He, who the scepter of all Asia sway\u2019d, Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey\u2019d. On the bleak shore now lies th\u2019 abandon\u2019d king, A headless carcass, and a nameless thing. \u201cThen, not before, I felt my curdled blood Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood: My father\u2019s image fill\u2019d my pious mind, Lest equal years might equal fortune find. Again I thought on my forsaken wife, And trembled for my son\u2019s abandon\u2019d life. I look\u2019d about, but found myself alone, Deserted at my need! My friends were gone. Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress\u2019d, Leap\u2019d headlong from the heights; the flames consum\u2019d the rest. Thus, wand\u2019ring in my way, without a guide, The graceless Helen in the porch I spied Of Vesta\u2019s temple; there she lurk\u2019d alone; Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: But, by the flames that cast their blaze around, That common bane of Greece and Troy I found. For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword; More dreads the vengeance of her injur\u2019d lord; Ev\u2019n by those gods who refug\u2019d her abhorr\u2019d. Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard, Resolv\u2019d to give her guilt the due reward: \u2018Shall she triumphant sail before the wind, And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind? Shall she her kingdom and her friends review, In state attended with a captive crew, While unreveng\u2019d the good old Priam falls, And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?"], "What prophesydoes the Harpy issue?": [" Now all things to their utmost issue tend, Push\u2019d by the Fates to their appointed end.

Else should you not behold me here, alone, Involv\u2019d in empty clouds, my friends bemoan, But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight Engag\u2019d against my foes in mortal fight. \u2019Tis true, Juturna mingled in the strife By my command, to save her brother\u2019s life, At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake, (The most religious oath the gods can take,) With this restriction, not to bend the bow, Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw. And now, resign\u2019d to your superior might, And tir\u2019d with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.

There end your toils; and there your fates provide A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride: There fortune shall the Trojan line restore, And you for lost Creusa weep no more. Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame, Th\u2019 imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame; Or, stooping to the victor\u2019s lust, disgrace My goddess mother, or my royal race. And now, farewell! The parent of the gods Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes: I trust our common issue to your care.\u2019 She said, and gliding pass\u2019d unseen in air. I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue; And thrice about her neck my arms I flung, And, thrice deceiv\u2019d, on vain embraces hung. Light as an empty dream at break of day, Or as a blast of wind, she rush\u2019d away. \u201cThus having pass\u2019d the night in fruitless pain, I to my longing friends return again, Amaz\u2019d th\u2019 augmented number to behold, Of men and matrons mix\u2019d, of young and old; A wretched exil\u2019d crew together brought, With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught, Resolv\u2019d, and willing, under my command, To run all hazards both of sea and land. The Morn began, from Ida, to display Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day: Before the gates the Grecians took their post, And all pretence of late relief was lost.", " My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne, And should, but he\u2019s a Sabine mother\u2019s son, And half a native; but, in you, combine A manly vigour, and a foreign line. Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way, Pursue the ready path to sov\u2019reign sway. The staff of my declining days, my son, Shall make your good or ill success his own; In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare, And serve the hard apprenticeship of war; Your matchless courage and your conduct view, And early shall begin t\u2019 admire and copy you. Besides, two hundred horse he shall command; Tho\u2019 few, a warlike and well-chosen band. These in my name are listed; and my son As many more has added in his own.\u201d Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest, With downcast eyes, their silent grief express\u2019d; Who, short of succours, and in deep despair, Shook at the dismal prospect of the war. But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud, To cheer her issue, thunder\u2019d thrice aloud; Thrice forky lightning flash\u2019d along the sky, And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear; And, in a heav\u2019n serene, refulgent arms appear: Redd\u2019ning the skies, and glitt\u2019ring all around, The temper\u2019d metals clash, and yield a silver sound.

Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew Should share such triumphs, and detain from you The post of honour, your undoubted due. Rather alone your matchless force employ, To merit what alone you must enjoy.\u201d These words, so full of malice mix\u2019d with art, Inflam\u2019d with rage the youthful hero\u2019s heart. Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast, He heav\u2019d for wind, and thus his wrath express\u2019d: \u201cYou, Drances, never want a stream of words, Then, when the public need requires our swords. First in the council hall to steer the state, And ever foremost in a tongue-debate, While our strong walls secure us from the foe, Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow: But let the potent orator declaim, And with the brand of coward blot my name; Free leave is giv\u2019n him, when his fatal hand Has cover\u2019d with more corps the sanguine strand, And high as mine his tow\u2019ring trophies stand. If any doubt remains, who dares the most, Let us decide it at the Trojan\u2019s cost, And issue both abreast, where honour calls\u2014 (Foes are not far to seek without the walls) Unless his noisy tongue can only fight, And feet were giv\u2019n him but to speed his flight.

While rolling rivers into seas shall run, And round the space of heav\u2019n the radiant sun; While trees the mountain tops with shades supply, Your honour, name, and praise shall never die.

Had Heav\u2019n decreed that I should life enjoy, Heav\u2019n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. \u2019Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, And give this useless corpse a long adieu. These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; At least the pitying foes will aid my death, To take my spoils, and leave my body bare: As for my sepulcher, let Heav\u2019n take care. \u2019Tis long since I, for my celestial wife Loath\u2019d by the gods, have dragg\u2019d a ling\u2019ring life; Since ev\u2019ry hour and moment I expire, Blasted from heav\u2019n by Jove\u2019s avenging fire.\u2019 This oft repeated, he stood fix\u2019d to die: Myself, my wife, my son, my family, Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry. \u2018What, will he still persist, on death resolve, And in his ruin all his house involve!\u2019 He still persists his reasons to maintain; Our pray\u2019rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. \u201cUrg\u2019d by despair, again I go to try The fate of arms, resolv\u2019d in fight to die: \u2018What hope remains, but what my death must give?", " Soon as approach\u2019d, upon his knees he falls, And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls: \u2018Now, by the pow\u2019rs above, and what we share From Nature\u2019s common gift, this vital air, O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more; But bear me far from this unhappy shore. \u2019Tis true, I am a Greek, and farther own, Among your foes besieg\u2019d th\u2019 imperial town. For such demerits if my death be due, No more for this abandon\u2019d life I sue; This only favour let my tears obtain, To throw me headlong in the rapid main: Since nothing more than death my crime demands, I die content, to die by human hands.\u2019 He said, and on his knees my knees embrac\u2019d: I bade him boldly tell his fortune past, His present state, his lineage, and his name, Th\u2019 occasion of his fears, and whence he came.

Aeneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet with which he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace. From thence he directs his course to Delos and asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation. By a mistake of the oracle\u2019s answer, he settles in Crete. His household gods give him the true sense of the oracle in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy. He is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies. This is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him upon the Carthaginian coast. When Heav\u2019n had overturn\u2019d the Trojan state And Priam\u2019s throne, by too severe a fate; When ruin\u2019d Troy became the Grecians\u2019 prey, And Ilium\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs in ashes lay; Warn\u2019d by celestial omens, we retreat, To seek in foreign lands a happier seat. Near old Antandros, and at Ida\u2019s foot, The timber of the sacred groves we cut, And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find What place the gods for our repose assign\u2019d. Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, When old Anchises summon\u2019d all to sea: The crew my father and the Fates obey. With sighs and tears I leave my native shore, And empty fields, where Ilium stood before."], "Who breaks offthe love affair between Aeneas and Dido?": [" Two gods a silly woman have undone!

The doubt is all from Jove and destiny; Lest he forbid, with absolute command, To mix the people in one common land.

Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn\u2019d to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII THE ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call\u2019d from thee, The nurse of great Aeneas\u2019 infancy. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia\u2019s plains; Thy name (\u2019tis all a ghost can have) remains. Now, when the prince her fun\u2019ral rites had paid, He plow\u2019d the Tyrrhene seas with sails display\u2019d. From land a gentle breeze arose by night, Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, And the sea trembled with her silver light. Now near the shelves of Circe\u2019s shores they run, (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) A dang\u2019rous coast: the goddess wastes her days In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, And cedar brands supply her father\u2019s light.", " Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound, He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies, And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies. Their tasks perform\u2019d, the serpents quit their prey, And to the tow\u2019r of Pallas make their way: Couch\u2019d at her feet, they lie protected there By her large buckler and protended spear. Amazement seizes all; the gen\u2019ral cry Proclaims Laocoon justly doom\u2019d to die, Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood, And dared to violate the sacred wood. All vote t\u2019 admit the steed, that vows be paid And incense offer\u2019d to th\u2019 offended maid. A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare; Some hoisting levers, some the wheels prepare And fasten to the horse\u2019s feet; the rest With cables haul along th\u2019 unwieldly beast. Each on his fellow for assistance calls; At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls, Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown\u2019d, And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around.

While the ceremonies are performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan woman to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them: which burned four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous shower extinguished it.", " Yet from the flames our burning vessels free, Or let thy fury fall alone on me!

Aeneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage. He applies himself to celebrate the memory of his father with divine honours, and accordingly institues funeral games, and appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the ceremonies are performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan woman to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them: which burned four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous shower extinguished it.", " He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod. And now at length the number\u2019d hours were come, Prefix\u2019d by fate\u2019s irrevocable doom, When the great Mother of the Gods was free To save her ships, and finish Jove\u2019s decree. First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung A light that sign\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, and shot along; Then from a cloud, fring\u2019d round with golden fires, Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs; And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds, Both hosts, in arms oppos\u2019d, with equal horror wounds: \u201cO Trojan race, your needless aid forbear, And know, my ships are my peculiar care. With greater ease the bold Rutulian may, With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea, Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge, Loos\u2019d from your crooked anchors, launch at large, Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand, And swim the seas, at Cybele\u2019s command.\u201d No sooner had the goddess ceas\u2019d to speak, When, lo! th\u2019 obedient ships their haulsers break; And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again: As many beauteous maids the billows sweep, As rode before tall vessels on the deep. The foes, surpris\u2019d with wonder, stood aghast; Messapus curb\u2019d his fiery courser\u2019s haste; Old Tiber roar\u2019d, and, raising up his head, Call\u2019d back his waters to their oozy bed. Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, And with these words his trembling troops bespoke: \u201cThese monsters for the Trojans\u2019 fate are meant, And are by Jove for black presages sent.", " I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.\u201d BOOK III THE ARGUMENT.

Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister\u2019s entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes.

Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, That, were I not resolv\u2019d against the yoke Of hapless marriage, never to be curst With second love, so fatal was my first, To this one error I might yield again; For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain, This only man is able to subvert The fix\u2019d foundations of my stubborn heart.", " Of various things discoursing as he pass\u2019d, Anchises hither bends his steps at last.

Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call\u2019d from thee, The nurse of great Aeneas\u2019 infancy. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia\u2019s plains; Thy name (\u2019tis all a ghost can have) remains. Now, when the prince her fun\u2019ral rites had paid, He plow\u2019d the Tyrrhene seas with sails display\u2019d. From land a gentle breeze arose by night, Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, And the sea trembled with her silver light. Now near the shelves of Circe\u2019s shores they run, (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) A dang\u2019rous coast: the goddess wastes her days In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, And cedar brands supply her father\u2019s light."], "What symbolizesthe beginning of battle for the Latins?": [" A cloud of blinding dust is rais\u2019d around, Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground. Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far Beheld the progress of the moving war: With him the Latins view\u2019d the cover\u2019d plains, And the chill blood ran backward in their veins. Juturna saw th\u2019 advancing troops appear, And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear. Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train, Clos\u2019d in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore From the mid ocean, drives the waves before; The painful hind with heavy heart foresees The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees; With like impetuous rage the prince appears Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. And now both armies shock in open field; Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill\u2019d. Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain (All fam\u2019d in arms, and of the Latian train) By Gyas\u2019, Mnestheus\u2019, and Achates\u2019 hand. The fatal augur falls, by whose command The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued With Trojan blood, th\u2019 unhappy fight renew\u2019d. Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky, And o\u2019er the field the frighted Latins fly. The prince disdains the dastards to pursue, Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few; Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain, He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain. Juturna heard, and, seiz\u2019d with mortal fear, Forc\u2019d from the beam her brother\u2019s charioteer; Assumes his shape, his armour, and his mien, And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen.", " The steel thro\u2019 both his temples forc\u2019d the way: Extended on the ground, Numanus lay. \u201cGo now, vain boaster, and true valour scorn! The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.\u201d Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake The heav\u2019ns with shouting, and new vigour take. Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud: \u201cAdvance, illustrious youth, increase in fame, And wide from east to west extend thy name; Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe To thee a race of demigods below. This is the way to heav\u2019n: the pow\u2019rs divine From this beginning date the Julian line. To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, The conquer\u2019d war is due, and the vast world is theirs. Troy is too narrow for thy name.\u201d He said, And plunging downward shot his radiant head; Dispell\u2019d the breathing air, that broke his flight: Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. Old Butes\u2019 form he took, Anchises\u2019 squire, Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: \u201cSuffice it thee, thy father\u2019s worthy son, The warlike prize thou hast already won. The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. Now tempt the war no more.\u201d He said, and flew Obscure in air, and vanish\u2019d from their view.", " He first in open field defied the prince: But armour scal\u2019d with gold was no defence Against the fated sword, which open\u2019d wide His plated shield, and pierc\u2019d his naked side. Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born, Was from his wretched mother ripp\u2019d and torn; Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee; For his beginning life from biting steel was free. Not far from him was Gyas laid along, Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail\u2019d, Nor valour nor Herculean arms avail\u2019d, Nor their fam\u2019d father, wont in war to go With great Alcides, while he toil\u2019d below. The noisy Pharos next receiv\u2019d his death: Aeneas writh\u2019d his dart, and stopp\u2019d his bawling breath. Then wretched Cydon had receiv\u2019d his doom, Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, And sought with lust obscene polluted joys: The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys, Had not his sev\u2019n bold brethren stopp\u2019d the course Of the fierce champions, with united force. Sev\u2019n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: The rest had reach\u2019d him; but his mother\u2019s care Prevented those, and turn\u2019d aside in air. The prince then call\u2019d Achates, to supply The spears that knew the way to victory\u2014 \u201cThose fatal weapons, which, inur\u2019d to blood, In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain Against our foes, on this contended plain.\u201d He said; then seiz\u2019d a mighty spear, and threw; Which, wing\u2019d with fate, thro\u2019 Maeon\u2019s buckler flew, Pierc\u2019d all the brazen plates, and reach\u2019d his heart: He stagger\u2019d with intolerable smart.", " Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land."], "How does Evanderknow Aeneas\u2019s father, Anchises?": [" I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.\u201d BOOK III THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet with which he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace. From thence he directs his course to Delos and asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation. By a mistake of the oracle\u2019s answer, he settles in Crete. His household gods give him the true sense of the oracle in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy. He is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies. This is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him upon the Carthaginian coast. When Heav\u2019n had overturn\u2019d the Trojan state And Priam\u2019s throne, by too severe a fate; When ruin\u2019d Troy became the Grecians\u2019 prey, And Ilium\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs in ashes lay; Warn\u2019d by celestial omens, we retreat, To seek in foreign lands a happier seat. Near old Antandros, and at Ida\u2019s foot, The timber of the sacred groves we cut, And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find What place the gods for our repose assign\u2019d. Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, When old Anchises summon\u2019d all to sea: The crew my father and the Fates obey. With sighs and tears I leave my native shore, And empty fields, where Ilium stood before.", " The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin\u2019d; If acts of mercy touch their heav\u2019nly mind, And, more than all the gods, your gen\u2019rous heart. Conscious of worth, requite its own desert! In you this age is happy, and this earth, And parents more than mortal gave you birth. While rolling rivers into seas shall run, And round the space of heav\u2019n the radiant sun; While trees the mountain tops with shades supply, Your honour, name, and praise shall never die. Whate\u2019er abode my fortune has assign\u2019d, Your image shall be present in my mind.\u201d Thus having said, he turn\u2019d with pious haste, And joyful his expecting friends embrac\u2019d: With his right hand Ilioneus was grac\u2019d, Serestus with his left; then to his breast Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press\u2019d; And so by turns descended to the rest. The Tyrian queen stood fix\u2019d upon his face, Pleas\u2019d with his motions, ravish\u2019d with his grace; Admir\u2019d his fortunes, more admir\u2019d the man; Then recollected stood, and thus began: \u201cWhat fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow\u2019rs Have cast you shipwreck\u2019d on our barren shores? Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame, Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore To fam\u2019d Anchises on th\u2019 Idaean shore? It calls into my mind, tho\u2019 then a child, When Teucer came, from Salamis exil\u2019d, And sought my father\u2019s aid, to be restor\u2019d: My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare, And, conqu\u2019ring, finish\u2019d the successful war.", " Of various things discoursing as he pass\u2019d, Anchises hither bends his steps at last. Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn\u2019d to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII THE ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related.

Receive our offer\u2019d faith, and give us thine; Ours is a gen\u2019rous and experienc\u2019d line: We want not hearts nor bodies for the war; In council cautious, and in fields we dare.\u201d He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes Evander view\u2019d the man with vast surprise, Pleas\u2019d with his action, ravish\u2019d with his face: Then answer\u2019d briefly, with a royal grace: \u201cO valiant leader of the Trojan line, In whom the features of thy father shine, How I recall Anchises! how I see His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee! Long tho\u2019 it be, \u2019tis fresh within my mind, When Priam to his sister\u2019s court design\u2019d A welcome visit, with a friendly stay, And thro\u2019 th\u2019 Arcadian kingdom took his way. Then, past a boy, the callow down began To shade my chin, and call me first a man. I saw the shining train with vast delight, And Priam\u2019s goodly person pleas\u2019d my sight: But great Anchises, far above the rest, With awful wonder fir\u2019d my youthful breast. I long\u2019d to join in friendship\u2019s holy bands Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands. I first accosted him: I sued, I sought, And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought. He gave me, when at length constrain\u2019d to go, A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow, A vest embroider\u2019d, glorious to behold, And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold, Which my son\u2019s coursers in obedience hold."], "Who makes thestrong and beautiful new armor Aeneas wears into battle?": [" His servants bore him off, and softly laid His languish\u2019d limbs upon his homely bed. The horsemen march; the gates are open\u2019d wide; Aeneas at their head, Achates by his side. Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along; Last follows in the rear th\u2019 Arcadian throng. Young Pallas shone conspicuous o\u2019er the rest; Gilded his arms, embroider\u2019d was his vest. So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head The star by whom the lights of heav\u2019n are led; Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews, Dispels the darkness, and the day renews. The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd, And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud, Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war. The troops, drawn up in beautiful array, O\u2019er heathy plains pursue the ready way. Repeated peals of shouts are heard around; The neighing coursers answer to the sound, And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground. A greenwood shade, for long religion known, Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town, Incompass\u2019d round with gloomy hills above, Which add a holy horror to the grove. The first inhabitants of Grecian blood, That sacred forest to Silvanus vow\u2019d, The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay Their due devotions on his annual day. Not far from hence, along the river\u2019s side, In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide, By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground, Aeneas cast his wond\u2019ring eyes around, And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight, Stretch\u2019d on the spacious plain from left to right.", " Both to the city bend.

For strong Alcides, after he had slain The triple Geryon, drove from conquer\u2019d Spain His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led, On Tuscan Tiber\u2019s flow\u2019ry banks they fed. Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove The priestess Rhea found, and forc\u2019d to love. For arms, his men long piles and jav\u2019lins bore; And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore. Like Hercules himself his son appears, In salvage pomp; a lion\u2019s hide he wears; About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin; The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin. Thus, like the god his father, homely dress\u2019d, He strides into the hall, a horrid guest. Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came, (Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,) Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear: Arm\u2019d Argive horse they led, and in the front appear. Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain\u2019s height With rapid course descending to the fight; They rush along; the rattling woods give way; The branches bend before their sweepy sway. Nor was Praeneste\u2019s founder wanting there, Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber: Found in the fire, and foster\u2019d in the plains, A shepherd and a king at once he reigns, And leads to Turnus\u2019 aid his country swains.", " Jupiter despatches Mercury to Aeneas, to warn him from Carthage. Aeneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister\u2019s entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But anxious cares already seiz\u2019d the queen: She fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero\u2019s valour, acts, and birth inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, Improve the passion, and increase the smart. Now, when the purple morn had chas\u2019d away The dewy shadows, and restor\u2019d the day, Her sister first with early care she sought, And thus in mournful accents eas\u2019d her thought: \u201cMy dearest Anna, what new dreams affright My lab\u2019ring soul! what visions of the night Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast With strange ideas of our Trojan guest! His worth, his actions, and majestic air, A man descended from the gods declare. Fear ever argues a degenerate kind; His birth is well asserted by his mind. Then, what he suffer\u2019d, when by Fate betray\u2019d! What brave attempts for falling Troy he made! Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, That, were I not resolv\u2019d against the yoke Of hapless marriage, never to be curst With second love, so fatal was my first, To this one error I might yield again; For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain, This only man is able to subvert The fix\u2019d foundations of my stubborn heart."], "Why do the Trojanships turn into sea nymphs when Turnus tries to burn them?": [" And here the tam\u2019d Euphrates humbly glides, And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; The Danes\u2019 unconquer\u2019d offspring march behind, And Morini, the last of humankind. These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, By Vulcan labour\u2019d, and by Venus brought, With joy and wonder fill the hero\u2019s thought. Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. BOOK IX THE ARGUMENT. Turnus takes advantage of Aeneas\u2019s absence, fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea nymphs,) and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduced to the last extremities, send Ninus and Euryalus to recall Aeneas; which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and the conclusion of their adventure. While these affairs in distant places pass\u2019d, The various Iris Juno sends with haste, To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, The secret shade of his great grandsire sought. Retir\u2019d alone she found the daring man, And op\u2019d her rosy lips, and thus began: \u201cWhat none of all the gods could grant thy vows, That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. Aeneas, gone to seek th\u2019 Arcadian prince, Has left the Trojan camp without defence; And, short of succours there, employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs; Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.\u201d This said, on equal wings she pois\u2019d her weight, And form\u2019d a radiant rainbow in her flight.", " He summon\u2019d Eurus and the western blast, And first an angry glance on both he cast; Then thus rebuk\u2019d: \u201cAudacious winds! from whence This bold attempt, this rebel insolence? Is it for you to ravage seas and land, Unauthoriz\u2019d by my supreme command? To raise such mountains on the troubled main? Whom I\u2014but first \u2019tis fit the billows to restrain; And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign. Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear, The realms of ocean and the fields of air Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea. His pow\u2019r to hollow caverns is confin\u2019d: There let him reign, the jailer of the wind, With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call, And boast and bluster in his empty hall.\u201d He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth\u2019d the sea, Dispell\u2019d the darkness, and restor\u2019d the day. Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main, Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands: The god himself with ready trident stands, And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands; Then heaves them off the shoals. Where\u2019er he guides His finny coursers and in triumph rides, The waves unruffle and the sea subsides. As, when in tumults rise th\u2019 ignoble crowd, Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud; And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly, And all the rustic arms that fury can supply: If then some grave and pious man appear, They hush their noise, and lend a list\u2019ning ear; He soothes with sober words their angry mood, And quenches their innate desire of blood: So, when the Father of the Flood appears, And o\u2019er the seas his sov\u2019reign trident rears, Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains, High on his chariot, and, with loosen\u2019d reins, Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains.", " Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare Her alter\u2019d mind and alienated care. When first her fatal image touch\u2019d the ground, She sternly cast her glaring eyes around, That sparkled as they roll\u2019d, and seem\u2019d to threat: Her heav\u2019nly limbs distill\u2019d a briny sweat. Thrice from the ground she leap\u2019d, was seen to wield Her brandish\u2019d lance, and shake her horrid shield. Then Calchas bade our host for flight And hope no conquest from the tedious war, Till first they sail\u2019d for Greece; with pray\u2019rs besought Her injur\u2019d pow\u2019r, and better omens brought. And now their navy plows the wat\u2019ry main, Yet soon expect it on your shores again, With Pallas pleas\u2019d; as Calchas did ordain. But first, to reconcile the blue-ey\u2019d maid For her stol\u2019n statue and her tow\u2019r betray\u2019d, Warn\u2019d by the seer, to her offended name We rais\u2019d and dedicate this wondrous frame, So lofty, lest thro\u2019 your forbidden gates It pass, and intercept our better fates: For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost; And Troy may then a new Palladium boast; For so religion and the gods ordain, That, if you violate with hands profane Minerva\u2019s gift, your town in flames shall burn, (Which omen, O ye gods, on Grecia turn!) But if it climb, with your assisting hands, The Trojan walls, and in the city stands; Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn, And the reverse of fate on us return.\u2019 \u201cWith such deceits he gain\u2019d their easy hearts, Too prone to credit his perfidious arts.", " A hairy man above the waist he shows; A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows; And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides, And froth and foam augment the murm\u2019ring tides. Full thirty ships transport the chosen train For Troy\u2019s relief, and scour the briny main. Now was the world forsaken by the sun, And Phoebe half her nightly race had run. The careful chief, who never clos\u2019d his eyes, Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies. A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood, Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida\u2019s wood; But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep, As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep. They know him from afar; and in a ring Enclose the ship that bore the Trojan king. Cymodoce, whose voice excell\u2019d the rest, Above the waves advanc\u2019d her snowy breast; Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides The curling ocean, and corrects the tides. She spoke for all the choir, and thus began With pleasing words to warn th\u2019 unknowing man: \u201cSleeps our lov\u2019d lord? O goddess-born, awake! Spread ev\u2019ry sail, pursue your wat\u2019ry track, And haste your course. Your navy once were we, From Ida\u2019s height descending to the sea; Till Turnus, as at anchor fix\u2019d we stood, Presum\u2019d to violate our holy wood. Then, loos\u2019d from shore, we fled his fires profane (Unwillingly we broke our master\u2019s chain), And since have sought you thro\u2019 the Tuscan main. The mighty Mother chang\u2019d our forms to these, And gave us life immortal in the seas."], "Who begs to beexecuted in place of his friend Euryalus?": [" The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall, By turns relieve each other on the wall. Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance, To watch the gate was warlike Nisus\u2019 chance. His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; His mother was a huntress of the wood, And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, But better skill\u2019d unerring shafts to send. Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend: Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast. Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. One was their care, and their delight was one: One common hazard in the war they shar\u2019d, And now were both by choice upon the guard. Then Nisus thus: \u201cOr do the gods inspire This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? A gen\u2019rous ardour boils within my breast, Eager of action, enemy to rest: This urges me to fight, and fires my mind To leave a memorable name behind. Thou see\u2019st the foe secure; how faintly shine Their scatter\u2019d fires! the most, in sleep supine Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; All hush\u2019d around. Now hear what I revolve\u2014 A thought unripe\u2014and scarcely yet resolve. Our absent prince both camp and council mourn; By message both would hasten his return: If they confer what I demand on thee, (For fame is recompense enough for me,) Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied A way that safely will my passage guide.\u201d Euryalus stood list\u2019ning while he spoke, With love of praise and noble envy struck; Then to his ardent friend expos\u2019d his mind: \u201cAll this, alone, and leaving me behind!", " So Salius lay extended on the plain; Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend The victor to the goal, who vanquish\u2019d by his friend. Next Helymus; and then Diores came, By two misfortunes made the third in fame. But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd; Urges his cause may in the court be heard; And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr\u2019d. But favour for Euryalus appears; His blooming beauty, with his tender tears, Had brib\u2019d the judges for the promis\u2019d prize. Besides, Diores fills the court with cries, Who vainly reaches at the last reward, If the first palm on Salius be conferr\u2019d. Then thus the prince: \u201cLet no disputes arise: Where fortune plac\u2019d it, I award the prize. But fortune\u2019s errors give me leave to mend, At least to pity my deserving friend.\u201d He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws (Pond\u2019rous with shaggy mane and golden paws) A lion\u2019s hide: to Salius this he gives. Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves. \u201cIf such rewards to vanquish\u2019d men are due.\u201d He said, \u201cand falling is to rise by you, What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim, Who merited the first rewards and fame? In falling, both an equal fortune tried; Would fortune for my fall so well provide!\u201d With this he pointed to his face, and show\u2019d His hand and all his habit smear\u2019d with blood. Th\u2019 indulgent father of the people smil\u2019d, And caus\u2019d to be produc\u2019d an ample shield, Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought, Long since from Neptune\u2019s bars in triumph brought.", " They saw the pair; for, thro\u2019 the doubtful shade, His shining helm Euryalus betray\u2019d, On which the moon with full reflection play\u2019d. \u201c\u2019Tis not for naught,\u201d cried Volscens from the crowd, \u201cThese men go there;\u201d then rais\u2019d his voice aloud: \u201cStand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent? From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?\u201d Silent they scud away, and haste their flight To neighb\u2019ring woods, and trust themselves to night. The speedy horse all passages belay, And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way, And watch each entrance of the winding wood. Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood, Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn; Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn. The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey, And fear, misled the younger from his way. But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste, And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass\u2019d, And Alban plains, from Alba\u2019s name so call\u2019d, Where King Latinus then his oxen stall\u2019d; Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground, And miss\u2019d his friend, and cast his eyes around: \u201cAh wretch!\u201d he cried, \u201cwhere have I left behind Th\u2019 unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find? Or what way take?\u201d Again he ventures back, And treads the mazes of his former track. He winds the wood, and, list\u2019ning, hears the noise Of tramping coursers, and the riders\u2019 voice. The sound approach\u2019d; and suddenly he view\u2019d The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued, Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.", " Yet, for his galley sav\u2019d, the grateful prince Is pleas\u2019d th\u2019 unhappy chief to recompense. Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care, Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair. From thence his way the Trojan hero bent Into the neighb\u2019ring plain, with mountains pent, Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. Full in the midst of this fair valley stood A native theatre, which, rising slow By just degrees, o\u2019erlook\u2019d the ground below. High on a sylvan throne the leader sate; A num\u2019rous train attend in solemn state. Here those that in the rapid course delight, Desire of honour and the prize invite. The rival runners without order stand; The Trojans mix\u2019d with the Sicilian band. First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears; Euryalus a boy of blooming years, With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown\u2019d; Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown\u2019d. Diores next, of Priam\u2019s royal race, Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place; But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, And Salius his from Arcananian earth; Then two Sicilian youths, the names of these, Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes: Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, And owning old Acestes for their head; With sev\u2019ral others of ignobler name, Whom time has not deliver\u2019d o\u2019er to fame. To these the hero thus his thoughts explain\u2019d, In words which gen\u2019ral approbation gain\u2019d: \u201cOne common largess is for all design\u2019d, The vanquish\u2019d and the victor shall be join\u2019d, Two darts of polish\u2019d steel and Gnosian wood, A silver-studded ax alike bestow\u2019d."], "Who kills Pallas?": [" To the rude shock of war both armies came; Their leaders equal, and their strength the same. The rear so press\u2019d the front, they could not wield Their angry weapons, to dispute the field. Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: Of equal youth and beauty both appear, But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air. Their congress in the field great Jove withstands: Both doom\u2019d to fall, but fall by greater hands. Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief Of Lausus\u2019 danger, urging swift relief. With his driv\u2019n chariot he divides the crowd, And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud: \u201cLet none presume his needless aid to join; Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: To this right hand is Pallas only due; O were his father here, my just revenge to view!\u201d From the forbidden space his men retir\u2019d. Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir\u2019d; Survey\u2019d him o\u2019er and o\u2019er with wond\u2019ring sight, Struck with his haughty mien, and tow\u2019ring height. Then to the king: \u201cYour empty vaunts forbear; Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear; Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name; Jove is impartial, and to both the same.\u201d He said, and to the void advanc\u2019d his pace: Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face. Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light, Address\u2019d himself on foot to single fight. And, as a lion\u2014when he spies from far A bull that seems to meditate the war, Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand\u2014 Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand: Imagine eager Turnus not more slow, To rush from high on his unequal foe.", " Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies. His armour-bearer first, and next he kills His charioteer, intrench\u2019d betwixt the wheels And his lov\u2019d horses; last invades their lord; Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword: The gasping head flies off; a purple flood Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood, Which, by the spurning heels dispers\u2019d around, The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground. Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong, He slew, and then Serranus fair and young. From dice and wine the youth retir\u2019d to rest, And puff\u2019d the fumy god from out his breast: Ev\u2019n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play\u2014 More lucky, had it lasted till the day. The famish\u2019d lion thus, with hunger bold, O\u2019erleaps the fences of the nightly fold, And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw. Nor with less rage Euryalus employs The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys; But on th\u2019 ignoble crowd his fury flew; He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew. Oppress\u2019d with heavy sleep the former fell, But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all: Behind a spacious jar he slink\u2019d for fear; The fatal iron found and reach\u2019d him there; For, as he rose, it pierc\u2019d his naked side, And, reeking, thence return\u2019d in crimson dyed. The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood; The purple soul comes floating in the flood. Now, where Messapus quarter\u2019d, they arrive.", " Thus was his friend interr\u2019d; and deathless fame Still to the lofty cape consigns his name. These rites perform\u2019d, the prince, without delay, Hastes to the nether world his destin\u2019d way. Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent; And here th\u2019 access a gloomy grove defends, And there th\u2019 unnavigable lake extends, O\u2019er whose unhappy waters, void of light, No bird presumes to steer his airy flight; Such deadly stenches from the depths arise, And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies. From hence the Grecian bards their legends make, And give the name Avernus to the lake. Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught, For sacrifice the pious hero brought. The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns; Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns, Invoking Hecate hither to repair: A pow\u2019rful name in hell and upper air. The sacred priests with ready knives bereave The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night (The sable wool without a streak of white) Aeneas offers; and, by fate\u2019s decree, A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee, With holocausts he Pluto\u2019s altar fills; Sev\u2019n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills; Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours; Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours. Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun, Nor ended till the next returning sun. Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance, And howling dogs in glimm\u2019ring light advance, Ere Hecate came.", " Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, Whose mighty trunk had better grac\u2019d the wood, If Pallas had arriv\u2019d, with equal length Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd\u2019st in vain? Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, And, after Pallas\u2019 death, live ling\u2019ring on, \u2019Tis to behold his vengeance for my son. I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead. My son and I expect it from his hand; \u2019Tis all that he can give, or we demand. Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, To greet my Pallas with such news below.\u201d The morn had now dispell\u2019d the shades of night, Restoring toils, when she restor\u2019d the light. The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command To raise the piles along the winding strand. Their friends convey the dead fun\u2019ral fires; Black smould\u2019ring smoke from the green wood expires; The light of heav\u2019n is chok\u2019d, and the new day retires. Then thrice around the kindled piles they go (For ancient custom had ordain\u2019d it so) Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw The spoils, in battle taken from the foe: Helms, bits emboss\u2019d, and swords of shining steel; One casts a target, one a chariot wheel; Some to their fellows their own arms restore: The falchions which in luckless fight they bore, Their bucklers pierc\u2019d, their darts bestow\u2019d in vain, And shiver\u2019d lances gather\u2019d from the plain."], "How does Junoget Turnus away from battle and onto a ship?": [" Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " But young Ascanius, in his camp distress\u2019d, By your insulting foes is hardly press\u2019d. Th\u2019 Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host, Advance in order on the Latian coast: To cut their way the Daunian chief designs, Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines. Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light, First arm thy soldiers for th\u2019 ensuing fight: Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield, And bear aloft th\u2019 impenetrable shield. Tomorrow\u2019s sun, unless my skill be vain, Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain.\u201d Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force Push\u2019d on the vessel in her wat\u2019ry course; For well she knew the way. Impell\u2019d behind, The ship flew forward, and outstripp\u2019d the wind. The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause, The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws. Then thus he pray\u2019d, and fix\u2019d on heav\u2019n his eyes: \u201cHear thou, great Mother of the deities. With turrets crown\u2019d! (on Ida\u2019s holy hill Fierce tigers, rein\u2019d and curb\u2019d, obey thy will.) Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight; And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right.\u201d He said no more. And now renewing day Had chas\u2019d the shadows of the night away. He charg\u2019d the soldiers, with preventing care, Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare; Warn\u2019d of th\u2019 ensuing fight, and bade \u2019em hope the war. Now, his lofty poop, he view\u2019d below His camp incompass\u2019d, and th\u2019 inclosing foe. His blazing shield, imbrac\u2019d, he held on high; The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply.", " In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood; The soul comes issuing with the vital blood: He falls; his arms upon his body sound; And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground. Turnus bestrode the corpse: \u201cArcadians, hear,\u201d Said he; \u201cmy message to your master bear: Such as the sire deserv\u2019d, the son I send; It costs him dear to be the Phrygians\u2019 friend. The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow, Unask\u2019d, to rest his wand\u2019ring ghost below.\u201d He said, and trampled down with all the force Of his left foot, and spurn\u2019d the wretched corse; Then snatch\u2019d the shining belt, with gold inlaid; The belt Eurytion\u2019s artful hands had made, Where fifty fatal brides, express\u2019d to sight, All in the compass of one mournful night, Depriv\u2019d their bridegrooms of returning light. In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore. O mortals, blind in fate, who never know To bear high fortune, or endure the low! The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain, Shall wish untouch\u2019d the trophies of the slain; Shall wish the fatal belt were far away, And curse the dire remembrance of the day. The sad Arcadians, from th\u2019 unhappy field, Bear back the breathless body on a shield. O grace and grief of war! at once restor\u2019d, With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor\u2019d! One day first sent thee to the fighting field, Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill\u2019d; One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.", " Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste, Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass\u2019d. Scarce had he reach\u2019d the prow: Saturnia\u2019s hand The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land. With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea, And measures back with speed her former way. Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe, And sends his slaughter\u2019d troops to shades below. The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, And flew sublime, and vanish\u2019d in a cloud. Too late young Turnus the delusion found, Far on the sea, still making from the ground. Then, thankless for a life redeem\u2019d by shame, With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame, Fearful besides of what in fight had pass\u2019d, His hands and haggard eyes to heav\u2019n he cast; \u201cO Jove!\u201d he cried, \u201cfor what offence have I Deserv\u2019d to bear this endless infamy? Whence am I forc\u2019d, and whether am I borne? How, and with what reproach, shall I return? Shall ever I behold the Latian plain, Or see Laurentum\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs again? What will they say of their deserting chief The war was mine: I fly from their relief; I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave; And ev\u2019n from hence their dying groans receive. Here, overmatch\u2019d in fight, in heaps they lie; There, scatter\u2019d o\u2019er the fields, ignobly fly. Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive! Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve! On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive; Or set me shipwreck\u2019d on some desert shore, Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more, Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame, Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.\u201d Thus Turnus rav\u2019d, and various fates revolv\u2019d: The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv\u2019d."], "How long is theburial truce to which the two armies agree?": [" could this frail being give, That I have been so covetous to live? To see my son, and such a son, resign His life, a ransom for preserving mine! And am I then preserv\u2019d, and art thou lost? How much too dear has that redemption cost! \u2019Tis now my bitter banishment I feel: This is a wound too deep for time to heal. My guilt thy growing virtues did defame; My blackness blotted thy unblemish\u2019d name. Chas\u2019d from a throne, abandon\u2019d, and exil\u2019d For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild: I ow\u2019d my people these, and, from their hate, With less resentment could have borne my fate. And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight Of hated men, and of more hated light: But will not long.\u201d With that he rais\u2019d from ground His fainting limbs, that stagger\u2019d with his wound; Yet, with a mind resolv\u2019d, and unappall\u2019d With pains or perils, for his courser call\u2019d Well-mouth\u2019d, well-manag\u2019d, whom himself did dress With daily care, and mounted with success; His aid in arms, his ornament in peace. Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke, The steed seem\u2019d sensible, while thus he spoke: \u201cO Rhoebus, we have liv\u2019d too long for me\u2014 If life and long were terms that could agree! This day thou either shalt bring back the head And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead; This day thou either shalt revenge my woe, For murder\u2019d Lausus, on his cruel foe; Or, if inexorable fate deny Our conquest, with thy conquer\u2019d master die: For, after such a lord, I rest secure, Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure.\u201d He said; and straight th\u2019 officious courser kneels, To take his wonted weight.", " Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew, Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew, And sanguine streams the slipp\u2019ry ground embrue. First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace, He cries aloud, to make the combat cease: \u201cRutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire! The fight is mine; and me the gods require. \u2019Tis just that I should vindicate alone The broken truce, or for the breach atone. This day shall free from wars th\u2019 Ausonian state, Or finish my misfortunes in my fate.\u201d Both armies from their bloody work desist, And, bearing backward, form a spacious list. The Trojan hero, who receiv\u2019d from fame The welcome sound, and heard the champion\u2019s name, Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls, Greedy of war where greater glory calls. He springs to fight, exulting in his force His jointed armour rattles in the course. Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows, Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows, His head divine obscure in clouds he hides, And shakes the sounding forest on his sides. The nations, overaw\u2019d, surcease the fight; Immovable their bodies, fix\u2019d their sight. Ev\u2019n death stands still; nor from above they throw Their darts, nor drive their batt\u2019ring-rams below. In silent order either army stands, And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands. Th\u2019 Ausonian king beholds, with wond\u2019ring sight, Two mighty champions match\u2019d in single fight, Born under climes remote, and brought by fate, With swords to try their titles to the state.", " You beg a truce, which I would gladly give, Not only for the slain, but those who live. I came not hither but by Heav\u2019n\u2019s command, And sent by fate to share the Latian land. Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied My proffer\u2019d friendship, and my promis\u2019d bride; Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try His cause in arms, to conquer or to die. My right and his are in dispute: the slain Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. In equal arms let us alone contend; And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. This is the way (so tell him) to possess The royal virgin, and restore the peace. Bear this message back, with ample leave, That your slain friends may fun\u2019ral rites receive.\u201d Thus having said\u2014th\u2019 embassadors, amaz\u2019d, Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz\u2019d. Drances, their chief, who harbour\u2019d in his breast Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess\u2019d, Broke silence first, and to the godlike man, With graceful action bowing, thus began: \u201cAuspicious prince, in arms a mighty name, But yet whose actions far transcend your fame; Would I your justice or your force express, Thought can but equal; and all words are less. Your answer we shall thankfully relate, And favours granted to the Latian state. If wish\u2019d success our labour shall attend, Think peace concluded, and the king your friend: Let Turnus leave the realm to your command, And seek alliance in some other land: Build you the city which your fates assign; We shall be proud in the great work to join.\u201d Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade The rest impower\u2019d, that soon a truce is made.", " A cloud of blinding dust is rais\u2019d around, Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground. Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far Beheld the progress of the moving war: With him the Latins view\u2019d the cover\u2019d plains, And the chill blood ran backward in their veins. Juturna saw th\u2019 advancing troops appear, And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear. Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train, Clos\u2019d in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore From the mid ocean, drives the waves before; The painful hind with heavy heart foresees The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees; With like impetuous rage the prince appears Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. And now both armies shock in open field; Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill\u2019d. Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain (All fam\u2019d in arms, and of the Latian train) By Gyas\u2019, Mnestheus\u2019, and Achates\u2019 hand. The fatal augur falls, by whose command The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued With Trojan blood, th\u2019 unhappy fight renew\u2019d. Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky, And o\u2019er the field the frighted Latins fly. The prince disdains the dastards to pursue, Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few; Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain, He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain. Juturna heard, and, seiz\u2019d with mortal fear, Forc\u2019d from the beam her brother\u2019s charioteer; Assumes his shape, his armour, and his mien, And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen."], "Which woman slaysmany Trojans in battle?": [" Him soon she singled from the flying train, And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain: \u201cVain hunter, didst thou think thro\u2019 woods to chase The savage herd, a vile and trembling race? Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory: A woman warrior was too strong for thee. Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu\u2019ror\u2019s name, Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame.\u201d Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew, The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew; But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends Above the gorget, where his helmet ends, And o\u2019er the shield which his left side defends. Orsilochus and she their courses ply: He seems to follow, and she seems to fly; But in a narrower ring she makes the race; And then he flies, and she pursues the chase. Gath\u2019ring at length on her deluded foe, She swings her ax, and rises to the blow Full on the helm behind, with such a sway The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way: He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace; Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face. Astonish\u2019d Aunus just arrives by chance, To see his fall; nor farther dares advance; But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye, He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly; Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat, (At least while fortune favour\u2019d his deceit,) Cries out aloud: \u201cWhat courage have you shown, Who trust your courser\u2019s strength, and not your own? Forego the vantage of your horse, alight, And then on equal terms begin the fight: It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can, When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,\u201d He said.", " Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field; His father\u2019s hydra fills his ample shield: A hundred serpents hiss about the brims; The son of Hercules he justly seems By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs; Of heav\u2019nly part, and part of earthly blood, A mortal woman mixing with a god. For strong Alcides, after he had slain The triple Geryon, drove from conquer\u2019d Spain His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led, On Tuscan Tiber\u2019s flow\u2019ry banks they fed. Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove The priestess Rhea found, and forc\u2019d to love. For arms, his men long piles and jav\u2019lins bore; And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore. Like Hercules himself his son appears, In salvage pomp; a lion\u2019s hide he wears; About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin; The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin. Thus, like the god his father, homely dress\u2019d, He strides into the hall, a horrid guest. Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came, (Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,) Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear: Arm\u2019d Argive horse they led, and in the front appear. Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain\u2019s height With rapid course descending to the fight; They rush along; the rattling woods give way; The branches bend before their sweepy sway. Nor was Praeneste\u2019s founder wanting there, Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber: Found in the fire, and foster\u2019d in the plains, A shepherd and a king at once he reigns, And leads to Turnus\u2019 aid his country swains.", " Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose, Before the love-sick lady heard the news; And move her tender mind, by slow degrees, To suffer what the sov\u2019reign pow\u2019r decrees: Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say. They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey. But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise: (What arts can blind a jealous woman\u2019s eyes!) She was the first to find the secret fraud, Before the fatal news was blaz\u2019d abroad. Love the first motions of the lover hears, Quick to presage, and ev\u2019n in safety fears. Nor impious Fame was wanting to report The ships repair\u2019d, the Trojans\u2019 thick resort, And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court. Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound, And impotent of mind, she roves the city round. Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear, When, from afar, their nightly god they hear, And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear. At length she finds the dear perfidious man; Prevents his form\u2019d excuse, and thus began: \u201cBase and ungrateful! could you hope to fly, And undiscover\u2019d scape a lover\u2019s eye? Nor could my kindness your compassion move. Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love? Or is the death of a despairing queen Not worth preventing, tho\u2019 too well foreseen? Ev\u2019n when the wintry winds command your stay, You dare the tempests, and defy the sea. False as you are, suppose you were not bound To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound; Were Troy restor\u2019d, and Priam\u2019s happy reign, Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?", " There stood a tow\u2019r, amazing to the sight, Built up of beams, and of stupendous height: Art, and the nature of the place, conspir\u2019d To furnish all the strength that war requir\u2019d. To level this, the bold Italians join; The wary Trojans obviate their design; With weighty stones o\u2019erwhelm their troops below, Shoot thro\u2019 the loopholes, and sharp jav\u2019lins throw. Turnus, the chief, toss\u2019d from his thund\u2019ring hand Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand: It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; The planks were season\u2019d, and the timber dry. Contagion caught the posts; it spread along, Scorch\u2019d, and to distance drove the scatter\u2019d throng. The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain, Still gath\u2019ring fast upon the trembling train; Till, crowding to the corners of the wall, Down the defence and the defenders fall. The mighty flaw makes heav\u2019n itself resound: The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground. The tow\u2019r, that follow\u2019d on the fallen crew, Whelm\u2019d o\u2019er their heads, and buried whom it slew: Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent; All the same equal ruin underwent. Young Lycus and Helenor only scape; Sav\u2019d\u2014how, they know not\u2014from the steepy leap. Helenor, elder of the two: by birth, On one side royal, one a son of earth, Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare, And sent her boasted bastard to the war (A privilege which none but freemen share). Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield: No marks of honour charg\u2019d its empty field."], "Who, besidesDido, commits suicide?": [" \u201c\u2018Besides, if faith to Helenus be due, And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true, Do not this precept of your friend forget, Which therefore more than once I must repeat: Above the rest, great Juno\u2019s name adore; Pay vows to Juno; Juno\u2019s aid implore. Let gifts be to the mighty queen design\u2019d, And mollify with pray\u2019rs her haughty mind. Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free, And you shall safe descend on Italy. Arriv\u2019d at Cumae, when you view the flood Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood, The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find, Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin\u2019d. She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits, The notes and names, inscrib\u2019d, to leafs commits. What she commits to leafs, in order laid, Before the cavern\u2019s entrance are display\u2019d: Unmov\u2019d they lie; but, if a blast of wind Without, or vapours issue from behind, The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air, And she resumes no more her museful care, Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter\u2019d verse, Nor sets in order what the winds disperse. Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid The madness of the visionary maid, And with loud curses leave the mystic shade. \u201c\u2018Think it not loss of time a while to stay, Tho\u2019 thy companions chide thy long delay; Tho\u2019 summon\u2019d to the seas, tho\u2019 pleasing gales Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails: But beg the sacred priestess to relate With willing words, and not to write thy fate."], "What requestdoes Juno make as she finally gives in to Aeneas\u2019s fated victory?": [" But, O! if any ancient blood remains, One drop of all our fathers\u2019, in our veins, That man would I prefer before the rest, Who dar\u2019d his death with an undaunted breast; Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound, To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw\u2019d the ground. But, if we still have fresh recruits in store, If our confederates can afford us more; If the contended field we bravely fought, And not a bloodless victory was bought; Their losses equal\u2019d ours; and, for their slain, With equal fires they fill\u2019d the shining plain; Why thus, unforc\u2019d, should we so tamely yield, And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field? Good unexpected, evils unforeseen, Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene: Some, rais\u2019d aloft, come tumbling down amain; Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again. If Diomede refuse his aid to lend, The great Messapus yet remains our friend: Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours; Th\u2019 Italian chiefs and princes join their pow\u2019rs: Nor least in number, nor in name the last, Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac\u2019d Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon Contains an army in herself alone, And heads a squadron, terrible to sight, With glitt\u2019ring shields, in brazen armour bright. Yet, if the foe a single fight demand, And I alone the public peace withstand; If you consent, he shall not be refus\u2019d, Nor find a hand to victory unus\u2019d. This new Achilles, let him take the field, With fated armour, and Vulcanian shield!", " Such is their toil, and such their busy pains, As exercise the bees in flow\u2019ry plains, When winter past, and summer scarce begun, Invites them forth to labour in the sun; Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense; Some at the gate stand ready to receive The golden burthen, and their friends relieve; All with united force, combine to drive The lazy drones from the laborious hive: With envy stung, they view each other\u2019s deeds; The fragrant work with diligence proceeds. \u201cThrice happy you, whose walls already rise!\u201d Aeneas said, and view\u2019d, with lifted eyes, Their lofty tow\u2019rs; then, ent\u2019ring at the gate, Conceal\u2019d in clouds (prodigious to relate) He mix\u2019d, unmark\u2019d, among the busy throng, Borne by the tide, and pass\u2019d unseen along. Full in the centre of the town there stood, Thick set with trees, a venerable wood. The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground, And digging here, a prosp\u2019rous omen found: From under earth a courser\u2019s head they drew, Their growth and future fortune to foreshew. This fated sign their foundress Juno gave, Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave. Sidonian Dido here with solemn state Did Juno\u2019s temple build, and consecrate, Enrich\u2019d with gifts, and with a golden shrine; But more the goddess made the place divine. On brazen steps the marble threshold rose, And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose: The rafters are with brazen cov\u2019rings crown\u2019d; The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.", " He first in open field defied the prince: But armour scal\u2019d with gold was no defence Against the fated sword, which open\u2019d wide His plated shield, and pierc\u2019d his naked side. Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born, Was from his wretched mother ripp\u2019d and torn; Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee; For his beginning life from biting steel was free. Not far from him was Gyas laid along, Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail\u2019d, Nor valour nor Herculean arms avail\u2019d, Nor their fam\u2019d father, wont in war to go With great Alcides, while he toil\u2019d below. The noisy Pharos next receiv\u2019d his death: Aeneas writh\u2019d his dart, and stopp\u2019d his bawling breath. Then wretched Cydon had receiv\u2019d his doom, Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, And sought with lust obscene polluted joys: The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys, Had not his sev\u2019n bold brethren stopp\u2019d the course Of the fierce champions, with united force. Sev\u2019n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: The rest had reach\u2019d him; but his mother\u2019s care Prevented those, and turn\u2019d aside in air. The prince then call\u2019d Achates, to supply The spears that knew the way to victory\u2014 \u201cThose fatal weapons, which, inur\u2019d to blood, In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain Against our foes, on this contended plain.\u201d He said; then seiz\u2019d a mighty spear, and threw; Which, wing\u2019d with fate, thro\u2019 Maeon\u2019s buckler flew, Pierc\u2019d all the brazen plates, and reach\u2019d his heart: He stagger\u2019d with intolerable smart.", " These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, And the rich present to the prince commends. Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, To their expecting lord with peace return. But jealous Juno, from Pachynus\u2019 height, As she from Argos took her airy flight, Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight. She saw the Trojan and his joyful train Descend upon the shore, desert the main, Design a town, and, with unhop\u2019d success, Th\u2019 embassadors return with promis\u2019d peace. Then, pierc\u2019d with pain, she shook her haughty head, Sigh\u2019d from her inward soul, and thus she said: \u201cO hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! O fates of Troy, which Juno\u2019s fates oppose! Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, But slain revive, and, taken, scape again? When execrable Troy in ashes lay, Thro\u2019 fires and swords and seas they forc\u2019d their way. Then vanquish\u2019d Juno must in vain contend, Her rage disarm\u2019d, her empire at an end. Breathless and tir\u2019d, is all my fury spent? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? As if \u2019twere little from their town to chase, I thro\u2019 the seas pursued their exil\u2019d race; Ingag\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, oppos\u2019d the stormy main; But billows roar\u2019d, and tempests rag\u2019d in vain. What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, When these they overpass, and those they shun? On Tiber\u2019s shores they land, secure of fate, Triumphant o\u2019er the storms and Juno\u2019s hate. Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia\u2019s wrath, Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon; What great offence had either people done?"], "What counteractsAeneas\u2019s impulse to spare Turnus\u2019s life?": [" This dismal news, not from uncertain fame, But sad spectators, to the hero came: His friends upon the brink of ruin stand, Unless reliev\u2019d by his victorious hand. He whirls his sword around, without delay, And hews thro\u2019 adverse foes an ample way, To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud: Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow\u2019d To large deserts, are present to his eyes; His plighted hand, and hospitable ties. Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred, He took in fight, and living victims led, To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire, In sacrifice, before his fun\u2019ral fire. At Magus next he threw: he stoop\u2019d below The flying spear, and shunn\u2019d the promis\u2019d blow; Then, creeping, clasp\u2019d the hero\u2019s knees, and pray\u2019d: \u201cBy young Iulus, by thy father\u2019s shade, O spare my life, and send me back to see My longing sire, and tender progeny! A lofty house I have, and wealth untold, In silver ingots, and in bars of gold: All these, and sums besides, which see no day, The ransom of this one poor life shall pay. If I survive, will Troy the less prevail? A single soul\u2019s too light to turn the scale.\u201d He said. The hero sternly thus replied: \u201cThy bars and ingots, and the sums beside, Leave for thy children\u2019s lot. Thy Turnus broke All rules of war by one relentless stroke, When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone My father\u2019s shadow, but my living son.\u201d Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft, He seiz\u2019d his helm, and dragg\u2019d him with his left; Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath\u2019d, Up to the hilts his shining falchion sheath\u2019d.", " And now the sword, and now the sea took place, That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace. Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main, By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain. Thrice he the sword assay\u2019d, and thrice the flood; But Juno, mov\u2019d with pity, both withstood. And thrice repress\u2019d his rage; strong gales supplied, And push\u2019d the vessel o\u2019er the swelling tide. At length she lands him on his native shores, And to his father\u2019s longing arms restores. Meantime, by Jove\u2019s impulse, Mezentius arm\u2019d, Succeeding Turnus, with his ardour warm\u2019d His fainting friends, reproach\u2019d their shameful flight, Repell\u2019d the victors, and renew\u2019d the fight. Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire; Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire Of wish\u2019d revenge: on him, and him alone, All hands employ\u2019d, and all their darts are thrown. He, like a solid rock by seas inclos\u2019d, To raging winds and roaring waves oppos\u2019d, From his proud summit looking down, disdains Their empty menace, and unmov\u2019d remains. Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead, Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled. At Latagus a weighty stone he flung: His face was flatted, and his helmet rung. But Palmus from behind receives his wound; Hamstring\u2019d he falls, and grovels on the ground: His crest and armour, from his body torn, Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn. Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew. Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew, Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire, The queen produc\u2019d young Paris to his sire: But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain, Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.", " Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join\u2019d? Think\u2019st thou I can my share of glory yield, Or send thee unassisted to the field? Not so my father taught my childhood arms; Born in a siege, and bred among alarms! Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend, Nor of the heav\u2019n-born hero I attend. The thing call\u2019d life, with ease I can disclaim, And think it over-sold to purchase fame.\u201d Then Nisus thus: \u201cAlas! thy tender years Would minister new matter to my fears. So may the gods, who view this friendly strife, Restore me to thy lov\u2019d embrace with life, Condemn\u2019d to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,) This thy request is cruel and unjust. But if some chance\u2014as many chances are, And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war\u2014 If one should reach my head, there let it fall, And spare thy life; I would not perish all. Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date: Live thou to mourn thy love\u2019s unhappy fate; To bear my mangled body from the foe, Or buy it back, and fun\u2019ral rites bestow. Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny, Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply. O let not me the widow\u2019s tears renew! Nor let a mother\u2019s curse my name pursue: Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee, Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily, Her age committing to the seas and wind, When ev\u2019ry weary matron stay\u2019d behind.\u201d To this, Euryalus: \u201cYou plead in vain, And but protract the cause you cannot gain. No more delays, but haste!\u201d With that, he wakes The nodding watch; each to his office takes.", " Clear\u2019d, as I thought, and fully fix\u2019d at length To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength: I bent my knees against the ground; once more The violated myrtle ran with gore. Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb, A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew\u2019d My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued: \u2018Why dost thou thus my buried body rend? O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend! Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood: The tears distil not from the wounded wood; But ev\u2019ry drop this living tree contains Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins. O fly from this unhospitable shore, Warn\u2019d by my fate; for I am Polydore! Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued, Again shoot upward, by my blood renew\u2019d.\u2019 \u201cMy falt\u2019ring tongue and shiv\u2019ring limbs declare My horror, and in bristles rose my hair. When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent, Old Priam, fearful of the war\u2019s event, This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent: Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far From noise and tumults, and destructive war, Committed to the faithless tyrant\u2019s care; Who, when he saw the pow\u2019r of Troy decline, Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join; Broke ev\u2019ry bond of nature and of truth, And murder\u2019d, for his wealth, the royal youth. O sacred hunger of pernicious gold! What bands of faith can impious lucre hold? Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears, I call my father and the Trojan peers; Relate the prodigies of Heav\u2019n, require What he commands, and their advice desire."], "What is the relationship between Aeneas and fate?": [" Aeneas went Sad from the cave, and full of discontent, Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. Achates, the companion of his breast, Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress\u2019d. Walking, they talk\u2019d, and fruitlessly divin\u2019d What friend the priestess by those words design\u2019d. But soon they found an object to deplore: Misenus lay extended on the shore; Son of the God of Winds: none so renown\u2019d The warrior trumpet in the field to sound; With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms. He serv\u2019d great Hector, and was ever near, Not with his trumpet only, but his spear. But by Pelides\u2019 arms when Hector fell, He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well. Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more, He now provokes the sea gods from the shore; With envy Triton heard the martial sound, And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown\u2019d; Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand: The gazing crowd around the body stand. All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate, And hastens to perform the funeral state. In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; The basis broad below, and top advanc\u2019d in air. An ancient wood, fit for the work design\u2019d, (The shady covert of the salvage kind,) The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow\u2019ring pride Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.", " His hands he fills With pointed jav\u2019lins; on his head he lac\u2019d His glitt\u2019ring helm, which terribly was grac\u2019d With waving horsehair, nodding from afar; Then spurr\u2019d his thund\u2019ring steed amidst the war. Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought, Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought Of inborn worth, his lab\u2019ring soul oppress\u2019d, Roll\u2019d in his eyes, and rag\u2019d within his breast. Then loud he call\u2019d Aeneas thrice by name: The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came. \u201cGreat Jove,\u201d he said, \u201cand the far-shooting god, Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!\u201d He spoke no more; but hasten\u2019d, void of fear, And threaten\u2019d with his long protended spear. To whom Mezentius thus: \u201cThy vaunts are vain. My Lausus lies extended on the plain: He\u2019s lost! thy conquest is already won; The wretched sire is murder\u2019d in the son. Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy. Forbear thy threats: my bus\u2019ness is to die; But first receive this parting legacy.\u201d He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent; Another after, and another went. Round in a spacious ring he rides the field, And vainly plies th\u2019 impenetrable shield. Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel\u2019d, Turn\u2019d as he turn\u2019d: the golden orb withstood The strokes, and bore about an iron wood. Impatient of delay, and weary grown, Still to defend, and to defend alone, To wrench the darts which in his buckler light, Urg\u2019d and o\u2019er-labour\u2019d in unequal fight; At length resolv\u2019d, he throws with all his force Full at the temples of the warrior horse.", " Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force. Then Venulus to Diomede they send, To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, Declare the common danger, and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm: \u201cAeneas, landed on the Latian coast, With banish\u2019d gods, and with a baffled host, Yet now aspir\u2019d to conquest of the state, And claim\u2019d a title from the gods and fate; What num\u2019rous nations in his quarrel came, And how they spread his formidable name. What he design\u2019d, what mischief might arise, If fortune favour\u2019d his first enterprise, Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, And common interest, was involv\u2019d in theirs.\u201d While Turnus and th\u2019 allies thus urge the war, The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare."], "What are two of Aeneas's most prominent characteristics?": [" There Ganymede is wrought with living art, Chasing thro\u2019 Ida\u2019s groves the trembling hart: Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue; When from aloft descends, in open view, The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey, With crooked talons bears the boy away. In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes, His guards behold him soaring thro\u2019 the skies, And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries. Mnestheus the second victor was declar\u2019d; And, summon\u2019d there, the second prize he shar\u2019d. A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore, More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore, In single combat on the Trojan shore: This was ordain\u2019d for Mnestheus to possess; In war for his defence, for ornament in peace. Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold, But yet so pond\u2019rous with its plates of gold, That scarce two servants could the weight sustain; Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o\u2019er the plain Pursued and lightly seiz\u2019d the Trojan train. The third, succeeding to the last reward, Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar\u2019d, With figures prominent, and richly wrought, And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought. Thus all, rewarded by the hero\u2019s hands, Their conqu\u2019ring temples bound with purple bands; And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock, Brought back his galley shatter\u2019d with the shock. Forlorn she look\u2019d, without an aiding oar, And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore. As when a snake, surpris\u2019d upon the road, Is crush\u2019d athwart her body by the load Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound Her belly bruis\u2019d, and trodden to the ground: In vain, with loosen\u2019d curls, she crawls along; Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue; Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales; But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails: So slowly to the port the Centaur tends, But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.", " What god can tell, what numbers can display, The various labours of that fatal day; What chiefs and champions fell on either side, In combat slain, or by what deaths they died; Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill\u2019d; Who shar\u2019d the fame and fortune of the field! Jove, could\u2019st thou view, and not avert thy sight, Two jarring nations join\u2019d in cruel fight, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found, Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground; Betwixt his ribs the jav\u2019lin drove so just, It reach\u2019d his heart, nor needs a second thrust. Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail\u2019d Diores, and in equal fight prevail\u2019d. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, Whom without respite at one charge he slew: Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress\u2019d, And sad Onythes, added to the rest, Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore. Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore, And from Apollo\u2019s fane to battle sent, O\u2019erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent. Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill\u2019d, Who long had shunn\u2019d the dangers of the field: On Lerna\u2019s lake a silent life he led, And with his nets and angle earn\u2019d his bread; Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew, But wisely from th\u2019 infectious world withdrew: Poor was his house; his father\u2019s painful hand Discharg\u2019d his rent, and plow\u2019d another\u2019s land.", " But now assist the rites, with garlands crown\u2019d.\u201d He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound. Then Helymus, by his example led, And old Acestes, each adorn\u2019d his head; Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, His temples tied, and all the Trojan race. Aeneas then advanc\u2019d amidst the train, By thousands follow\u2019d thro\u2019 the flow\u2019ry plain, To great Anchises\u2019 tomb; which when he found, He pour\u2019d to Bacchus, on the hallow\u2019d ground, Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, And two from offer\u2019d bulls of purple gore, With roses then the sepulcher he strow\u2019d And thus his father\u2019s ghost bespoke aloud: \u201cHail, O ye holy manes! hail again, Paternal ashes, now review\u2019d in vain! The gods permitted not, that you, with me, Should reach the promis\u2019d shores of Italy, Or Tiber\u2019s flood, what flood soe\u2019er it be.\u201d Scarce had he finish\u2019d, when, with speckled pride, A serpent from the tomb began to glide; His hugy bulk on sev\u2019n high volumes roll\u2019d; Blue was his breadth of back, but streak\u2019d with scaly gold: Thus riding on his curls, he seem\u2019d to pass A rolling fire along, and singe the grass. More various colours thro\u2019 his body run, Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun. Betwixt the rising altars, and around, The sacred monster shot along the ground; With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass\u2019d, And with his lolling tongue assay\u2019d the taste: Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest Within the hollow tomb retir\u2019d to rest.", " Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear Two lions carv\u2019d, which rising Ida bear\u2014 Ida, to wand\u2019ring Trojans ever dear. Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate, Revolving war\u2019s events, and various fate. His left young Pallas kept, fix\u2019d to his side, And oft of winds enquir\u2019d, and of the tide; Oft of the stars, and of their wat\u2019ry way; And what he suffer\u2019d both by land and sea. Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring! The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing, Which follow\u2019d great Aeneas to the war: Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare. A thousand youths brave Massicus obey, Borne in the Tiger thro\u2019 the foaming sea; From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care: For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear. Fierce Abas next: his men bright armour wore; His stern Apollo\u2019s golden statue bore. Six hundred Populonia sent along, All skill\u2019d in martial exercise, and strong. Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins, An isle renown\u2019d for steel, and unexhausted mines. Asylas on his prow the third appears, Who heav\u2019n interprets, and the wand\u2019ring stars; From offer\u2019d entrails prodigies expounds, And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. A thousand spears in warlike order stand, Sent by the Pisans under his command. Fair Astur follows in the wat\u2019ry field, Proud of his manag\u2019d horse and painted shield. Gravisca, noisome from the neighb\u2019ring fen, And his own Caere, sent three hundred men; With those which Minio\u2019s fields and Pyrgi gave, All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave."], "Which of the following is a major difference between Aeneas and Turnus?": [" Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " Following the blow, he seiz\u2019d his curling crown With his left hand; his other cast him down. The prostrate body with his knees he press\u2019d, And plung\u2019d his holy poniard in his breast. While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued The shepherd Alsus thro\u2019 the flying crowd, Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow Full on the front of his unwary foe. The broad ax enters with a crashing sound, And cleaves the chin with one continued wound; Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress\u2019d, And seal\u2019d their heavy lids in endless rest. But good Aeneas rush\u2019d amid the bands; Bare was his head, and naked were his hands, In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud: \u201cWhat sudden rage, what new desire of blood, Inflames your alter\u2019d minds? O Trojans, cease From impious arms, nor violate the peace! By human sanctions, and by laws divine, The terms are all agreed; the war is mine. Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue; This hand alone shall right the gods and you: Our injur\u2019d altars, and their broken vow, To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe.\u201d Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defence, A winged arrow struck the pious prince. But, whether from some human hand it came, Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame: No human hand or hostile god was found, To boast the triumph of so base a wound. When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain, His chiefs dismay\u2019d, his troops a fainting train, Th\u2019 unhop\u2019d event his heighten\u2019d soul inspires: At once his arms and coursers he requires; Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains, And with a ready hand assumes the reins.", " if any here Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear; If there be here,\u201d she said, \u201cwho dare maintain My right, nor think the name of mother vain; Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair, And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare.\u201d Amata\u2019s breast the Fury thus invades, And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades; Then, when she found her venom spread so far, The royal house embroil\u2019d in civil war, Rais\u2019d on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies, And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies. His town, as fame reports, was built of old By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold, Who fled her father\u2019s rage, and, with a train Of following Argives, thro\u2019 the stormy main, Driv\u2019n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign. \u2019Twas Ardua once; now Ardea\u2019s name it bears; Once a fair city, now consum\u2019d with years. Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay, Betwixt the confines of the night and day, Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried The foulness of th\u2019 infernal form to hide. Propp\u2019d on a staff, she takes a trembling mien: Her face is furrow\u2019d, and her front obscene; Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws; Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws; Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound, Her temples with an olive wreath are crown\u2019d. Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane Of Juno, now she seem\u2019d, and thus began, Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man: \u201cShall Turnus then such endless toil sustain In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?", " Mark how the shifting winds from west arise, And what collected night involves the skies! Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea, Much less against the tempest force their way. \u2019Tis fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. Not far from hence, if I observ\u2019d aright The southing of the stars, and polar light, Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores In safety we may reach with struggling oars.\u201d Aeneas then replied: \u201cToo sure I find We strive in vain against the seas and wind: Now shift your sails; what place can please me more Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, Whose hallow\u2019d earth Anchises\u2019 bones contains, And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?\u201d The course resolv\u2019d, before the western wind They scud amain, and make the port assign\u2019d. Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, Beheld the fleet descending on the land; And, not unmindful of his ancient race, Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, And held the hero in a strict embrace. Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, And either hand a pointed jav\u2019lin bore. His mother was a dame of Dardan blood; His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. He welcomes his returning friends ashore With plenteous country cates and homely store. Now, when the following morn had chas\u2019d away The flying stars, and light restor\u2019d the day, Aeneas call\u2019d the Trojan troops around, And thus bespoke them from a rising ground: \u201cOffspring of heav\u2019n, divine Dardanian race!"], "Why does Dido lose the support of her citizens?": [" Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are: A people rude in peace, and rough in war. The rising city, which from far you see, Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. Phoenician Dido rules the growing state, Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother\u2019s hate. Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, Possess\u2019d fair Dido\u2019s bed; and either heart At once was wounded with an equal dart. Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway\u2019d: One who condemn\u2019d divine and human laws. Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, With steel invades his brother\u2019s life by stealth; Before the sacred altar made him bleed, And long from her conceal\u2019d the cruel deed. Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin\u2019d, To soothe his sister, and delude her mind. At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares, And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. The cruel altars and his fate he tells, And the dire secret of his house reveals, Then warns the widow, with her household gods, To seek a refuge in remote abodes. Last, to support her in so long a way, He shows her where his hidden treasure lay. Admonish\u2019d thus, and seiz\u2019d with mortal fright, The queen provides companions of her flight: They meet, and all combine to leave the state, Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.", " O citizens, we wage unequal war, With men not only Heav\u2019n\u2019s peculiar care, But Heav\u2019n\u2019s own race; unconquer\u2019d in the field, Or, conquer\u2019d, yet unknowing how to yield. What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down: Our hopes must centre on ourselves alone. Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain, You see too well; nor need my words explain. Vanquish\u2019d without resource; laid flat by fate; Factions within, a foe without the gate! Not but I grant that all perform\u2019d their parts With manly force, and with undaunted hearts: With our united strength the war we wag\u2019d; With equal numbers, equal arms, engag\u2019d. You see th\u2019 event.\u2014Now hear what I propose, To save our friends, and satisfy our foes. A tract of land the Latins have possess\u2019d Along the Tiber, stretching to the west, Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till, And their mix\u2019d cattle graze the fruitful hill. Those mountains fill\u2019d with firs, that lower land, If you consent, the Trojan shall command, Call\u2019d into part of what is ours; and there, On terms agreed, the common country share. There let them build and settle, if they please; Unless they choose once more to cross the seas, In search of seats remote from Italy, And from unwelcome inmates set us free. Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed, Or twice as many more, if more they need. Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood Runs equal with the margin of the flood: Let them the number and the form assign; The care and cost of all the stores be mine.", " Your instant arms against the town prepare, The source of mischief, and the seat of war. This day the Latian tow\u2019rs, that mate the sky, Shall level with the plain in ashes lie: The people shall be slaves, unless in time They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime. Twice have our foes been vanquish\u2019d on the plain: Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain? Your force against the perjur\u2019d city bend. There it began, and there the war shall end. The peace profan\u2019d our rightful arms requires; Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires.\u201d He finish\u2019d; and, one soul inspiring all, Form\u2019d in a wedge, the foot approach the wall. Without the town, an unprovided train Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain. Some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear, And those they toss aloft, and these they rear: The flames now launch\u2019d, the feather\u2019d arrows fly, And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky. Advancing to the front, the hero stands, And, stretching out to heav\u2019n his pious hands, Attests the gods, asserts his innocence, Upbraids with breach of faith th\u2019 Ausonian prince; Declares the royal honour doubly stain\u2019d, And twice the rites of holy peace profan\u2019d. Dissenting clamours in the town arise; Each will be heard, and all at once advise. One part for peace, and one for war contends; Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends. The helpless king is hurried in the throng, And, whate\u2019er tide prevails, is borne along.", " What should he next attempt? what arms employ, What fruitless force, to free the captive boy? Or desperate should he rush and lose his life, With odds oppress\u2019d, in such unequal strife? Resolv\u2019d at length, his pointed spear he shook; And, casting on the moon a mournful look: \u201cGuardian of groves, and goddess of the night, Fair queen,\u201d he said, \u201cdirect my dart aright. If e\u2019er my pious father, for my sake, Did grateful off\u2019rings on thy altars make, Or I increas\u2019d them with my sylvan toils, And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils, Give me to scatter these.\u201d Then from his ear He pois\u2019d, and aim\u2019d, and launch\u2019d the trembling spear. The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove, Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove; Pierc\u2019d his thin armour, drank his vital blood, And in his body left the broken wood. He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death, And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.

Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied My proffer\u2019d friendship, and my promis\u2019d bride; Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.

Your answer we shall thankfully relate, And favours granted to the Latian state.

Fierce Turnus view\u2019d the Trojan from afar, And launch\u2019d his jav\u2019lin from his lofty car; Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow, And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, Wrench\u2019d from his feeble hold the shining sword, And plung\u2019d it in the bosom of its lord. \u201cPossess,\u201d said he, \u201cthe fruit of all thy pains, And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains. Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand; Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!\u201d Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew, Whom o\u2019er his neck his flound\u2019ring courser threw. As when loud Boreas, with his blust\u2019ring train, Stoops from above, incumbent on the main; Where\u2019er he flies, he drives the rack before, And rolls the billows on th\u2019 Aegaean shore: So, where resistless Turnus takes his course, The scatter\u2019d squadrons bend before his force; His crest of horses\u2019 hair is blown behind By adverse air, and rustles in the wind. This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain, And, as the chariot roll\u2019d along the plain, Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz\u2019d the rein. Thus hung in air, he still retain\u2019d his hold, The coursers frighted, and their course controll\u2019d.

Now let him perish, since you hold it good, And glut the Trojans with his pious blood. Yet from our lineage he derives his name, And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came; Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine, And offers daily incense at your shrine.\u201d Then shortly thus the sov\u2019reign god replied: \u201cSince in my pow\u2019r and goodness you confide, If for a little space, a lengthen\u2019d span, You beg reprieve for this expiring man, I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence From instant fate, and can so far dispense. But, if some secret meaning lies beneath, To save the short-liv\u2019d youth from destin\u2019d death, Or if a farther thought you entertain, To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.\u201d To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes: \u201cAnd what if that request, your tongue denies, Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve, But length of certain life, to Turnus give?"], "Which deity is angry with Aeneas at the beginning of the poem?": [" Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " He first in open field defied the prince: But armour scal\u2019d with gold was no defence Against the fated sword, which open\u2019d wide His plated shield, and pierc\u2019d his naked side. Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born, Was from his wretched mother ripp\u2019d and torn; Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee; For his beginning life from biting steel was free. Not far from him was Gyas laid along, Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail\u2019d, Nor valour nor Herculean arms avail\u2019d, Nor their fam\u2019d father, wont in war to go With great Alcides, while he toil\u2019d below. The noisy Pharos next receiv\u2019d his death: Aeneas writh\u2019d his dart, and stopp\u2019d his bawling breath. Then wretched Cydon had receiv\u2019d his doom, Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, And sought with lust obscene polluted joys: The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys, Had not his sev\u2019n bold brethren stopp\u2019d the course Of the fierce champions, with united force. Sev\u2019n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: The rest had reach\u2019d him; but his mother\u2019s care Prevented those, and turn\u2019d aside in air. The prince then call\u2019d Achates, to supply The spears that knew the way to victory\u2014 \u201cThose fatal weapons, which, inur\u2019d to blood, In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain Against our foes, on this contended plain.\u201d He said; then seiz\u2019d a mighty spear, and threw; Which, wing\u2019d with fate, thro\u2019 Maeon\u2019s buckler flew, Pierc\u2019d all the brazen plates, and reach\u2019d his heart: He stagger\u2019d with intolerable smart.", " For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood Were swell\u2019d with bodies, and were drunk with blood? \u2019Tis true, a soldier can small honour gain, And boast no conquest, from a woman slain: Yet shall the fact not pass without applause, Of vengeance taken in so just a cause; The punish\u2019d crime shall set my soul at ease, And murm\u2019ring manes of my friends appease.\u2019 Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light Spread o\u2019er the place; and, shining heav\u2019nly bright, My mother stood reveal\u2019d before my sight Never so radiant did her eyes appear; Not her own star confess\u2019d a light so clear: Great in her charms, as when on gods above She looks, and breathes herself into their love. She held my hand, the destin\u2019d blow to break; Then from her rosy lips began to speak: \u2018My son, from whence this madness, this neglect Of my commands, and those whom I protect? Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind. Look if your helpless father yet survive, Or if Ascanius or Creusa live. Around your house the greedy Grecians err; And these had perish\u2019d in the nightly war, But for my presence and protecting care. Not Helen\u2019s face, nor Paris, was in fault; But by the gods was this destruction brought. Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve The mists and films that mortal eyes involve, Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see The shape of each avenging deity. Enlighten\u2019d thus, my just commands fulfil, Nor fear obedience to your mother\u2019s will.", " Myself distress\u2019d, an exile, and unknown, Debarr\u2019d from Europe, and from Asia thrown, In Libyan deserts wander thus alone.\u201d His tender parent could no longer bear; But, interposing, sought to soothe his care. \u201cWhoe\u2019er you are, not unbelov\u2019d by Heav\u2019n, Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv\u2019n: Have courage: to the gods permit the rest, And to the queen expose your just request. Now take this earnest of success, for more: Your scatter\u2019d fleet is join\u2019d upon the shore; The winds are chang\u2019d, your friends from danger free; Or I renounce my skill in augury. Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move, And stoop with closing pinions from above; Whom late the bird of Jove had driv\u2019n along, And thro\u2019 the clouds pursued the scatt\u2019ring throng: Now, all united in a goodly team, They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream. As they, with joy returning, clap their wings, And ride the circuit of the skies in rings; Not otherwise your ships, and ev\u2019ry friend, Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend. No more advice is needful; but pursue The path before you, and the town in view.\u201d Thus having said, she turn\u2019d, and made appear Her neck refulgent, and dishevel\u2019d hair, Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach\u2019d the ground. And widely spread ambrosial scents around: In length of train descends her sweeping gown; And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known. The prince pursued the parting deity With words like these: \u201cAh!"], "What happens to Aeneas and his men as they sail near Sicily?": [" Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain A death so ling\u2019ring, and so full of pain, Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife Of lab\u2019ring nature, and dissolve her life. For since she died, not doom\u2019d by Heav\u2019n\u2019s decree, Or her own crime, but human casualty, And rage of love, that plung\u2019d her in despair, The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair, Which Proserpine and they can only know; Nor made her sacred to the shades below. Downward the various goddess took her flight, And drew a thousand colours from the light; Then stood above the dying lover\u2019s head, And said: \u201cI thus devote thee to the dead. This off\u2019ring to th\u2019 infernal gods I bear.\u201d Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: The struggling soul was loos\u2019d, and life dissolv\u2019d in air. BOOK V THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage. He applies himself to celebrate the memory of his father with divine honours, and accordingly institues funeral games, and appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the ceremonies are performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan woman to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them: which burned four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous shower extinguished it.", " Like them, a lonely life I might have led, Not mourn\u2019d the living, nor disturb\u2019d the dead.\u201d These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast. On board, the Trojan found more easy rest. Resolv\u2019d to sail, in sleep he pass\u2019d the night; And order\u2019d all things for his early flight. To whom once more the winged god appears; His former youthful mien and shape he wears, And with this new alarm invades his ears: \u201cSleep\u2019st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town, Beset with foes; nor hear\u2019st the western gales Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails? She harbours in her heart a furious hate, And thou shalt find the dire effects too late; Fix\u2019d on revenge, and obstinate to die. Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow\u2019r to fly. The sea with ships will soon be cover\u2019d o\u2019er, And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore. Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies, And sail before the purple morn arise. Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring? Woman\u2019s a various and a changeful thing.\u201d Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight Aloft in air unseen, and mix\u2019d with night. Twice warn\u2019d by the celestial messenger, The pious prince arose with hasty fear; Then rous\u2019d his drowsy train without delay: \u201cHaste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh, And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea. A god commands: he stood before my sight, And urg\u2019d us once again to speedy flight.", " I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.\u201d BOOK III THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet with which he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace. From thence he directs his course to Delos and asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation. By a mistake of the oracle\u2019s answer, he settles in Crete. His household gods give him the true sense of the oracle in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy. He is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies. This is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him upon the Carthaginian coast. When Heav\u2019n had overturn\u2019d the Trojan state And Priam\u2019s throne, by too severe a fate; When ruin\u2019d Troy became the Grecians\u2019 prey, And Ilium\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs in ashes lay; Warn\u2019d by celestial omens, we retreat, To seek in foreign lands a happier seat. Near old Antandros, and at Ida\u2019s foot, The timber of the sacred groves we cut, And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find What place the gods for our repose assign\u2019d. Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, When old Anchises summon\u2019d all to sea: The crew my father and the Fates obey. With sighs and tears I leave my native shore, And empty fields, where Ilium stood before.", " Of various things discoursing as he pass\u2019d, Anchises hither bends his steps at last. Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn\u2019d to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII THE ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call\u2019d from thee, The nurse of great Aeneas\u2019 infancy. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia\u2019s plains; Thy name (\u2019tis all a ghost can have) remains. Now, when the prince her fun\u2019ral rites had paid, He plow\u2019d the Tyrrhene seas with sails display\u2019d. From land a gentle breeze arose by night, Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, And the sea trembled with her silver light. Now near the shelves of Circe\u2019s shores they run, (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) A dang\u2019rous coast: the goddess wastes her days In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, And cedar brands supply her father\u2019s light."], "What does Jupiter promise Venus when she expresses concern about Aeneas?": [" BOOK X THE ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\u201d Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large: \u201cO pow\u2019r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else protection can we fly?)", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AENEID *** Produced by Anonymous Volunteers and David Widger THE AENEID by Virgil Translated by John Dryden Contents BOOK I BOOK II BOOK III BOOK IV BOOK V BOOK VI BOOK VII BOOK VIII BOOK IX BOOK X BOOK XI BOOK XII BOOK I THE ARGUMENT. The Trojans, after a seven years\u2019 voyage, set sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Aeolus raises at the request of Juno. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune drives off the winds, and calms the sea. Aeneas, with his own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her son\u2019s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians. Aeneas, going out to discover the country, meets his mother in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by device of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some discourse with him, desires the history of his adventures since the siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following books. Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc\u2019d by fate, And haughty Juno\u2019s unrelenting hate, Expell\u2019d and exil\u2019d, left the Trojan shore. Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore, And in the doubtful war, before he won The Latian realm, and built the destin\u2019d town; His banish\u2019d gods restor\u2019d to rites divine, And settled sure succession in his line, From whence the race of Alban fathers come, And the long glories of majestic Rome.", " Accept whate\u2019er Aeneas can afford; Untouch\u2019d thy arms, untaken be thy sword; And all that pleas\u2019d thee living, still remain Inviolate, and sacred to the slain. Thy body on thy parents I bestow, To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know, Or have a sense of human things below. There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell: \u2018\u2019Twas by the great Aeneas hand I fell.\u2019\u201d With this, his distant friends he beckons near, Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear: Himself assists to lift him from the ground, With clotted locks, and blood that well\u2019d from out the wound. Meantime, his father, now no father, stood, And wash\u2019d his wounds by Tiber\u2019s yellow flood: Oppress\u2019d with anguish, panting, and o\u2019erspent, His fainting limbs against an oak he leant. A bough his brazen helmet did sustain; His heavier arms lay scatter\u2019d on the plain: A chosen train of youth around him stand; His drooping head was rested on his hand: His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought; And all on Lausus ran his restless thought. Careful, concern\u2019d his danger to prevent, He much enquir\u2019d, and many a message sent To warn him from the field\u2014alas! in vain! Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain! O\u2019er his broad shield still gush\u2019d the yawning wound, And drew a bloody trail along the ground. Far off he heard their cries, far off divin\u2019d The dire event, with a foreboding mind. With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head; Then both his lifted hands to heav\u2019n he spread; Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said: \u201cWhat joys, alas!", " Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance; By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance: Victors and vanquish\u2019d, in the various field, Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield. The gods from heav\u2019n survey the fatal strife, And mourn the miseries of human life. Above the rest, two goddesses appear Concern\u2019d for each: here Venus, Juno there. Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes. Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain, Brandish\u2019d his spear, and rush\u2019d into the plain, Where tow\u2019ring in the midmost rank she stood, Like tall Orion stalking o\u2019er the flood. (When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves, His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves), Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread, Deep fix\u2019d in earth; in clouds he hides his head. The Trojan prince beheld him from afar, And dauntless undertook the doubtful war. Collected in his strength, and like a rock, Pois\u2019d on his base, Mezentius stood the shock. He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries: \u201cMy strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke! (Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.) His armour, from the Trojan pirate torn, By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn.\u201d He said; and with his utmost force he threw The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew, Reach\u2019d the celestial shield, that stopp\u2019d the course; But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt The side and bowels fam\u2019d Anthores fix\u2019d."], "Where does Venus tell Aeneas to go?": [" Aeneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years\u2019 siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he met with in defence of it. At last, having been before advised by Hector\u2019s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him. All were attentive to the godlike man, When from his lofty couch he thus began: \u201cGreat queen, what you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: An empire from its old foundations rent, And ev\u2019ry woe the Trojans underwent; A peopled city made a desert place; All that I saw, and part of which I was: Not ev\u2019n the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. And now the latter watch of wasting night, And setting stars, to kindly rest invite; But, since you take such int\u2019rest in our woe, And Troy\u2019s disastrous end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell.", " Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize, Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories? The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought, The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought. Go now, deluded man, and seek again New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain. Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize; Protect the Latians in luxurious ease. This dream all-pow\u2019rful Juno sends; I bear Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear. Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain; With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train: Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie In Tiber\u2019s mouth, with fire and sword destroy. The Latian king, unless he shall submit, Own his old promise, and his new forget; Let him, in arms, the pow\u2019r of Turnus prove, And learn to fear whom he disdains to love. For such is Heav\u2019n\u2019s command.\u201d The youthful prince With scorn replied, and made this bold defence: \u201cYou tell me, mother, what I knew before: The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore. I neither fear nor will provoke the war; My fate is Juno\u2019s most peculiar care. But time has made you dote, and vainly tell Of arms imagin\u2019d in your lonely cell. Go; be the temple and the gods your care; Permit to men the thought of peace and war.\u201d These haughty words Alecto\u2019s rage provoke, And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke. Her eyes grow stiffen\u2019d, and with sulphur burn; Her hideous looks and hellish form return; Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place, And open all the furies of her face: Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes, She cast him backward as he strove to rise, And, ling\u2019ring, sought to frame some new replies.", " Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, Whose mighty trunk had better grac\u2019d the wood, If Pallas had arriv\u2019d, with equal length Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd\u2019st in vain? Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, And, after Pallas\u2019 death, live ling\u2019ring on, \u2019Tis to behold his vengeance for my son. I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead. My son and I expect it from his hand; \u2019Tis all that he can give, or we demand. Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, To greet my Pallas with such news below.\u201d The morn had now dispell\u2019d the shades of night, Restoring toils, when she restor\u2019d the light. The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command To raise the piles along the winding strand. Their friends convey the dead fun\u2019ral fires; Black smould\u2019ring smoke from the green wood expires; The light of heav\u2019n is chok\u2019d, and the new day retires. Then thrice around the kindled piles they go (For ancient custom had ordain\u2019d it so) Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw The spoils, in battle taken from the foe: Helms, bits emboss\u2019d, and swords of shining steel; One casts a target, one a chariot wheel; Some to their fellows their own arms restore: The falchions which in luckless fight they bore, Their bucklers pierc\u2019d, their darts bestow\u2019d in vain, And shiver\u2019d lances gather\u2019d from the plain.", " Ev\u2019n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain: The body, not the mind; nor can control Th\u2019 immortal vigour, or abate the soul. Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray: We live by plunder, and delight in prey. Your vests embroider\u2019d with rich purple shine; In sloth you glory, and in dances join. Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride Your turbans underneath your chins are tied. Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again! Go, less than women, in the shapes of men! Go, mix\u2019d with eunuchs, in the Mother\u2019s rites, Where with unequal sound the flute invites; Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida\u2019s shade: Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!\u201d This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear With patience, or a vow\u2019d revenge forbear. At the full stretch of both his hands he drew, And almost join\u2019d the horns of the tough yew. But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood, And thus with lifted hands invok\u2019d the god: \u201cMy first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed! An annual off\u2019ring in thy grove shall bleed; A snow-white steer, before thy altar led, Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head, Butts with his threat\u2019ning brows, and bellowing stands, And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands.\u201d Jove bow\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, and lent a gracious ear, And thunder\u2019d on the left, amidst the clear. Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies The feather\u2019d death, and hisses thro\u2019 the skies."], "What happens to Dido once Aeneas arrives?": [" The town of Camarine from far we see, And fenny lake, undrain\u2019d by fate\u2019s decree. In sight of the Geloan fields we pass, And the large walls, where mighty Gela was; Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown\u2019d, Long for the race of warlike steeds renown\u2019d. We pass\u2019d Selinus, and the palmy land, And widely shun the Lilybaean strand, Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. At length on shore the weary fleet arriv\u2019d, Which Drepanum\u2019s unhappy port receiv\u2019d.

BOOK IV THE ARGUMENT. Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus\u2019 consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Aeneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AENEID *** Produced by Anonymous Volunteers and David Widger THE AENEID by Virgil Translated by John Dryden Contents BOOK I BOOK II BOOK III BOOK IV BOOK V BOOK VI BOOK VII BOOK VIII BOOK IX BOOK X BOOK XI BOOK XII BOOK I THE ARGUMENT. The Trojans, after a seven years\u2019 voyage, set sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Aeolus raises at the request of Juno. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune drives off the winds, and calms the sea. Aeneas, with his own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her son\u2019s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians. Aeneas, going out to discover the country, meets his mother in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by device of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some discourse with him, desires the history of his adventures since the siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following books. Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc\u2019d by fate, And haughty Juno\u2019s unrelenting hate, Expell\u2019d and exil\u2019d, left the Trojan shore. Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore, And in the doubtful war, before he won The Latian realm, and built the destin\u2019d town; His banish\u2019d gods restor\u2019d to rites divine, And settled sure succession in his line, From whence the race of Alban fathers come, And the long glories of majestic Rome.", " Two gods a silly woman have undone! Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect This rising city, which my hands erect: But shall celestial discord never cease? \u2019Tis better ended in a lasting peace. You stand possess\u2019d of all your soul desir\u2019d: Poor Dido with consuming love is fir\u2019d. Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join; So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine: One common kingdom, one united line. Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey, And lofty Carthage for a dow\u2019r convey.\u201d Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried, Which would the scepter of the world misguide To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied: \u201cWho, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, And such alliance and such gifts refuse, If Fortune with our joint desires comply? The doubt is all from Jove and destiny; Lest he forbid, with absolute command, To mix the people in one common land.

There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around, And cheerful horns from side to side resound, A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain; The fearful train shall take their speedy flight, Dispers\u2019d, and all involv\u2019d in gloomy night; One cave a grateful shelter shall afford To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.", " As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends, Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends, Prepar\u2019d for fight; the fatal dart arrives, And thro\u2019 the borders of his buckler drives; Pass\u2019d thro\u2019 and pierc\u2019d his groin: the deadly wound, Cast from his chariot, roll\u2019d him on the ground. Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite: \u201cBlame not the slowness of your steeds in flight; Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat; But you yourself forsake your empty seat.\u201d He said, and seiz\u2019d at once the loosen\u2019d rein; For Liger lay already on the plain, By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands, The recreant thus his wretched life demands: \u201cNow, by thyself, O more than mortal man! By her and him from whom thy breath began, Who form\u2019d thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant\u2019s pray\u2019r.\u201d Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said; But the stern hero turn\u2019d aside his head, And cut him short: \u201cI hear another man; You talk\u2019d not thus before the fight began. Now take your turn; and, as a brother should, Attend your brother to the Stygian flood.\u201d Then thro\u2019 his breast his fatal sword he sent, And the soul issued at the gaping vent. As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground, Thus rag\u2019d the prince, and scatter\u2019d deaths around. At length Ascanius and the Trojan train Broke from the camp, so long besieg\u2019d in vain. Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man Held conference with his queen, and thus began: \u201cMy sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife, Still think you Venus\u2019 aid supports the strife\u2014 Sustains her Trojans\u2014or themselves, alone, With inborn valour force their fortune on?"], "What story does Aeneas begin telling Dido?": [" Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are: A people rude in peace, and rough in war. The rising city, which from far you see, Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. Phoenician Dido rules the growing state, Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother\u2019s hate. Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, Possess\u2019d fair Dido\u2019s bed; and either heart At once was wounded with an equal dart. Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway\u2019d: One who condemn\u2019d divine and human laws. Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, With steel invades his brother\u2019s life by stealth; Before the sacred altar made him bleed, And long from her conceal\u2019d the cruel deed. Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin\u2019d, To soothe his sister, and delude her mind. At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares, And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. The cruel altars and his fate he tells, And the dire secret of his house reveals, Then warns the widow, with her household gods, To seek a refuge in remote abodes. Last, to support her in so long a way, He shows her where his hidden treasure lay. Admonish\u2019d thus, and seiz\u2019d with mortal fright, The queen provides companions of her flight: They meet, and all combine to leave the state, Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.", " So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind, Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind, Distracted with her pain she flies the woods, Bounds o\u2019er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods, With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart. And now she leads the Trojan chief along The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng; Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town, Which love, without his labour, makes his own. This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand\u2019ring guest; Her falt\u2019ring tongue forbids to speak the rest. When day declines, and feasts renew the night, Still on his face she feeds her famish\u2019d sight; She longs again to hear the prince relate His own adventures and the Trojan fate. He tells it o\u2019er and o\u2019er; but still in vain, For still she begs to hear it once again. The hearer on the speaker\u2019s mouth depends, And thus the tragic story never ends. Then, when they part, when Phoebe\u2019s paler light Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite, She last remains, when ev\u2019ry guest is gone, Sits on the bed he press\u2019d, and sighs alone; Absent, her absent hero sees and hears; Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears, And seeks the father\u2019s image in the child, If love by likeness might be so beguil\u2019d. Meantime the rising tow\u2019rs are at a stand; No labours exercise the youthful band, Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know; The mole is left unfinish\u2019d to the foe; The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie, Short of their promis\u2019d heighth, that seem\u2019d to threat the sky, But when imperial Juno, from above, Saw Dido fetter\u2019d in the chains of love, Hot with the venom which her veins inflam\u2019d, And by no sense of shame to be reclaim\u2019d, With soothing words to Venus she begun: \u201cHigh praises, endless honours, you have won, And mighty trophies, with your worthy son!", " The town of Camarine from far we see, And fenny lake, undrain\u2019d by fate\u2019s decree.

Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight. This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath, This chosen arrow, to revenge her death: By whate\u2019er hand Camilla shall be slain, Or of the Trojan or Italian train, Let him not pass unpunish\u2019d from the plain.

The faithful nymph descends from high With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky: Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly. By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse, Drawn up in squadrons, with united force, Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound, Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground. Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far; And the fields glitter with a waving war. Oppos\u2019d to these, come on with furious force Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse; These in the body plac\u2019d, on either hand Sustain\u2019d and clos\u2019d by fair Camilla\u2019s band. Advancing in a line, they couch their spears; And less and less the middle space appears. Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen The neighing coursers, and the shouting men. In distance of their darts they stop their course; Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.", " One summer\u2019s night and one whole day they pass Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass. The fiery sun had finish\u2019d half his race, Look\u2019d back, and doubted in the middle space, When they from far beheld the rising tow\u2019rs, The tops of sheds, and shepherds\u2019 lowly bow\u2019rs, Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay, Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway. These cots (Evander\u2019s kingdom, mean and poor) The Trojan saw, and turn\u2019d his ships to shore. \u2019Twas on a solemn day: th\u2019 Arcadian states, The king and prince, without the city gates, Then paid their off\u2019rings in a sacred grove To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove. Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies, And fat of entrails on his altar fries. But, when they saw the ships that stemm\u2019d the flood, And glitter\u2019d thro\u2019 the covert of the wood, They rose with fear, and left th\u2019 unfinish\u2019d feast, Till dauntless Pallas reassur\u2019d the rest To pay the rites. Himself without delay A jav\u2019lin seiz\u2019d, and singly took his way; Then gain\u2019d a rising ground, and call\u2019d from far: \u201cResolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are; Your bus\u2019ness here; and bring you peace or war?\u201d High on the stern Aeneas took his stand, And held a branch of olive in his hand, While thus he spoke: \u201cThe Phrygians\u2019 arms you see, Expell\u2019d from Troy, provok\u2019d in Italy By Latian foes, with war unjustly made; At first affianc\u2019d, and at last betray\u2019d. This message bear: \u2018The Trojans and their chief Bring holy peace, and beg the king\u2019s relief.\u2019 Struck with so great a name, and all on fire, The youth replies: \u201cWhatever you require, Your fame exacts.", " The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide, With noise say nothing, and in parts divide. Laocoon, follow\u2019d by a num\u2019rous crowd, Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud: \u2018O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns? What more than madness has possess\u2019d your brains? Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone? And are Ulysses\u2019 arts no better known? This hollow fabric either must inclose, Within its blind recess, our secret foes; Or \u2019tis an engine rais\u2019d above the town, T\u2019 o\u2019erlook the walls, and then to batter down. Somewhat is sure design\u2019d, by fraud or force: Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.\u2019 Thus having said, against the steed he threw His forceful spear, which, hissing as it flew, Pierc\u2019d thro\u2019 the yielding planks of jointed wood, And trembling in the hollow belly stood. The sides, transpierc\u2019d, return a rattling sound, And groans of Greeks inclos\u2019d come issuing thro\u2019 the wound And, had not Heav\u2019n the fall of Troy design\u2019d, Or had not men been fated to be blind, Enough was said and done t\u2019inspire a better mind. Then had our lances pierc\u2019d the treach\u2019rous wood, And Ilian tow\u2019rs and Priam\u2019s empire stood. Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring A captive Greek, in bands, before the king; Taken to take; who made himself their prey, T\u2019 impose on their belief, and Troy betray; Fix\u2019d on his aim, and obstinately bent To die undaunted, or to circumvent. About the captive, tides of Trojans flow; All press to see, and some insult the foe.", " Aeneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years\u2019 siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he met with in defence of it. At last, having been before advised by Hector\u2019s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him. All were attentive to the godlike man, When from his lofty couch he thus began: \u201cGreat queen, what you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: An empire from its old foundations rent, And ev\u2019ry woe the Trojans underwent; A peopled city made a desert place; All that I saw, and part of which I was: Not ev\u2019n the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. And now the latter watch of wasting night, And setting stars, to kindly rest invite; But, since you take such int\u2019rest in our woe, And Troy\u2019s disastrous end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell."], "Who stops Aeneas from killing Helen?": [" BOOK X THE ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\u201d Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large: \u201cO pow\u2019r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else protection can we fly?)", " Disdain and conscious virtue fir\u2019d his breast, And with redoubled force his foe he press\u2019d. He lays on load with either hand, amain, And headlong drives the Trojan o\u2019er the plain; Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows; But storms of strokes descend about his brows, A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows. But now the prince, who saw the wild increase Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease, And bounds Entellus\u2019 wrath, and bids the peace. First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came, And sooth\u2019d his sorrow for the suffer\u2019d shame. \u201cWhat fury seiz\u2019d my friend? The gods,\u201d said he, \u201cTo him propitious, and averse to thee, Have giv\u2019n his arm superior force to thine. \u2019Tis madness to contend with strength divine.\u201d The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore: His mouth and nostrils pour\u2019d a purple flood, And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood. Faintly he stagger\u2019d thro\u2019 the hissing throng, And hung his head, and trail\u2019d his legs along. The sword and casque are carried by his train; But with his foe the palm and ox remain. The champion, then, before Aeneas came, Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame: \u201cO goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host, Mark with attention, and forgive my boast; Learn what I was, by what remains; and know From what impending fate you sav\u2019d my foe.\u201d Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull; And, on his ample forehead aiming full, The deadly stroke, descending, pierc\u2019d the skull.", " At least my shade thy punishment shall know, And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.\u201d Abruptly here she stops; then turns away Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day. Amaz\u2019d he stood, revolving in his mind What speech to frame, and what excuse to find. Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led, And softly laid her on her ivory bed. But good Aeneas, tho\u2019 he much desir\u2019d To give that pity which her grief requir\u2019d; Tho\u2019 much he mourn\u2019d, and labour\u2019d with his love, Resolv\u2019d at length, obeys the will of Jove; Reviews his forces: they with early care Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare. The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride, And well-calk\u2019d galleys in the harbour ride. Then oaks for oars they fell\u2019d; or, as they stood, Of its green arms despoil\u2019d the growing wood, Studious of flight. The beach is cover\u2019d o\u2019er With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore: On ev\u2019ry side are seen, descending down, Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town. Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants, Fearful of winter, and of future wants, T\u2019 invade the corn, and to their cells convey The plunder\u2019d forage of their yellow prey. The sable troops, along the narrow tracks, Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs: Some set their shoulders to the pond\u2019rous grain; Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train; All ply their sev\u2019ral tasks, and equal toil sustain. What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore, When, from the tow\u2019r, she saw the cover\u2019d shore, And heard the shouts of sailors from afar, Mix\u2019d with the murmurs of the wat\u2019ry war!", " What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace? \u2019Twas fam\u2019d, that in our last and fatal night Your single prowess long sustain\u2019d the fight, Till tir\u2019d, not forc\u2019d, a glorious fate you chose, And fell upon a heap of slaughter\u2019d foes. But, in remembrance of so brave a deed, A tomb and fun\u2019ral honours I decreed; Thrice call\u2019d your manes on the Trojan plains: The place your armour and your name retains. Your body too I sought, and, had I found, Design\u2019d for burial in your native ground.\u201d The ghost replied: \u201cYour piety has paid All needful rites, to rest my wand\u2019ring shade; But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife, To Grecian swords betray\u2019d my sleeping life. These are the monuments of Helen\u2019s love: The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above. You know in what deluding joys we pass\u2019d The night that was by Heav\u2019n decreed our last: For, when the fatal horse, descending down, Pregnant with arms, o\u2019erwhelm\u2019d th\u2019 unhappy town She feign\u2019d nocturnal orgies; left my bed, And, mix\u2019d with Trojan dames, the dances led Then, waving high her torch, the signal made, Which rous\u2019d the Grecians from their ambuscade. With watching overworn, with cares oppress\u2019d, Unhappy I had laid me down to rest, And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess\u2019d. Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid, And from beneath my head my sword convey\u2019d; The door unlatch\u2019d, and, with repeated calls, Invites her former lord within my walls."], "What persuades Aeneas's father to leave Troy?": [" Thus Priam fell, and shar\u2019d one common fate With Troy in ashes, and his ruin\u2019d state: He, who the scepter of all Asia sway\u2019d, Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey\u2019d. On the bleak shore now lies th\u2019 abandon\u2019d king, A headless carcass, and a nameless thing. \u201cThen, not before, I felt my curdled blood Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood: My father\u2019s image fill\u2019d my pious mind, Lest equal years might equal fortune find. Again I thought on my forsaken wife, And trembled for my son\u2019s abandon\u2019d life. I look\u2019d about, but found myself alone, Deserted at my need! My friends were gone. Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress\u2019d, Leap\u2019d headlong from the heights; the flames consum\u2019d the rest. Thus, wand\u2019ring in my way, without a guide, The graceless Helen in the porch I spied Of Vesta\u2019s temple; there she lurk\u2019d alone; Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: But, by the flames that cast their blaze around, That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.

The foes already have possess\u2019d the wall; Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall. Enough is paid to Priam\u2019s royal name, More than enough to duty and to fame.

Now Troy to thee commends her future state, And gives her gods companions of thy fate: From their assistance walls expect, Which, wand\u2019ring long, at last thou shalt erect.\u2019 He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes, The venerable statues of the gods, With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir, The wreaths and relics of th\u2019 immortal fire."], "What does Aeneas find when he goes back to Troy to look for his wife?": [" Thus Priam fell, and shar\u2019d one common fate With Troy in ashes, and his ruin\u2019d state: He, who the scepter of all Asia sway\u2019d, Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey\u2019d.

In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came, And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim. The spear flew hissing thro\u2019 the middle space, And pierc\u2019d his throat, directed at his face; It stopp\u2019d at once the passage of his wind, And the free soul to flitting air resign\u2019d: His forehead was the first that struck the ground; Lifeblood and life rush\u2019d mingled thro\u2019 the wound. He slew three brothers of the Borean race, And three, whom Ismarus, their native place, Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace. Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads: The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds, Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand, These fight to keep, and those to win, the land. With mutual blood th\u2019 Ausonian soil is dyed, While on its borders each their claim decide. As wintry winds, contending in the sky, With equal force of lungs their titles try: They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav\u2019n Stands without motion, and the tide undriv\u2019n: Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield, They long suspend the fortune of the field.", " Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood; But first collected in his arms he stood: Advancing then, he plied the spear so well, Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell. Around his head he toss\u2019d his glitt\u2019ring brand, And from Strymonius hew\u2019d his better hand, Held up to guard his throat; then hurl\u2019d a stone At Thoas\u2019 ample front, and pierc\u2019d the bone: It struck beneath the space of either eye; And blood, and mingled brains, together fly. Deep skill\u2019d in future fates, Halesus\u2019 sire Did with the youth to lonely groves retire: But, when the father\u2019s mortal race was run, Dire destiny laid hold upon the son, And haul\u2019d him to the war, to find, beneath Th\u2019 Evandrian spear, a memorable death.

But Lausus, no small portion of the war, Permits not panic fear to reign too far, Caus\u2019d by the death of so renown\u2019d a knight; But by his own example cheers the fight.

With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike; And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike. Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field; And hearts are pierc\u2019d, unknowing how to yield: They blow for blow return, and wound for wound; And heaps of bodies raise the level ground. Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs From a long royal race of Latian kings, Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown, Crush\u2019d with the weight of an unwieldy stone: Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore His living load, his dying body tore. His starting steeds, to shun the glitt\u2019ring sword, Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord. Fierce Hyllus threaten\u2019d high, and, face to face, Affronted Turnus in the middle space: The prince encounter\u2019d him in full career, And at his temples aim\u2019d the deadly spear; So fatally the flying weapon sped, That thro\u2019 his brazen helm it pierc\u2019d his head. Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus\u2019 hand, In vain the strongest of th\u2019 Arcadian band: Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford Availing aid against th\u2019 Aenean sword, Which to his naked heart pursued the course; Nor could his plated shield sustain the force."], "Which god speaks to Aeneas on Delos?": [" Twelve days the term allow\u2019d: and, during those, Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes, Mix\u2019d in the woods, for fun\u2019ral piles prepare To fell the timber, and forget the war.

Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, And their mix\u2019d mourning rends the vaulted sky. The town is fill\u2019d with tumult and with tears, Till the loud clamours reach Evander\u2019s ears: Forgetful of his state, he runs along, With a disorder\u2019d pace, and cleaves the throng; Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies, With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.

You loiter, while the spoils are borne away: Our ships are laden with the Trojan store; And you, like truants, come too late ashore.\u2019 He said, but soon corrected his mistake, Found, by the doubtful answers which we make: Amaz\u2019d, he would have shunn\u2019d th\u2019 unequal fight; But we, more num\u2019rous, intercept his flight. As when some peasant, in a bushy brake, Has with unwary footing press\u2019d a snake; He starts aside, astonish\u2019d, when he spies His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes; So from our arms surpris\u2019d Androgeos flies. In vain; for him and his we compass\u2019d round, Possess\u2019d with fear, unknowing of the ground, And of their lives an easy conquest found. Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil\u2019d. Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil\u2019d, Swoln with success, and a daring mind, This new invention fatally design\u2019d. \u2018My friends,\u2019 said he, \u2018since Fortune shows the way, \u2019Tis fit we should th\u2019 auspicious guide obey. For what has she these Grecian arms bestow\u2019d, But their destruction, and the Trojans\u2019 good? Then change we shields, and their devices bear: Let fraud supply the want of force in war. They find us arms.\u2019 This said, himself he dress\u2019d In dead Androgeos\u2019 spoils, his upper vest, His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.", " The steel thro\u2019 both his temples forc\u2019d the way: Extended on the ground, Numanus lay. \u201cGo now, vain boaster, and true valour scorn! The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.\u201d Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake The heav\u2019ns with shouting, and new vigour take. Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud: \u201cAdvance, illustrious youth, increase in fame, And wide from east to west extend thy name; Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe To thee a race of demigods below. This is the way to heav\u2019n: the pow\u2019rs divine From this beginning date the Julian line. To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, The conquer\u2019d war is due, and the vast world is theirs. Troy is too narrow for thy name.\u201d He said, And plunging downward shot his radiant head; Dispell\u2019d the breathing air, that broke his flight: Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. Old Butes\u2019 form he took, Anchises\u2019 squire, Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: \u201cSuffice it thee, thy father\u2019s worthy son, The warlike prize thou hast already won. The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. Now tempt the war no more.\u201d He said, and flew Obscure in air, and vanish\u2019d from their view."], "What prophecy does the harpy make to Aeneas and his men?": [" Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien, Was first, and favour\u2019d by the Latian queen; With him she strove to join Lavinia\u2019s hand, But dire portents the purpos\u2019d match withstand. Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood A laurel\u2019s trunk, a venerable wood; Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair Was kept and cut with superstitious care. This plant Latinus, when his town he wall\u2019d, Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call\u2019d; And last, in honour of his new abode, He vow\u2019d the laurel to the laurel\u2019s god. It happen\u2019d once (a boding prodigy!) A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky, Unknown from whence they took their airy flight, Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight; There with their clasping feet together clung, And a long cluster from the laurel hung. An ancient augur prophesied from hence: \u201cBehold on Latian shores a foreign prince! From the same parts of heav\u2019n his navy stands, To the same parts on earth; his army lands; The town he conquers, and the tow\u2019r commands.\u201d Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire Before the gods, and stood beside her sire, Strange to relate, the flames, involv\u2019d in smoke Of incense, from the sacred altar broke, Caught her dishevel\u2019d hair and rich attire; Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire: From thence the fuming trail began to spread And lambent glories danc\u2019d about her head. This new portent the seer with wonder views, Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews: \u201cThe nymph, who scatters flaming fires around, Shall shine with honour, shall herself be crown\u2019d; But, caus\u2019d by her irrevocable fate, War shall the country waste, and change the state.\u201d Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent, For counsel to his father Faunus went, And sought the shades renown\u2019d for prophecy Which near Albunea\u2019s sulph\u2019rous fountain lie.", " Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound, He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies, And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies. Their tasks perform\u2019d, the serpents quit their prey, And to the tow\u2019r of Pallas make their way: Couch\u2019d at her feet, they lie protected there By her large buckler and protended spear. Amazement seizes all; the gen\u2019ral cry Proclaims Laocoon justly doom\u2019d to die, Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood, And dared to violate the sacred wood. All vote t\u2019 admit the steed, that vows be paid And incense offer\u2019d to th\u2019 offended maid. A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare; Some hoisting levers, some the wheels prepare And fasten to the horse\u2019s feet; the rest With cables haul along th\u2019 unwieldly beast. Each on his fellow for assistance calls; At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls, Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown\u2019d, And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around. Thus rais\u2019d aloft, and then descending down, It enters o\u2019er our heads, and threats the town. O sacred city, built by hands divine! O valiant heroes of the Trojan line! Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound. Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate, We haul along the horse in solemn state; Then place the dire portent within the tow\u2019r. Cassandra cried, and curs\u2019d th\u2019 unhappy hour; Foretold our fate; but, by the god\u2019s decree, All heard, and none believ\u2019d the prophecy.", " The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force. Then Venulus to Diomede they send, To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, Declare the common danger, and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm: \u201cAeneas, landed on the Latian coast, With banish\u2019d gods, and with a baffled host, Yet now aspir\u2019d to conquest of the state, And claim\u2019d a title from the gods and fate; What num\u2019rous nations in his quarrel came, And how they spread his formidable name. What he design\u2019d, what mischief might arise, If fortune favour\u2019d his first enterprise, Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, And common interest, was involv\u2019d in theirs.\u201d While Turnus and th\u2019 allies thus urge the war, The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.", " Hopeless to win by war, to pray\u2019rs we fall, And on th\u2019 offended Harpies humbly call, And whether gods or birds obscene they were, Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer. But old Anchises, off\u2019ring sacrifice, And lifting up to heav\u2019n his hands and eyes, Ador\u2019d the greater gods: \u2018Avert,\u2019 said he, \u2018These omens; render vain this prophecy, And from th\u2019 impending curse a pious people free!\u2019 \u201cThus having said, he bids us put to sea; We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey, And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat\u2019ry way. Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear; And next by rocky Neritos we steer: We fly from Ithaca\u2019s detested shore, And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore. At length Leucate\u2019s cloudy top appears, And the Sun\u2019s temple, which the sailor fears. Resolv\u2019d to breathe a while from labour past, Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast, And joyful to the little city haste. Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay To Jove, the guide and patron of our way. The customs of our country we pursue, And Trojan games on Actian shores renew. Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil, And exercise the wrastlers\u2019 noble toil; Pleas\u2019d to have sail\u2019d so long before the wind, And left so many Grecian towns behind. The sun had now fulfill\u2019d his annual course, And Boreas on the seas display\u2019d his force: I fix\u2019d upon the temple\u2019s lofty door The brazen shield which vanquish\u2019d Abas bore; The verse beneath my name and action speaks: \u2018These arms Aeneas took from conqu\u2019ring Greeks.\u2019 Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly."], "What creatures do Aeneas and his men encounter on Sicily?": [" The guard reliev\u2019d, the gen\u2019rous couple went To find the council at the royal tent. All creatures else forgot their daily care, And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate In nightly council for th\u2019 indanger\u2019d state. They vote a message to their absent chief, Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief. Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, Remote from clamour, and secure from foes. On their left arms their ample shields they bear, The right reclin\u2019d upon the bending spear. Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, And beg admission, eager to be heard: Th\u2019 affair important, not to be deferr\u2019d. Ascanius bids \u2019em be conducted in, Ord\u2019ring the more experienc\u2019d to begin. Then Nisus thus: \u201cYe fathers, lend your ears; Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. The foe, securely drench\u2019d in sleep and wine, Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; And where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies, Cov\u2019ring the plain, and curling to the skies, Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, Close by the sea, a passage we have spied, Which will our way to great Aeneas guide. Expect each hour to see him safe again, Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. Snatch we the lucky minute while we may; Nor can we be mistaken in the way; For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen The rising turrets, and the stream between, And know the winding course, with ev\u2019ry ford.\u201d He ceas\u2019d; and old Alethes took the word: \u201cOur country gods, in whom our trust we place, Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race, While we behold such dauntless worth appear In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.\u201d Then into tears of joy the father broke; Each in his longing arms by turns he took; Panted and paus\u2019d; and thus again he spoke: \u201cYe brave young men, what equal gifts can we, In recompense of such desert, decree?", " As flames among the lofty woods are thrown On diff\u2019rent sides, and both by winds are blown; The laurels crackle in the sputt\u2019ring fire; The frighted sylvans from their shades retire: Or as two neighb\u2019ring torrents fall from high; Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry; They roll to sea with unresisted force, And down the rocks precipitate their course: Not with less rage the rival heroes take Their diff\u2019rent ways, nor less destruction make. With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike; And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike. Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field; And hearts are pierc\u2019d, unknowing how to yield: They blow for blow return, and wound for wound; And heaps of bodies raise the level ground. Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs From a long royal race of Latian kings, Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown, Crush\u2019d with the weight of an unwieldy stone: Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore His living load, his dying body tore. His starting steeds, to shun the glitt\u2019ring sword, Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord. Fierce Hyllus threaten\u2019d high, and, face to face, Affronted Turnus in the middle space: The prince encounter\u2019d him in full career, And at his temples aim\u2019d the deadly spear; So fatally the flying weapon sped, That thro\u2019 his brazen helm it pierc\u2019d his head. Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus\u2019 hand, In vain the strongest of th\u2019 Arcadian band: Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford Availing aid against th\u2019 Aenean sword, Which to his naked heart pursued the course; Nor could his plated shield sustain the force.", " Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain A death so ling\u2019ring, and so full of pain, Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife Of lab\u2019ring nature, and dissolve her life. For since she died, not doom\u2019d by Heav\u2019n\u2019s decree, Or her own crime, but human casualty, And rage of love, that plung\u2019d her in despair, The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair, Which Proserpine and they can only know; Nor made her sacred to the shades below. Downward the various goddess took her flight, And drew a thousand colours from the light; Then stood above the dying lover\u2019s head, And said: \u201cI thus devote thee to the dead. This off\u2019ring to th\u2019 infernal gods I bear.\u201d Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: The struggling soul was loos\u2019d, and life dissolv\u2019d in air. BOOK V THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage. He applies himself to celebrate the memory of his father with divine honours, and accordingly institues funeral games, and appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the ceremonies are performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan woman to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them: which burned four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous shower extinguished it.", " Forbid the fires our shipping to deface! Receive th\u2019 unhappy fugitives to grace, And spare the remnant of a pious race! We come not with design of wasteful prey, To drive the country, force the swains away: Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire; The vanquish\u2019d dare not to such thoughts aspire. A land there is, Hesperia nam\u2019d of old; The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold Th\u2019 Oenotrians held it once, by common fame Now call\u2019d Italia, from the leader\u2019s name. To that sweet region was our voyage bent, When winds and ev\u2019ry warring element Disturb\u2019d our course, and, far from sight of land, Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand: The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar, Dispers\u2019d and dash\u2019d the rest upon the rocky shore. Those few you see escap\u2019d the storm, and fear, Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here. What men, what monsters, what inhuman race, What laws, what barb\u2019rous customs of the place, Shut up a desert shore to drowning men, And drive us to the cruel seas again? If our hard fortune no compassion draws, Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws, The gods are just, and will revenge our cause. Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord, Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword; Observant of the right, religious of his word. If yet he lives, and draws this vital air, Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair; Nor you, great queen, these offices repent, Which he will equal, and perhaps augment."], "Why does Dido have mixed feelings about her love for Aeneas?": [" Two gods a silly woman have undone!

When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But anxious cares already seiz\u2019d the queen: She fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero\u2019s valour, acts, and birth inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, Improve the passion, and increase the smart. Now, when the purple morn had chas\u2019d away The dewy shadows, and restor\u2019d the day, Her sister first with early care she sought, And thus in mournful accents eas\u2019d her thought: \u201cMy dearest Anna, what new dreams affright My lab\u2019ring soul! what visions of the night Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast With strange ideas of our Trojan guest! His worth, his actions, and majestic air, A man descended from the gods declare. Fear ever argues a degenerate kind; His birth is well asserted by his mind. Then, what he suffer\u2019d, when by Fate betray\u2019d! What brave attempts for falling Troy he made! Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, That, were I not resolv\u2019d against the yoke Of hapless marriage, never to be curst With second love, so fatal was my first, To this one error I might yield again; For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain, This only man is able to subvert The fix\u2019d foundations of my stubborn heart.", " But, far above the rest, the royal dame, (Already doom\u2019d to love\u2019s disastrous flame,) With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy, Beholds the presents, and admires the boy. The guileful god about the hero long, With children\u2019s play, and false embraces, hung; Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms With greedy pleasure, and devour\u2019d his charms. Unhappy Dido little thought what guest, How dire a god, she drew so near her breast; But he, not mindless of his mother\u2019s pray\u2019r, Works in the pliant bosom of the fair, And moulds her heart anew, and blots her former care.

A milk-white heifer she with flow\u2019rs adorns, And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns; And, while the priests with pray\u2019r the gods invoke, She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke, With hourly care the sacrifice renews, And anxiously the panting entrails views. What priestly rites, alas! what pious art, What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart! A gentle fire she feeds within her veins, Where the soft god secure in silence reigns. Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves, From street to street the raving Dido roves.", " These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, And the rich present to the prince commends. Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, To their expecting lord with peace return. But jealous Juno, from Pachynus\u2019 height, As she from Argos took her airy flight, Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight. She saw the Trojan and his joyful train Descend upon the shore, desert the main, Design a town, and, with unhop\u2019d success, Th\u2019 embassadors return with promis\u2019d peace. Then, pierc\u2019d with pain, she shook her haughty head, Sigh\u2019d from her inward soul, and thus she said: \u201cO hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! O fates of Troy, which Juno\u2019s fates oppose! Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, But slain revive, and, taken, scape again? When execrable Troy in ashes lay, Thro\u2019 fires and swords and seas they forc\u2019d their way. Then vanquish\u2019d Juno must in vain contend, Her rage disarm\u2019d, her empire at an end. Breathless and tir\u2019d, is all my fury spent? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? As if \u2019twere little from their town to chase, I thro\u2019 the seas pursued their exil\u2019d race; Ingag\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, oppos\u2019d the stormy main; But billows roar\u2019d, and tempests rag\u2019d in vain. What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, When these they overpass, and those they shun? On Tiber\u2019s shores they land, secure of fate, Triumphant o\u2019er the storms and Juno\u2019s hate. Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia\u2019s wrath, Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon; What great offence had either people done?"], "What rumors begin to spread about Aeneas and Dido?": [" The town of Camarine from far we see, And fenny lake, undrain\u2019d by fate\u2019s decree. In sight of the Geloan fields we pass, And the large walls, where mighty Gela was; Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown\u2019d, Long for the race of warlike steeds renown\u2019d. We pass\u2019d Selinus, and the palmy land, And widely shun the Lilybaean strand, Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. At length on shore the weary fleet arriv\u2019d, Which Drepanum\u2019s unhappy port receiv\u2019d. Here, after endless labours, often toss\u2019d By raging storms, and driv\u2019n on ev\u2019ry coast, My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost: Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain, Sav\u2019d thro\u2019 a thousand toils, but sav\u2019d in vain The prophet, who my future woes reveal\u2019d, Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal\u2019d; And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill Denounc\u2019d all else, was silent of the ill.

BOOK IV THE ARGUMENT. Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus\u2019 consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Aeneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed.", " Two gods a silly woman have undone! Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect This rising city, which my hands erect: But shall celestial discord never cease? \u2019Tis better ended in a lasting peace. You stand possess\u2019d of all your soul desir\u2019d: Poor Dido with consuming love is fir\u2019d. Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join; So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine: One common kingdom, one united line. Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey, And lofty Carthage for a dow\u2019r convey.\u201d Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried, Which would the scepter of the world misguide To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied: \u201cWho, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, And such alliance and such gifts refuse, If Fortune with our joint desires comply? The doubt is all from Jove and destiny; Lest he forbid, with absolute command, To mix the people in one common land. Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line In lasting leagues and sure succession join? But you, the partner of his bed and throne, May move his mind; my wishes are your own.\u201d \u201cMine,\u201d said imperial Juno, \u201cbe the care; Time urges, now, to perfect this affair: Attend my counsel, and the secret share. When next the Sun his rising light displays, And gilds the world below with purple rays, The queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort. There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around, And cheerful horns from side to side resound, A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain; The fearful train shall take their speedy flight, Dispers\u2019d, and all involv\u2019d in gloomy night; One cave a grateful shelter shall afford To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.", " Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince New ramparts raising for the town\u2019s defence. A purple scarf, with gold embroider\u2019d o\u2019er, (Queen Dido\u2019s gift,) about his waist he wore; A sword, with glitt\u2019ring gems diversified, For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side. Then thus, with winged words, the god began, Resuming his own shape: \u201cDegenerate man, Thou woman\u2019s property, what mak\u2019st thou here, These foreign walls and Tyrian tow\u2019rs to rear, Forgetful of thy own? All-pow\u2019rful Jove, Who sways the world below and heav\u2019n above, Has sent me down with this severe command: What means thy ling\u2019ring in the Libyan land? If glory cannot move a mind so mean, Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean, Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir: The promis\u2019d crown let young Ascanius wear, To whom th\u2019 Ausonian scepter, and the state Of Rome\u2019s imperial name is ow\u2019d by fate.\u201d So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight, Involv\u2019d in clouds, and vanish\u2019d out of sight. The pious prince was seiz\u2019d with sudden fear; Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair. Revolving in his mind the stern command, He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land. What should he say? or how should he begin? What course, alas! remains to steer between Th\u2019 offended lover and the pow\u2019rful queen? This way and that he turns his anxious mind, And all expedients tries, and none can find. Fix\u2019d on the deed, but doubtful of the means, After long thought, to this advice he leans: Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair The fleet, and ship their men with silent care; Some plausible pretence he bids them find, To colour what in secret he design\u2019d.", " At least my shade thy punishment shall know, And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.\u201d Abruptly here she stops; then turns away Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day. Amaz\u2019d he stood, revolving in his mind What speech to frame, and what excuse to find. Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led, And softly laid her on her ivory bed. But good Aeneas, tho\u2019 he much desir\u2019d To give that pity which her grief requir\u2019d; Tho\u2019 much he mourn\u2019d, and labour\u2019d with his love, Resolv\u2019d at length, obeys the will of Jove; Reviews his forces: they with early care Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare. The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride, And well-calk\u2019d galleys in the harbour ride. Then oaks for oars they fell\u2019d; or, as they stood, Of its green arms despoil\u2019d the growing wood, Studious of flight. The beach is cover\u2019d o\u2019er With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore: On ev\u2019ry side are seen, descending down, Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town. Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants, Fearful of winter, and of future wants, T\u2019 invade the corn, and to their cells convey The plunder\u2019d forage of their yellow prey. The sable troops, along the narrow tracks, Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs: Some set their shoulders to the pond\u2019rous grain; Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train; All ply their sev\u2019ral tasks, and equal toil sustain. What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore, When, from the tow\u2019r, she saw the cover\u2019d shore, And heard the shouts of sailors from afar, Mix\u2019d with the murmurs of the wat\u2019ry war!"], "Who reminds Aeneas of his duty to get to Italy?": [" This way and that th\u2019 impatient captives tend, And, pressing for release, the mountains rend. High in his hall th\u2019 undaunted monarch stands, And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands; Which did he not, their unresisted sway Would sweep the world before them in their way; Earth, air, and seas thro\u2019 empty space would roll, And heav\u2019n would fly before the driving soul. In fear of this, the Father of the Gods Confin\u2019d their fury to those dark abodes, And lock\u2019d \u2019em safe within, oppress\u2019d with mountain loads; Impos\u2019d a king, with arbitrary sway, To loose their fetters, or their force allay. To whom the suppliant queen her pray\u2019rs address\u2019d, And thus the tenor of her suit express\u2019d: \u201cO Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav\u2019n The pow\u2019r of tempests and of winds has giv\u2019n; Thy force alone their fury can restrain, And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main. A race of wand\u2019ring slaves, abhorr\u2019d by me, With prosp\u2019rous passage cut the Tuscan sea; To fruitful Italy their course they steer, And for their vanquish\u2019d gods design new temples there. Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies; Sink or disperse my fatal enemies. Twice sev\u2019n, the charming daughters of the main, Around my person wait, and bear my train: Succeed my wish, and second my design; The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine, And make thee father of a happy line.\u201d To this the god: \u201c\u2019Tis yours, O queen, to will The work which duty binds me to fulfil.", " Accept whate\u2019er Aeneas can afford; Untouch\u2019d thy arms, untaken be thy sword; And all that pleas\u2019d thee living, still remain Inviolate, and sacred to the slain. Thy body on thy parents I bestow, To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know, Or have a sense of human things below. There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell: \u2018\u2019Twas by the great Aeneas hand I fell.\u2019\u201d With this, his distant friends he beckons near, Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear: Himself assists to lift him from the ground, With clotted locks, and blood that well\u2019d from out the wound. Meantime, his father, now no father, stood, And wash\u2019d his wounds by Tiber\u2019s yellow flood: Oppress\u2019d with anguish, panting, and o\u2019erspent, His fainting limbs against an oak he leant. A bough his brazen helmet did sustain; His heavier arms lay scatter\u2019d on the plain: A chosen train of youth around him stand; His drooping head was rested on his hand: His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought; And all on Lausus ran his restless thought. Careful, concern\u2019d his danger to prevent, He much enquir\u2019d, and many a message sent To warn him from the field\u2014alas! in vain! Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain! O\u2019er his broad shield still gush\u2019d the yawning wound, And drew a bloody trail along the ground. Far off he heard their cries, far off divin\u2019d The dire event, with a foreboding mind. With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head; Then both his lifted hands to heav\u2019n he spread; Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said: \u201cWhat joys, alas!", " The heads of these with holy fillets bound, And all their temples were with garlands crown\u2019d. To these the Sibyl thus her speech address\u2019d, And first to him surrounded by the rest Tow\u2019ring his height, and ample was his breast; \u201cSay, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say, Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way To find the hero, for whose only sake We sought the dark abodes, and cross\u2019d the bitter lake?\u201d To this the sacred poet thus replied: \u201cIn no fix\u2019d place the happy souls reside. In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, By crystal streams, that murmur thro\u2019 the meads: But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; The path conducts you to your journey\u2019s end.\u201d This said, he led them up the mountain\u2019s brow, And shews them all the shining fields below. They wind the hill, and thro\u2019 the blissful meadows go. But old Anchises, in a flow\u2019ry vale, Review\u2019d his muster\u2019d race, and took the tale: Those happy spirits, which, ordain\u2019d by fate, For future beings and new bodies wait. With studious thought observ\u2019d th\u2019 illustrious throng, In nature\u2019s order as they pass\u2019d along: Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care, In peaceful senates and successful war. He, when Aeneas on the plain appears, Meets him with open arms, and falling tears. \u201cWelcome,\u201d he said, \u201cthe gods\u2019 undoubted race! O long expected to my dear embrace! Once more \u2019tis giv\u2019n me to behold your face! The love and pious duty which you pay Have pass\u2019d the perils of so hard a way.", " Upon this, Aeneas, by the advice of one of his generals, and a vision of his father, builds a city for the women, old men, and others, who were either unfit for war, or weary of the voyage, and sails for Italy. Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting only his pilot Palinurus, who was unfortunately lost. Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat\u2019ry way, Fix\u2019d on his voyage, thro\u2019 the curling sea; Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze. The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind The fate of Dido from the fire divin\u2019d; He knew the stormy souls of womankind, What secret springs their eager passions move, How capable of death for injur\u2019d love. Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw; Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw. Now seas and skies their prospect only bound; An empty space above, a floating field around. But soon the heav\u2019ns with shadows were o\u2019erspread; A swelling cloud hung hov\u2019ring o\u2019er their head: Livid it look\u2019d, the threat\u2019ning of a storm: Then night and horror ocean\u2019s face deform. The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud: \u201cWhat gusts of weather from that gath\u2019ring cloud My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.\u201d The frighted crew perform the task assign\u2019d. Then, to his fearless chief: \u201cNot Heav\u2019n,\u201d said he, \u201cTho\u2019 Jove himself should promise Italy, Can stem the torrent of this raging sea."], "How does Dido die?": [" \u201cDescending thence, I scape thro\u2019 foes and fire: Before the goddess, foes and flames retire. Arriv\u2019d at home, he, for whose only sake, Or most for his, such toils I undertake, The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight, I purpos\u2019d to secure on Ida\u2019s height, Refus\u2019d the journey, resolute to die And add his fun\u2019rals to the fate of Troy, Rather than exile and old age sustain. \u2018Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev\u2019ry vein. Had Heav\u2019n decreed that I should life enjoy, Heav\u2019n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. \u2019Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, And give this useless corpse a long adieu. These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; At least the pitying foes will aid my death, To take my spoils, and leave my body bare: As for my sepulcher, let Heav\u2019n take care. \u2019Tis long since I, for my celestial wife Loath\u2019d by the gods, have dragg\u2019d a ling\u2019ring life; Since ev\u2019ry hour and moment I expire, Blasted from heav\u2019n by Jove\u2019s avenging fire.\u2019 This oft repeated, he stood fix\u2019d to die: Myself, my wife, my son, my family, Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry. \u2018What, will he still persist, on death resolve, And in his ruin all his house involve!\u2019 He still persists his reasons to maintain; Our pray\u2019rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. \u201cUrg\u2019d by despair, again I go to try The fate of arms, resolv\u2019d in fight to die: \u2018What hope remains, but what my death must give?", " The town of Camarine from far we see, And fenny lake, undrain\u2019d by fate\u2019s decree.

BOOK IV THE ARGUMENT. Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus\u2019 consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Aeneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed.", " Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are: A people rude in peace, and rough in war. The rising city, which from far you see, Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. Phoenician Dido rules the growing state, Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother\u2019s hate. Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, Possess\u2019d fair Dido\u2019s bed; and either heart At once was wounded with an equal dart. Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway\u2019d: One who condemn\u2019d divine and human laws. Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, With steel invades his brother\u2019s life by stealth; Before the sacred altar made him bleed, And long from her conceal\u2019d the cruel deed. Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin\u2019d, To soothe his sister, and delude her mind. At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares, And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. The cruel altars and his fate he tells, And the dire secret of his house reveals, Then warns the widow, with her household gods, To seek a refuge in remote abodes. Last, to support her in so long a way, He shows her where his hidden treasure lay. Admonish\u2019d thus, and seiz\u2019d with mortal fright, The queen provides companions of her flight: They meet, and all combine to leave the state, Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.", " Soon as approach\u2019d, upon his knees he falls, And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls: \u2018Now, by the pow\u2019rs above, and what we share From Nature\u2019s common gift, this vital air, O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more; But bear me far from this unhappy shore. \u2019Tis true, I am a Greek, and farther own, Among your foes besieg\u2019d th\u2019 imperial town. For such demerits if my death be due, No more for this abandon\u2019d life I sue; This only favour let my tears obtain, To throw me headlong in the rapid main: Since nothing more than death my crime demands, I die content, to die by human hands.\u2019 He said, and on his knees my knees embrac\u2019d: I bade him boldly tell his fortune past, His present state, his lineage, and his name, Th\u2019 occasion of his fears, and whence he came. The good Anchises rais\u2019d him with his hand; Who, thus encourag\u2019d, answer\u2019d our demand: \u2018From Ithaca, my native soil, I came To Troy; and Achaemenides my name. Me my poor father with Ulysses sent; (O had I stay\u2019d, with poverty content!) But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen Left me forsaken in the Cyclops\u2019 den. The cave, tho\u2019 large, was dark; the dismal floor Was pav\u2019d with mangled limbs and putrid gore. Our monstrous host, of more than human size, Erects his head, and stares within the skies; Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue. Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view! The joints of slaughter\u2019d wretches are his food; And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood."], "Why does Turnus decide to march on Aeneas's camp?": [" And here the tam\u2019d Euphrates humbly glides, And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; The Danes\u2019 unconquer\u2019d offspring march behind, And Morini, the last of humankind. These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, By Vulcan labour\u2019d, and by Venus brought, With joy and wonder fill the hero\u2019s thought. Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. BOOK IX THE ARGUMENT. Turnus takes advantage of Aeneas\u2019s absence, fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea nymphs,) and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduced to the last extremities, send Ninus and Euryalus to recall Aeneas; which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and the conclusion of their adventure. While these affairs in distant places pass\u2019d, The various Iris Juno sends with haste, To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, The secret shade of his great grandsire sought. Retir\u2019d alone she found the daring man, And op\u2019d her rosy lips, and thus began: \u201cWhat none of all the gods could grant thy vows, That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. Aeneas, gone to seek th\u2019 Arcadian prince, Has left the Trojan camp without defence; And, short of succours there, employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs; Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.\u201d This said, on equal wings she pois\u2019d her weight, And form\u2019d a radiant rainbow in her flight.", " Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " But young Ascanius, in his camp distress\u2019d, By your insulting foes is hardly press\u2019d. Th\u2019 Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host, Advance in order on the Latian coast: To cut their way the Daunian chief designs, Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines. Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light, First arm thy soldiers for th\u2019 ensuing fight: Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield, And bear aloft th\u2019 impenetrable shield. Tomorrow\u2019s sun, unless my skill be vain, Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain.\u201d Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force Push\u2019d on the vessel in her wat\u2019ry course; For well she knew the way. Impell\u2019d behind, The ship flew forward, and outstripp\u2019d the wind. The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause, The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws. Then thus he pray\u2019d, and fix\u2019d on heav\u2019n his eyes: \u201cHear thou, great Mother of the deities. With turrets crown\u2019d! (on Ida\u2019s holy hill Fierce tigers, rein\u2019d and curb\u2019d, obey thy will.) Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight; And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right.\u201d He said no more. And now renewing day Had chas\u2019d the shadows of the night away. He charg\u2019d the soldiers, with preventing care, Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare; Warn\u2019d of th\u2019 ensuing fight, and bade \u2019em hope the war. Now, his lofty poop, he view\u2019d below His camp incompass\u2019d, and th\u2019 inclosing foe. His blazing shield, imbrac\u2019d, he held on high; The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply.", " Amid the press appears the beauteous boy, The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy. His lovely face unarm\u2019d, his head was bare; In ringlets o\u2019er his shoulders hung his hair. His forehead circled with a diadem; Distinguish\u2019d from the crowd, he shines a gem, Enchas\u2019d in gold, or polish\u2019d iv\u2019ry set, Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet. Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war, Directing pointed arrows from afar, And death with poison arm\u2019d\u2014in Lydia born, Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn; Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands, And leaves a rich manure of golden sands. There Capys, author of the Capuan name, And there was Mnestheus too, increas\u2019d in fame, Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame. Thus mortal war was wag\u2019d on either side. Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide: For, anxious, from Evander when he went, He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon\u2019s tent; Expos\u2019d the cause of coming to the chief; His name and country told, and ask\u2019d relief; Propos\u2019d the terms; his own small strength declar\u2019d; What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar\u2019d: What Turnus, bold and violent, design\u2019d; Then shew\u2019d the slipp\u2019ry state of humankind, And fickle fortune; warn\u2019d him to beware, And to his wholesome counsel added pray\u2019r. Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs, And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins. They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand; Their forces trusted with a foreign hand."], "Why is Turnus unsuccessful in his attempt to burn Aeneas's ships?": [" He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod. And now at length the number\u2019d hours were come, Prefix\u2019d by fate\u2019s irrevocable doom, When the great Mother of the Gods was free To save her ships, and finish Jove\u2019s decree. First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung A light that sign\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, and shot along; Then from a cloud, fring\u2019d round with golden fires, Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs; And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds, Both hosts, in arms oppos\u2019d, with equal horror wounds: \u201cO Trojan race, your needless aid forbear, And know, my ships are my peculiar care. With greater ease the bold Rutulian may, With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea, Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge, Loos\u2019d from your crooked anchors, launch at large, Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand, And swim the seas, at Cybele\u2019s command.\u201d No sooner had the goddess ceas\u2019d to speak, When, lo! th\u2019 obedient ships their haulsers break; And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again: As many beauteous maids the billows sweep, As rode before tall vessels on the deep. The foes, surpris\u2019d with wonder, stood aghast; Messapus curb\u2019d his fiery courser\u2019s haste; Old Tiber roar\u2019d, and, raising up his head, Call\u2019d back his waters to their oozy bed. Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, And with these words his trembling troops bespoke: \u201cThese monsters for the Trojans\u2019 fate are meant, And are by Jove for black presages sent.", " But I, the consort of the Thunderer, Have wag\u2019d a long and unsuccessful war, With various arts and arms in vain have toil\u2019d, And by a mortal man at length am foil\u2019d. If native pow\u2019r prevail not, shall I doubt To seek for needful succour from without? If Jove and Heav\u2019n my just desires deny, Hell shall the pow\u2019r of Heav\u2019n and Jove supply. Grant that the Fates have firm\u2019d, by their decree, The Trojan race to reign in Italy; At least I can defer the nuptial day, And with protracted wars the peace delay: With blood the dear alliance shall be bought, And both the people near destruction brought; So shall the son-in-law and father join, With ruin, war, and waste of either line. O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow\u2019d With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood! Bellona leads thee to thy lover\u2019s hand; Another queen brings forth another brand, To burn with foreign fires another land! A second Paris, diff\u2019ring but in name, Shall fire his country with a second flame.\u201d Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground, With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound, To rouse Alecto from th\u2019 infernal seat Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat. This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose; One who delights in wars and human woes. Ev\u2019n Pluto hates his own misshapen race; Her sister Furies fly her hideous face; So frightful are the forms the monster takes, So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes.", " Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " And here the tam\u2019d Euphrates humbly glides, And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; The Danes\u2019 unconquer\u2019d offspring march behind, And Morini, the last of humankind. These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, By Vulcan labour\u2019d, and by Venus brought, With joy and wonder fill the hero\u2019s thought. Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. BOOK IX THE ARGUMENT. Turnus takes advantage of Aeneas\u2019s absence, fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea nymphs,) and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduced to the last extremities, send Ninus and Euryalus to recall Aeneas; which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and the conclusion of their adventure. While these affairs in distant places pass\u2019d, The various Iris Juno sends with haste, To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, The secret shade of his great grandsire sought. Retir\u2019d alone she found the daring man, And op\u2019d her rosy lips, and thus began: \u201cWhat none of all the gods could grant thy vows, That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. Aeneas, gone to seek th\u2019 Arcadian prince, Has left the Trojan camp without defence; And, short of succours there, employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs; Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.\u201d This said, on equal wings she pois\u2019d her weight, And form\u2019d a radiant rainbow in her flight."], "What do Nisus and Euryalus do as they sneak through the Latin camp?": [" The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall, By turns relieve each other on the wall. Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance, To watch the gate was warlike Nisus\u2019 chance. His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; His mother was a huntress of the wood, And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, But better skill\u2019d unerring shafts to send. Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend: Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast. Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. One was their care, and their delight was one: One common hazard in the war they shar\u2019d, And now were both by choice upon the guard. Then Nisus thus: \u201cOr do the gods inspire This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? A gen\u2019rous ardour boils within my breast, Eager of action, enemy to rest: This urges me to fight, and fires my mind To leave a memorable name behind. Thou see\u2019st the foe secure; how faintly shine Their scatter\u2019d fires! the most, in sleep supine Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; All hush\u2019d around. Now hear what I revolve\u2014 A thought unripe\u2014and scarcely yet resolve. Our absent prince both camp and council mourn; By message both would hasten his return: If they confer what I demand on thee, (For fame is recompense enough for me,) Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied A way that safely will my passage guide.\u201d Euryalus stood list\u2019ning while he spoke, With love of praise and noble envy struck; Then to his ardent friend expos\u2019d his mind: \u201cAll this, alone, and leaving me behind!", " Yet, for his galley sav\u2019d, the grateful prince Is pleas\u2019d th\u2019 unhappy chief to recompense. Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care, Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair. From thence his way the Trojan hero bent Into the neighb\u2019ring plain, with mountains pent, Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. Full in the midst of this fair valley stood A native theatre, which, rising slow By just degrees, o\u2019erlook\u2019d the ground below. High on a sylvan throne the leader sate; A num\u2019rous train attend in solemn state. Here those that in the rapid course delight, Desire of honour and the prize invite. The rival runners without order stand; The Trojans mix\u2019d with the Sicilian band. First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears; Euryalus a boy of blooming years, With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown\u2019d; Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown\u2019d. Diores next, of Priam\u2019s royal race, Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place; But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, And Salius his from Arcananian earth; Then two Sicilian youths, the names of these, Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes: Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, And owning old Acestes for their head; With sev\u2019ral others of ignobler name, Whom time has not deliver\u2019d o\u2019er to fame. To these the hero thus his thoughts explain\u2019d, In words which gen\u2019ral approbation gain\u2019d: \u201cOne common largess is for all design\u2019d, The vanquish\u2019d and the victor shall be join\u2019d, Two darts of polish\u2019d steel and Gnosian wood, A silver-studded ax alike bestow\u2019d.", " The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed: The first of these obtains a stately steed, Adorn\u2019d with trappings; and the next in fame, The quiver of an Amazonian dame, With feather\u2019d Thracian arrows well supplied: A golden belt shall gird his manly side, Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied. The third this Grecian helmet shall content.\u201d He said. To their appointed base they went; With beating hearts th\u2019 expected sign receive, And, starting all at once, the barrier leave. Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew, And seiz\u2019d the distant goal with greedy view. Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o\u2019erpass\u2019d; Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste. The next, but tho\u2019 the next, yet far disjoin\u2019d, Came Salius, and Euryalus behind; Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied, Step after step, and almost side by side, His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space, Had won, or left at least a dubious race. Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last, When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste, Slipp\u2019d first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, Soak\u2019d with the blood of oxen newly slain. The careless victor had not mark\u2019d his way; But, treading where the treach\u2019rous puddle lay, His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor He fell, besmear\u2019d with filth and holy gore. Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee, Nor of the sacred bonds of amity, He strove th\u2019 immediate rival\u2019s hope to cross, And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.", " So Salius lay extended on the plain; Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend The victor to the goal, who vanquish\u2019d by his friend. Next Helymus; and then Diores came, By two misfortunes made the third in fame. But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd; Urges his cause may in the court be heard; And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr\u2019d. But favour for Euryalus appears; His blooming beauty, with his tender tears, Had brib\u2019d the judges for the promis\u2019d prize. Besides, Diores fills the court with cries, Who vainly reaches at the last reward, If the first palm on Salius be conferr\u2019d. Then thus the prince: \u201cLet no disputes arise: Where fortune plac\u2019d it, I award the prize. But fortune\u2019s errors give me leave to mend, At least to pity my deserving friend.\u201d He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws (Pond\u2019rous with shaggy mane and golden paws) A lion\u2019s hide: to Salius this he gives. Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves. \u201cIf such rewards to vanquish\u2019d men are due.\u201d He said, \u201cand falling is to rise by you, What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim, Who merited the first rewards and fame? In falling, both an equal fortune tried; Would fortune for my fall so well provide!\u201d With this he pointed to his face, and show\u2019d His hand and all his habit smear\u2019d with blood. Th\u2019 indulgent father of the people smil\u2019d, And caus\u2019d to be produc\u2019d an ample shield, Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought, Long since from Neptune\u2019s bars in triumph brought."], "Who revives the Trojans' fortunes during the attack on their fortress?": [" And here the tam\u2019d Euphrates humbly glides, And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; The Danes\u2019 unconquer\u2019d offspring march behind, And Morini, the last of humankind. These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, By Vulcan labour\u2019d, and by Venus brought, With joy and wonder fill the hero\u2019s thought.

Thus to the gods their perfect honours done, More cheerful, to my good old sire I run, And tell the pleasing news. In little space He found his error of the double race; Not, as before he deem\u2019d, deriv\u2019d from Crete; No more deluded by the doubtful seat: Then said: \u2018O son, turmoil\u2019d in Trojan fate! Such things as these Cassandra did relate. This day revives within my mind what she Foretold of Troy renew\u2019d in Italy, And Latian lands; but who could then have thought That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought, Or who believ\u2019d what mad Cassandra taught? Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.\u2019 \u201cHe said; and we with glad consent obey, Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, We spread our sails before the willing wind. Now from the sight of land our galleys move, With only seas around and skies above; When o\u2019er our heads descends a burst of rain, And night with sable clouds involves the main; The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; The scatter\u2019d fleet is forc\u2019d to sev\u2019ral ways; The face of heav\u2019n is ravish\u2019d from our eyes, And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. Cast from our course, we wander in the dark. No stars to guide, no point of land to mark. Ev\u2019n Palinurus no distinction found Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign\u2019d around. Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays, Without distinction, and three sunless days; The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds, We view a rising land, like distant clouds; The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight, And curling smoke ascending from their height.", " These with success are fir\u2019d, and those with rage, And each on equal terms at length engage. Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain, The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain. Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought, When suddenly th\u2019 unhop\u2019d-for news was brought, The foes had left the fastness of their place, Prevail\u2019d in fight, and had his men in chase. He quits th\u2019 attack, and, to prevent their fate, Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate. The first he met, Antiphates the brave, But base-begotten on a Theban slave, Sarpedon\u2019s son, he slew: the deadly dart Found passage thro\u2019 his breast, and pierc\u2019d his heart. Fix\u2019d in the wound th\u2019 Italian cornel stood, Warm\u2019d in his lungs, and in his vital blood. Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies, And Meropes, and the gigantic size Of Bitias, threat\u2019ning with his ardent eyes. Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress\u2019d (A dart were lost within that roomy breast), But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong, Which roar\u2019d like thunder as it whirl\u2019d along: Not two bull hides th\u2019 impetuous force withhold, Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold. Down sunk the monster bulk and press\u2019d the ground; His arms and clatt\u2019ring shield on the vast body sound, Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole, Rais\u2019d on the seas, the surges to control\u2014 At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall; Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall Of the vast pile; the scatter\u2019d ocean flies; Black sands, discolour\u2019d froth, and mingled mud arise: The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores; Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars: Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove\u2019s command, Astonish\u2019d at the flaw that shakes the land, Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake, With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back.", " The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin\u2019d; If acts of mercy touch their heav\u2019nly mind, And, more than all the gods, your gen\u2019rous heart. Conscious of worth, requite its own desert! In you this age is happy, and this earth, And parents more than mortal gave you birth. While rolling rivers into seas shall run, And round the space of heav\u2019n the radiant sun; While trees the mountain tops with shades supply, Your honour, name, and praise shall never die. Whate\u2019er abode my fortune has assign\u2019d, Your image shall be present in my mind.\u201d Thus having said, he turn\u2019d with pious haste, And joyful his expecting friends embrac\u2019d: With his right hand Ilioneus was grac\u2019d, Serestus with his left; then to his breast Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press\u2019d; And so by turns descended to the rest. The Tyrian queen stood fix\u2019d upon his face, Pleas\u2019d with his motions, ravish\u2019d with his grace; Admir\u2019d his fortunes, more admir\u2019d the man; Then recollected stood, and thus began: \u201cWhat fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow\u2019rs Have cast you shipwreck\u2019d on our barren shores? Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame, Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore To fam\u2019d Anchises on th\u2019 Idaean shore? It calls into my mind, tho\u2019 then a child, When Teucer came, from Salamis exil\u2019d, And sought my father\u2019s aid, to be restor\u2019d: My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare, And, conqu\u2019ring, finish\u2019d the successful war."], "Why does Turnus flee the Trojans' fortress?": [" Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " There stood a tow\u2019r, amazing to the sight, Built up of beams, and of stupendous height: Art, and the nature of the place, conspir\u2019d To furnish all the strength that war requir\u2019d. To level this, the bold Italians join; The wary Trojans obviate their design; With weighty stones o\u2019erwhelm their troops below, Shoot thro\u2019 the loopholes, and sharp jav\u2019lins throw. Turnus, the chief, toss\u2019d from his thund\u2019ring hand Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand: It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; The planks were season\u2019d, and the timber dry. Contagion caught the posts; it spread along, Scorch\u2019d, and to distance drove the scatter\u2019d throng. The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain, Still gath\u2019ring fast upon the trembling train; Till, crowding to the corners of the wall, Down the defence and the defenders fall. The mighty flaw makes heav\u2019n itself resound: The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground. The tow\u2019r, that follow\u2019d on the fallen crew, Whelm\u2019d o\u2019er their heads, and buried whom it slew: Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent; All the same equal ruin underwent. Young Lycus and Helenor only scape; Sav\u2019d\u2014how, they know not\u2014from the steepy leap. Helenor, elder of the two: by birth, On one side royal, one a son of earth, Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare, And sent her boasted bastard to the war (A privilege which none but freemen share). Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield: No marks of honour charg\u2019d its empty field.", " How fierce in fight, with courage undecay\u2019d! Judge if such warriors want immortal aid.\u201d To whom the goddess with the charming eyes, Soft in her tone, submissively replies: \u201cWhy, O my sov\u2019reign lord, whose frown I fear, And cannot, unconcern\u2019d, your anger bear; Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still (As once I was) were mistress of your will, From your almighty pow\u2019r your pleasing wife Might gain the grace of length\u2019ning Turnus\u2019 life, Securely snatch him from the fatal fight, And give him to his aged father\u2019s sight. Now let him perish, since you hold it good, And glut the Trojans with his pious blood. Yet from our lineage he derives his name, And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came; Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine, And offers daily incense at your shrine.\u201d Then shortly thus the sov\u2019reign god replied: \u201cSince in my pow\u2019r and goodness you confide, If for a little space, a lengthen\u2019d span, You beg reprieve for this expiring man, I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence From instant fate, and can so far dispense. But, if some secret meaning lies beneath, To save the short-liv\u2019d youth from destin\u2019d death, Or if a farther thought you entertain, To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.\u201d To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes: \u201cAnd what if that request, your tongue denies, Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve, But length of certain life, to Turnus give?", " You beg a truce, which I would gladly give, Not only for the slain, but those who live. I came not hither but by Heav\u2019n\u2019s command, And sent by fate to share the Latian land. Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied My proffer\u2019d friendship, and my promis\u2019d bride; Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.

First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung A light that sign\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, and shot along; Then from a cloud, fring\u2019d round with golden fires, Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs; And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds, Both hosts, in arms oppos\u2019d, with equal horror wounds: \u201cO Trojan race, your needless aid forbear, And know, my ships are my peculiar care.

The foes, surpris\u2019d with wonder, stood aghast; Messapus curb\u2019d his fiery courser\u2019s haste; Old Tiber roar\u2019d, and, raising up his head, Call\u2019d back his waters to their oozy bed. Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, And with these words his trembling troops bespoke: \u201cThese monsters for the Trojans\u2019 fate are meant, And are by Jove for black presages sent.", " Next, for his friends and royal host he sent, Reveal\u2019d his vision, and the gods\u2019 intent, With his own purpose.

Behold your own Ascanius!\u201d While he said, He drew his glitt\u2019ring helmet from his head, In which the youths to sportful arms he led. By this, Aeneas and his train appear; And now the women, seiz\u2019d with shame and fear, Dispers\u2019d, to woods and caverns take their flight, Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; Their friends acknowledge, and their error find, And shake the goddess from their alter\u2019d mind. Not so the raging fires their fury cease, But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, Work on their way amid the smould\u2019ring tow, Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.

Down to the keels, and upward to the sails, The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; Nor buckets pour\u2019d, nor strength of human hand, Can the victorious element withstand. The pious hero rends his robe, and throws To heav\u2019n his hands, and with his hands his vows. \u201cO Jove,\u201d he cried, \u201cif pray\u2019rs can yet have place; If thou abhorr\u2019st not all the Dardan race; If any spark of pity still remain; If gods are gods, and not invok\u2019d in vain; Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!", " Yet from the flames our burning vessels free, Or let thy fury fall alone on me!

Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim, Creusa had, and only want the name. Whate\u2019er event thy bold attempt shall have, \u2019Tis merit to have borne a son so brave.", " Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain A death so ling\u2019ring, and so full of pain, Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife Of lab\u2019ring nature, and dissolve her life. For since she died, not doom\u2019d by Heav\u2019n\u2019s decree, Or her own crime, but human casualty, And rage of love, that plung\u2019d her in despair, The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair, Which Proserpine and they can only know; Nor made her sacred to the shades below. Downward the various goddess took her flight, And drew a thousand colours from the light; Then stood above the dying lover\u2019s head, And said: \u201cI thus devote thee to the dead. This off\u2019ring to th\u2019 infernal gods I bear.\u201d Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: The struggling soul was loos\u2019d, and life dissolv\u2019d in air. BOOK V THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage. He applies himself to celebrate the memory of his father with divine honours, and accordingly institues funeral games, and appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the ceremonies are performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan woman to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them: which burned four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous shower extinguished it.", " Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join\u2019d? Think\u2019st thou I can my share of glory yield, Or send thee unassisted to the field? Not so my father taught my childhood arms; Born in a siege, and bred among alarms! Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend, Nor of the heav\u2019n-born hero I attend. The thing call\u2019d life, with ease I can disclaim, And think it over-sold to purchase fame.\u201d Then Nisus thus: \u201cAlas! thy tender years Would minister new matter to my fears. So may the gods, who view this friendly strife, Restore me to thy lov\u2019d embrace with life, Condemn\u2019d to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,) This thy request is cruel and unjust. But if some chance\u2014as many chances are, And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war\u2014 If one should reach my head, there let it fall, And spare thy life; I would not perish all. Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date: Live thou to mourn thy love\u2019s unhappy fate; To bear my mangled body from the foe, Or buy it back, and fun\u2019ral rites bestow. Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny, Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply. O let not me the widow\u2019s tears renew! Nor let a mother\u2019s curse my name pursue: Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee, Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily, Her age committing to the seas and wind, When ev\u2019ry weary matron stay\u2019d behind.\u201d To this, Euryalus: \u201cYou plead in vain, And but protract the cause you cannot gain. No more delays, but haste!\u201d With that, he wakes The nodding watch; each to his office takes."], "What does the ghost of Anchises tell Aeneas he must do before going to Latium?": [" Aeneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years\u2019 siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he met with in defence of it. At last, having been before advised by Hector\u2019s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him. All were attentive to the godlike man, When from his lofty couch he thus began: \u201cGreat queen, what you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: An empire from its old foundations rent, And ev\u2019ry woe the Trojans underwent; A peopled city made a desert place; All that I saw, and part of which I was: Not ev\u2019n the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. And now the latter watch of wasting night, And setting stars, to kindly rest invite; But, since you take such int\u2019rest in our woe, And Troy\u2019s disastrous end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell.", " Call them not Trojans: perish the renown And name of Troy, with that detested town. Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign And Rome\u2019s immortal majesty remain.\u201d Then thus the founder of mankind replies (Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes) \u201cCan Saturn\u2019s issue, and heav\u2019n\u2019s other heir, Such endless anger in her bosom bear? Be mistress, and your full desires obtain; But quench the choler you foment in vain. From ancient blood th\u2019 Ausonian people sprung, Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue. The Trojans to their customs shall be tied: I will, myself, their common rites provide; The natives shall command, the foreigners subside. All shall be Latium; Troy without a name; And her lost sons forget from whence they came. From blood so mix\u2019d, a pious race shall flow, Equal to gods, excelling all below. No nation more respect to you shall pay, Or greater off\u2019rings on your altars lay.\u201d Juno consents, well pleas\u2019d that her desires Had found success, and from the cloud retires. The peace thus made, the Thund\u2019rer next prepares To force the wat\u2019ry goddess from the wars. Deep in the dismal regions void of light, Three daughters at a birth were born to Night: These their brown mother, brooding on her care, Indued with windy wings to flit in air, With serpents girt alike, and crown\u2019d with hissing hair. In heav\u2019n the Dirae call\u2019d, and still at hand, Before the throne of angry Jove they stand, His ministers of wrath, and ready still The minds of mortal men with fears to fill, Whene\u2019er the moody sire, to wreak his hate On realms or towns deserving of their fate, Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care, And terrifies the guilty world with war.", " Of various things discoursing as he pass\u2019d, Anchises hither bends his steps at last. Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn\u2019d to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII THE ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call\u2019d from thee, The nurse of great Aeneas\u2019 infancy. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia\u2019s plains; Thy name (\u2019tis all a ghost can have) remains. Now, when the prince her fun\u2019ral rites had paid, He plow\u2019d the Tyrrhene seas with sails display\u2019d. From land a gentle breeze arose by night, Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, And the sea trembled with her silver light. Now near the shelves of Circe\u2019s shores they run, (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) A dang\u2019rous coast: the goddess wastes her days In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, And cedar brands supply her father\u2019s light.", " Mark how the shifting winds from west arise, And what collected night involves the skies! Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea, Much less against the tempest force their way. \u2019Tis fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. Not far from hence, if I observ\u2019d aright The southing of the stars, and polar light, Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores In safety we may reach with struggling oars.\u201d Aeneas then replied: \u201cToo sure I find We strive in vain against the seas and wind: Now shift your sails; what place can please me more Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, Whose hallow\u2019d earth Anchises\u2019 bones contains, And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?\u201d The course resolv\u2019d, before the western wind They scud amain, and make the port assign\u2019d. Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, Beheld the fleet descending on the land; And, not unmindful of his ancient race, Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, And held the hero in a strict embrace. Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, And either hand a pointed jav\u2019lin bore. His mother was a dame of Dardan blood; His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. He welcomes his returning friends ashore With plenteous country cates and homely store. Now, when the following morn had chas\u2019d away The flying stars, and light restor\u2019d the day, Aeneas call\u2019d the Trojan troops around, And thus bespoke them from a rising ground: \u201cOffspring of heav\u2019n, divine Dardanian race!"], "Why does Palinurus die on the voyage to Italy?": [" Upon this, Aeneas, by the advice of one of his generals, and a vision of his father, builds a city for the women, old men, and others, who were either unfit for war, or weary of the voyage, and sails for Italy. Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting only his pilot Palinurus, who was unfortunately lost. Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat\u2019ry way, Fix\u2019d on his voyage, thro\u2019 the curling sea; Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze. The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind The fate of Dido from the fire divin\u2019d; He knew the stormy souls of womankind, What secret springs their eager passions move, How capable of death for injur\u2019d love. Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw; Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw. Now seas and skies their prospect only bound; An empty space above, a floating field around. But soon the heav\u2019ns with shadows were o\u2019erspread; A swelling cloud hung hov\u2019ring o\u2019er their head: Livid it look\u2019d, the threat\u2019ning of a storm: Then night and horror ocean\u2019s face deform. The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud: \u201cWhat gusts of weather from that gath\u2019ring cloud My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.\u201d The frighted crew perform the task assign\u2019d. Then, to his fearless chief: \u201cNot Heav\u2019n,\u201d said he, \u201cTho\u2019 Jove himself should promise Italy, Can stem the torrent of this raging sea.", " To heav\u2019n I lift my hands with pious haste, And sacred incense in the flames I cast. Thus to the gods their perfect honours done, More cheerful, to my good old sire I run, And tell the pleasing news. In little space He found his error of the double race; Not, as before he deem\u2019d, deriv\u2019d from Crete; No more deluded by the doubtful seat: Then said: \u2018O son, turmoil\u2019d in Trojan fate! Such things as these Cassandra did relate. This day revives within my mind what she Foretold of Troy renew\u2019d in Italy, And Latian lands; but who could then have thought That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought, Or who believ\u2019d what mad Cassandra taught? Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.\u2019 \u201cHe said; and we with glad consent obey, Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, We spread our sails before the willing wind. Now from the sight of land our galleys move, With only seas around and skies above; When o\u2019er our heads descends a burst of rain, And night with sable clouds involves the main; The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; The scatter\u2019d fleet is forc\u2019d to sev\u2019ral ways; The face of heav\u2019n is ravish\u2019d from our eyes, And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. Cast from our course, we wander in the dark. No stars to guide, no point of land to mark. Ev\u2019n Palinurus no distinction found Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign\u2019d around. Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays, Without distinction, and three sunless days; The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds, We view a rising land, like distant clouds; The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight, And curling smoke ascending from their height.", " \u201cDescending thence, I scape thro\u2019 foes and fire: Before the goddess, foes and flames retire. Arriv\u2019d at home, he, for whose only sake, Or most for his, such toils I undertake, The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight, I purpos\u2019d to secure on Ida\u2019s height, Refus\u2019d the journey, resolute to die And add his fun\u2019rals to the fate of Troy, Rather than exile and old age sustain. \u2018Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev\u2019ry vein. Had Heav\u2019n decreed that I should life enjoy, Heav\u2019n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. \u2019Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, And give this useless corpse a long adieu. These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; At least the pitying foes will aid my death, To take my spoils, and leave my body bare: As for my sepulcher, let Heav\u2019n take care. \u2019Tis long since I, for my celestial wife Loath\u2019d by the gods, have dragg\u2019d a ling\u2019ring life; Since ev\u2019ry hour and moment I expire, Blasted from heav\u2019n by Jove\u2019s avenging fire.\u2019 This oft repeated, he stood fix\u2019d to die: Myself, my wife, my son, my family, Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry. \u2018What, will he still persist, on death resolve, And in his ruin all his house involve!\u2019 He still persists his reasons to maintain; Our pray\u2019rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. \u201cUrg\u2019d by despair, again I go to try The fate of arms, resolv\u2019d in fight to die: \u2018What hope remains, but what my death must give?", " Thus chang\u2019d, amidst the crying crowd she ran, Mix\u2019d with the matrons, and these words began: \u201cO wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow\u2019r, Nor flames, destroy\u2019d, in Troy\u2019s unhappy hour! O wretched we, reserv\u2019d by cruel fate, Beyond the ruins of the sinking state! Now sev\u2019n revolving years are wholly run, Since this improsp\u2019rous voyage we begun; Since, toss\u2019d from shores to shores, from lands to lands, Inhospitable rocks and barren sands, Wand\u2019ring in exile thro\u2019 the stormy sea, We search in vain for flying Italy. Now cast by fortune on this kindred land, What should our rest and rising walls withstand, Or hinder here to fix our banish\u2019d band? O country lost, and gods redeem\u2019d in vain, If still in endless exile we remain! Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew, Or streams of some dissembled Simois view! Haste, join with me, th\u2019 unhappy fleet consume! Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom. In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands (For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands: \u2018With these,\u2019 said she, \u2018these wand\u2019ring ships destroy: These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.\u2019 Time calls you now; the precious hour employ: Slack not the good presage, while Heav\u2019n inspires Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires. See! Neptune\u2019s altars minister their brands: The god is pleas\u2019d; the god supplies our hands.\u201d Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew, And, toss\u2019d in air, amidst the galleys threw."], "Whose temple does Aeneas go to when they reach Italy?": [" \u201cAnd now the rising morn with rosy light Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight; When we from far, like bluish mists, descry The hills, and then the plains, of Italy. Achates first pronounc\u2019d the joyful sound; Then, \u2018Italy!\u2019 the cheerful crew rebound. My sire Anchises crown\u2019d a cup with wine, And, off\u2019ring, thus implor\u2019d the pow\u2019rs divine: \u2018Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas, And you who raging winds and waves appease, Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp\u2019rous wind, And smooth our passage to the port assign\u2019d!\u2019 The gentle gales their flagging force renew, And now the happy harbour is in view. Minerva\u2019s temple then salutes our sight, Plac\u2019d, as a landmark, on the mountain\u2019s height. We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore; The curling waters round the galleys roar. The land lies open to the raging east, Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress\u2019d, Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain, And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain. The port lies hid within; on either side Two tow\u2019ring rocks the narrow mouth divide. The temple, which aloft we view\u2019d before, To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore. Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld Were four white steeds that cropp\u2019d the flow\u2019ry field. \u2018War, war is threaten\u2019d from this foreign ground,\u2019 My father cried, \u2018where warlike steeds are found. Yet, since reclaim\u2019d to chariots they submit, And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit, Peace may succeed to war.\u2019 Our way we bend To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend; There prostrate to the fierce Virago pray, Whose temple was the landmark of our way.", " Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, Whose mighty trunk had better grac\u2019d the wood, If Pallas had arriv\u2019d, with equal length Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd\u2019st in vain? Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, And, after Pallas\u2019 death, live ling\u2019ring on, \u2019Tis to behold his vengeance for my son. I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead. My son and I expect it from his hand; \u2019Tis all that he can give, or we demand. Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, To greet my Pallas with such news below.\u201d The morn had now dispell\u2019d the shades of night, Restoring toils, when she restor\u2019d the light. The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command To raise the piles along the winding strand. Their friends convey the dead fun\u2019ral fires; Black smould\u2019ring smoke from the green wood expires; The light of heav\u2019n is chok\u2019d, and the new day retires. Then thrice around the kindled piles they go (For ancient custom had ordain\u2019d it so) Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw The spoils, in battle taken from the foe: Helms, bits emboss\u2019d, and swords of shining steel; One casts a target, one a chariot wheel; Some to their fellows their own arms restore: The falchions which in luckless fight they bore, Their bucklers pierc\u2019d, their darts bestow\u2019d in vain, And shiver\u2019d lances gather\u2019d from the plain.", " Mark how the shifting winds from west arise, And what collected night involves the skies! Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea, Much less against the tempest force their way. \u2019Tis fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. Not far from hence, if I observ\u2019d aright The southing of the stars, and polar light, Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores In safety we may reach with struggling oars.\u201d Aeneas then replied: \u201cToo sure I find We strive in vain against the seas and wind: Now shift your sails; what place can please me more Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, Whose hallow\u2019d earth Anchises\u2019 bones contains, And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?\u201d The course resolv\u2019d, before the western wind They scud amain, and make the port assign\u2019d. Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, Beheld the fleet descending on the land; And, not unmindful of his ancient race, Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, And held the hero in a strict embrace. Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, And either hand a pointed jav\u2019lin bore. His mother was a dame of Dardan blood; His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. He welcomes his returning friends ashore With plenteous country cates and homely store. Now, when the following morn had chas\u2019d away The flying stars, and light restor\u2019d the day, Aeneas call\u2019d the Trojan troops around, And thus bespoke them from a rising ground: \u201cOffspring of heav\u2019n, divine Dardanian race!", " He first in open field defied the prince: But armour scal\u2019d with gold was no defence Against the fated sword, which open\u2019d wide His plated shield, and pierc\u2019d his naked side. Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born, Was from his wretched mother ripp\u2019d and torn; Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee; For his beginning life from biting steel was free. Not far from him was Gyas laid along, Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail\u2019d, Nor valour nor Herculean arms avail\u2019d, Nor their fam\u2019d father, wont in war to go With great Alcides, while he toil\u2019d below. The noisy Pharos next receiv\u2019d his death: Aeneas writh\u2019d his dart, and stopp\u2019d his bawling breath. Then wretched Cydon had receiv\u2019d his doom, Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, And sought with lust obscene polluted joys: The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys, Had not his sev\u2019n bold brethren stopp\u2019d the course Of the fierce champions, with united force. Sev\u2019n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: The rest had reach\u2019d him; but his mother\u2019s care Prevented those, and turn\u2019d aside in air. The prince then call\u2019d Achates, to supply The spears that knew the way to victory\u2014 \u201cThose fatal weapons, which, inur\u2019d to blood, In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain Against our foes, on this contended plain.\u201d He said; then seiz\u2019d a mighty spear, and threw; Which, wing\u2019d with fate, thro\u2019 Maeon\u2019s buckler flew, Pierc\u2019d all the brazen plates, and reach\u2019d his heart: He stagger\u2019d with intolerable smart."], "How does Aeneas find the tree with the golden bough?": [" But if so dire a love your soul invades, As twice below to view the trembling shades; If you so hard a toil will undertake, As twice to pass th\u2019 innavigable lake; Receive my counsel. In the neighb\u2019ring grove There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night Conceal the happy plant from human sight. One bough it bears; but wondrous to behold! The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold: This from the vulgar branches must be torn, And to fair Proserpine the present borne, Ere leave be giv\u2019n to tempt the nether skies. The first thus rent a second will arise, And the same metal the same room supplies. Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see The lurking gold upon the fatal tree: Then rend it off, as holy rites command; The willing metal will obey thy hand, Following with ease, if favour\u2019d by thy fate, Thou art foredoom\u2019d to view the Stygian state: If not, no labour can the tree constrain; And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain. Besides, you know not, while you here attend, Th\u2019 unworthy fate of your unhappy friend: Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, Depriv\u2019d of fun\u2019ral rites, pollutes your host. Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead, Two sable sheep around his hearse be led; Then, living turfs upon his body lay: This done, securely take the destin\u2019d way, To find the regions destitute of day.\u201d She said, and held her peace.", " Huge trunks of trees, fell\u2019d from the steepy crown Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down. Arm\u2019d like the rest the Trojan prince appears, And by his pious labour urges theirs. Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind The ways to compass what his wish design\u2019d, He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove, And then with vows implor\u2019d the Queen of Love: \u201cO may thy pow\u2019r, propitious still to me, Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree, In this deep forest; since the Sibyl\u2019s breath Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus\u2019 death.\u201d Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight, Two doves, descending from their airy flight, Secure upon the grassy plain alight. He knew his mother\u2019s birds; and thus he pray\u2019d: \u201cBe you my guides, with your auspicious aid, And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, Whose glitt\u2019ring shadow gilds the sacred ground. And thou, great parent, with celestial care, In this distress be present to my pray\u2019r!\u201d Thus having said, he stopp\u2019d with watchful sight, Observing still the motions of their flight, What course they took, what happy signs they shew. They fed, and, flutt\u2019ring, by degrees withdrew Still farther from the place, but still in view: Hopping and flying, thus they led him on To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun They wing\u2019d their flight aloft; then, stooping low, Perch\u2019d on the double tree that bears the golden bough. Thro\u2019 the green leafs the glitt\u2019ring shadows glow; As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe, Where the proud mother views her precious brood, And happier branches, which she never sow\u2019d.", " Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames His tardy troops, and, calling by their names, Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats To lay in ashes, if they dare supply With arms or aid his vanquish\u2019d enemy: Thus menacing, he still pursues the course, With vigour, tho\u2019 diminish\u2019d of his force. Ten times already round the listed place One chief had fled, and t\u2019 other giv\u2019n the chase: No trivial prize is play\u2019d; for on the life Or death of Turnus now depends the strife. Within the space, an olive tree had stood, A sacred shade, a venerable wood, For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins\u2019 guardian god. Here hung the vests, and tablets were engrav\u2019d, Of sinking mariners from shipwreck sav\u2019d. With heedless hands the Trojans fell\u2019d the tree, To make the ground enclos\u2019d for combat free. Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance, Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance; Then stoop\u2019d, and tugg\u2019d with force immense, to free Th\u2019 incumber\u2019d spear from the tenacious tree; That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain, His flying weapon might from far attain. Confus\u2019d with fear, bereft of human aid, Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray\u2019d: \u201cO Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth, Where I thy foster son receiv\u2019d my birth, Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand Your plant has honour\u2019d, which your foes profan\u2019d, Propitious hear my pious pray\u2019r!\u201d He said, Nor with successless vows invok\u2019d their aid.", " Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know Their process, or the forms of law below. Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along, And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung Unhappy Theseus, doom\u2019d for ever there, Is fix\u2019d by fate on his eternal chair; And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries (Could warning make the world more just or wise): \u2018Learn righteousness, and dread th\u2019 avenging deities.\u2019 To tyrants others have their country sold, Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold; Some have old laws repeal\u2019d, new statutes made, Not as the people pleas\u2019d, but as they paid; With incest some their daughters\u2019 bed profan\u2019d: All dar\u2019d the worst of ills, and, what they dar\u2019d, attain\u2019d. Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, And throats of brass, inspir\u2019d with iron lungs, I could not half those horrid crimes repeat, Nor half the punishments those crimes have met. But let us haste our voyage to pursue: The walls of Pluto\u2019s palace are in view; The gate, and iron arch above it, stands On anvils labour\u2019d by the Cyclops\u2019 hands. Before our farther way the Fates allow, Here must we fix on high the golden bough.\u201d She said, and thro\u2019 the gloomy shades they pass\u2019d, And chose the middle path.

The keeper charm\u2019d, the chief without delay Pass\u2019d on, and took th\u2019 irremeable way. Before the gates, the cries of babes new born, Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn, Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws Condemn\u2019d to die, when traitors judg\u2019d their cause. Nor want they lots, nor judges to review The wrongful sentence, and award a new. Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears; And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears. Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls, Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls. The next, in place and punishment, are they Who prodigally throw their souls away; Fools, who, repining at their wretched state, And loathing anxious life, suborn\u2019d their fate. With late repentance now they would retrieve The bodies they forsook, and wish to live; Their pains and poverty desire to bear, To view the light of heav\u2019n, and breathe the vital air: But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose, And with circling streams the captive souls inclose. Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear So call\u2019d from lovers that inhabit there. The souls whom that unhappy flame invades, In secret solitude and myrtle shades Make endless moans, and, pining with desire, Lament too late their unextinguish\u2019d fire. Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found, Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound Made by her son.", " Now is but death, or flight; disarm\u2019d he flies, When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies. Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join\u2019d, Hurrying to war, disorder\u2019d in his mind, Snatch\u2019d the first weapon which his haste could find. \u2019Twas not the fated sword his father bore, But that his charioteer Metiscus wore. This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held; But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield, The mortal-temper\u2019d steel deceiv\u2019d his hand: The shiver\u2019d fragments shone amid the sand. Surpris\u2019d with fear, he fled along the field, And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel\u2019d; For here the Trojan troops the list surround, And there the pass is clos\u2019d with pools and marshy ground. Aeneas hastens, tho\u2019 with heavier pace\u2014 His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase, And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse\u2014 Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues. Thus, when a fearful stag is clos\u2019d around With crimson toils, or in a river found, High on the bank the deep-mouth\u2019d hound appears, Still opening, following still, where\u2019er he steers; The persecuted creature, to and fro, Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe: Steep is th\u2019 ascent, and, if he gains the land, The purple death is pitch\u2019d along the strand. His eager foe, determin\u2019d to the chase, Stretch\u2019d at his length, gains ground at ev\u2019ry pace; Now to his beamy head he makes his way, And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey: Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear; He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air: The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries; The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.", " The hero, who beheld with wond\u2019ring eyes The tumult mix\u2019d with shrieks, laments, and cries, Ask\u2019d of his guide, what the rude concourse meant; Why to the shore the thronging people bent; What forms of law among the ghosts were us\u2019d; Why some were ferried o\u2019er, and some refus\u2019d. \u201cSon of Anchises, offspring of the gods,\u201d The Sibyl said, \u201cyou see the Stygian floods, The sacred stream which heav\u2019n\u2019s imperial state Attests in oaths, and fears to violate. The ghosts rejected are th\u2019 unhappy crew Depriv\u2019d of sepulchers and fun\u2019ral due: The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host, He ferries over to the farther coast; Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves With such whose bones are not compos\u2019d in graves. A hundred years they wander on the shore; At length, their penance done, are wafted o\u2019er.\u201d The Trojan chief his forward pace repress\u2019d, Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast, He saw his friends, who, whelm\u2019d beneath the waves, Their fun\u2019ral honours claim\u2019d, and ask\u2019d their quiet graves. The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew, And the brave leader of the Lycian crew, Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met; The sailors master\u2019d, and the ship o\u2019erset. Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press\u2019d, Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest, Who, while he steering view\u2019d the stars, and bore His course from Afric to the Latian shore, Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix\u2019d his view, And scarcely thro\u2019 the gloom the sullen shadow knew.", " The chief unsheath\u2019d his shining steel, prepar\u2019d, Tho\u2019 seiz\u2019d with sudden fear, to force the guard, Off\u2019ring his brandish\u2019d weapon at their face; Had not the Sibyl stopp\u2019d his eager pace, And told him what those empty phantoms were: Forms without bodies, and impassive air. Hence to deep Acheron they take their way, Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay, Are whirl\u2019d aloft, and in Cocytus lost. There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast: A sordid god: down from his hoary chin A length of beard descends, uncomb\u2019d, unclean; His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire; A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers; The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears. He look\u2019d in years; yet in his years were seen A youthful vigour and autumnal green. An airy crowd came rushing where he stood, Which fill\u2019d the margin of the fatal flood: Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids, And mighty heroes\u2019 more majestic shades, And youths, intomb\u2019d before their fathers\u2019 eyes, With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries. Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods, Or fowls, by winter forc\u2019d, forsake the floods, And wing their hasty flight to happier lands; Such, and so thick, the shiv\u2019ring army stands, And press for passage with extended hands. Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore: The rest he drove to distance from the shore."], "Who does Aeneas see in the Fields of Mourning?": [" He turn\u2019d, and held Against his threat\u2019ning foe his ample shield; Then call\u2019d for aid: but, while he cried in vain, The chariot bore him backward on the plain. He lies revers\u2019d; the victor king descends, And strikes so justly where his helmet ends, He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk. While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield, The wounded prince is forc\u2019d to leave the field: Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried, And young Ascanius, weeping by his side, Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear His limbs from earth, supported on his spear. Resolv\u2019d in mind, regardless of the smart, He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart. The steel remains. No readier way he found To draw the weapon, than t\u2019 inlarge the wound. Eager of fight, impatient of delay, He begs; and his unwilling friends obey. Iapis was at hand to prove his art, Whose blooming youth so fir\u2019d Apollo\u2019s heart, That, for his love, he proffer\u2019d to bestow His tuneful harp and his unerring bow. The pious youth, more studious how to save His aged sire, now sinking to the grave, Preferr\u2019d the pow\u2019r of plants, and silent praise Of healing arts, before Phoebean bays. Propp\u2019d on his lance the pensive hero stood, And heard and saw, unmov\u2019d, the mourning crowd. The fam\u2019d physician tucks his robes around With ready hands, and hastens to the wound. With gentle touches he performs his part, This way and that, soliciting the dart, And exercises all his heav\u2019nly art.", " Now follow cheerful to the trembling town; Press but an entrance, and presume it won. Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies, As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice. Turnus shall fall extended on the plain, And, in this omen, is already slain. Prepar\u2019d in arms, pursue your happy chance; That none unwarn\u2019d may plead his ignorance, And I, at Heav\u2019n\u2019s appointed hour, may find Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind. Meantime the rites and fun\u2019ral pomps prepare, Due to your dead companions of the war: The last respect the living can bestow, To shield their shadows from contempt below. That conquer\u2019d earth be theirs, for which they fought, And which for us with their own blood they bought; But first the corpse of our unhappy friend To the sad city of Evander send, Who, not inglorious, in his age\u2019s bloom, Was hurried hence by too severe a doom.\u201d Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay. Acoetes watch\u2019d the corpse; whose youth deserv\u2019d The father\u2019s trust; and now the son he serv\u2019d With equal faith, but less auspicious care. Th\u2019 attendants of the slain his sorrow share. A troop of Trojans mix\u2019d with these appear, And mourning matrons with dishevel\u2019d hair. Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky. They rear his drooping forehead from the ground; But, when Aeneas view\u2019d the grisly wound Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore, And the fair flesh distain\u2019d with purple gore; First, melting into tears, the pious man Deplor\u2019d so sad a sight, then thus began: \u201cUnhappy youth!", " Twelve days the term allow\u2019d: and, during those, Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes, Mix\u2019d in the woods, for fun\u2019ral piles prepare To fell the timber, and forget the war. Loud axes thro\u2019 the groaning groves resound; Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground; First fall from high; and some the trunks receive In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave. And now the fatal news by Fame is blown Thro\u2019 the short circuit of th\u2019 Arcadian town, Of Pallas slain\u2014by Fame, which just before His triumphs on distended pinions bore. Rushing from out the gate, the people stand, Each with a fun\u2019ral flambeau in his hand. Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze: The fields are lighten\u2019d with a fiery blaze, That cast a sullen splendour on their friends, The marching troop which their dead prince attends. Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, And their mix\u2019d mourning rends the vaulted sky. The town is fill\u2019d with tumult and with tears, Till the loud clamours reach Evander\u2019s ears: Forgetful of his state, he runs along, With a disorder\u2019d pace, and cleaves the throng; Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies, With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes. Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks: \u201cO Pallas! thou hast fail\u2019d thy plighted word, To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!", " The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force. Then Venulus to Diomede they send, To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, Declare the common danger, and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm: \u201cAeneas, landed on the Latian coast, With banish\u2019d gods, and with a baffled host, Yet now aspir\u2019d to conquest of the state, And claim\u2019d a title from the gods and fate; What num\u2019rous nations in his quarrel came, And how they spread his formidable name. What he design\u2019d, what mischief might arise, If fortune favour\u2019d his first enterprise, Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, And common interest, was involv\u2019d in theirs.\u201d While Turnus and th\u2019 allies thus urge the war, The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare."], "What future event does Anchises show Aeneas?": [" The heads of these with holy fillets bound, And all their temples were with garlands crown\u2019d. To these the Sibyl thus her speech address\u2019d, And first to him surrounded by the rest Tow\u2019ring his height, and ample was his breast; \u201cSay, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say, Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way To find the hero, for whose only sake We sought the dark abodes, and cross\u2019d the bitter lake?\u201d To this the sacred poet thus replied: \u201cIn no fix\u2019d place the happy souls reside. In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, By crystal streams, that murmur thro\u2019 the meads: But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; The path conducts you to your journey\u2019s end.\u201d This said, he led them up the mountain\u2019s brow, And shews them all the shining fields below. They wind the hill, and thro\u2019 the blissful meadows go. But old Anchises, in a flow\u2019ry vale, Review\u2019d his muster\u2019d race, and took the tale: Those happy spirits, which, ordain\u2019d by fate, For future beings and new bodies wait. With studious thought observ\u2019d th\u2019 illustrious throng, In nature\u2019s order as they pass\u2019d along: Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care, In peaceful senates and successful war. He, when Aeneas on the plain appears, Meets him with open arms, and falling tears. \u201cWelcome,\u201d he said, \u201cthe gods\u2019 undoubted race! O long expected to my dear embrace! Once more \u2019tis giv\u2019n me to behold your face! The love and pious duty which you pay Have pass\u2019d the perils of so hard a way.", " Ascanius this observ\u2019d, and smiling said: \u201cSee, we devour the plates on which we fed.\u201d The speech had omen, that the Trojan race Should find repose, and this the time and place. Aeneas took the word, and thus replies, Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes: \u201cAll hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods! Behold the destin\u2019d place of your abodes! For thus Anchises prophesied of old, And this our fatal place of rest foretold: \u2018When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat, By famine forc\u2019d, your trenchers you shall eat, Then ease your weary Trojans will attend, And the long labours of your voyage end. Remember on that happy coast to build, And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.\u2019 This was that famine, this the fatal place Which ends the wand\u2019ring of our exil\u2019d race. Then, on tomorrow\u2019s dawn, your care employ, To search the land, and where the cities lie, And what the men; but give this day to joy. Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest, Call great Anchises to the genial feast: Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught; Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought.\u201d Thus having said, the hero bound his brows With leafy branches, then perform\u2019d his vows; Adoring first the genius of the place, Then Earth, the mother of the heav\u2019nly race, The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown, And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne, And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove, And last his sire below, and mother queen above.", " Such Dido was; with such becoming state, Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great. Their labour to her future sway she speeds, And passing with a gracious glance proceeds; Then mounts the throne, high plac\u2019d before the shrine: In crowds around, the swarming people join. She takes petitions, and dispenses laws, Hears and determines ev\u2019ry private cause; Their tasks in equal portions she divides, And, where unequal, there by lots decides. Another way by chance Aeneas bends His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends, Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong, And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng, Whom late the tempest on the billows toss\u2019d, And widely scatter\u2019d on another coast. The prince, unseen, surpris\u2019d with wonder stands, And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands; But, doubtful of the wish\u2019d event, he stays, And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys, Impatient till they told their present state, And where they left their ships, and what their fate, And why they came, and what was their request; For these were sent, commission\u2019d by the rest, To sue for leave to land their sickly men, And gain admission to the gracious queen. Ent\u2019ring, with cries they fill\u2019d the holy fane; Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began: \u201cO Queen! indulg\u2019d by favour of the gods To found an empire in these new abodes, To build a town, with statutes to restrain The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign, We wretched Trojans, toss\u2019d on ev\u2019ry shore, From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.", " Portents and prodigies their souls amaz\u2019d; But most, when this stupendous pile was rais\u2019d: Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen, And thunders rattled thro\u2019 a sky serene. Dismay\u2019d, and fearful of some dire event, Eurypylus t\u2019 enquire their fate was sent. He from the gods this dreadful answer brought: \u201cO Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought, Your passage with a virgin\u2019s blood was bought: So must your safe return be bought again, And Grecian blood once more atone the main.\u201d The spreading rumour round the people ran; All fear\u2019d, and each believ\u2019d himself the man. Ulysses took th\u2019 advantage of their fright; Call\u2019d Calchas, and produc\u2019d in open sight: Then bade him name the wretch, ordain\u2019d by fate The public victim, to redeem the state. Already some presag\u2019d the dire event, And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant. For twice five days the good old seer withstood Th\u2019 intended treason, and was dumb to blood, Till, tir\u2019d, with endless clamours and pursuit Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute; But, as it was agreed, pronounc\u2019d that I Was destin\u2019d by the wrathful gods to die. All prais\u2019d the sentence, pleas\u2019d the storm should fall On one alone, whose fury threaten\u2019d all. The dismal day was come; the priests prepare Their leaven\u2019d cakes, and fillets for my hair. I follow\u2019d nature\u2019s laws, and must avow I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow. Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay, Secure of safety when they sail\u2019d away."], "Which river do the Trojans reach as they near Latium?": [" Call them not Trojans: perish the renown And name of Troy, with that detested town. Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign And Rome\u2019s immortal majesty remain.\u201d Then thus the founder of mankind replies (Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes) \u201cCan Saturn\u2019s issue, and heav\u2019n\u2019s other heir, Such endless anger in her bosom bear? Be mistress, and your full desires obtain; But quench the choler you foment in vain. From ancient blood th\u2019 Ausonian people sprung, Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue. The Trojans to their customs shall be tied: I will, myself, their common rites provide; The natives shall command, the foreigners subside. All shall be Latium; Troy without a name; And her lost sons forget from whence they came. From blood so mix\u2019d, a pious race shall flow, Equal to gods, excelling all below. No nation more respect to you shall pay, Or greater off\u2019rings on your altars lay.\u201d Juno consents, well pleas\u2019d that her desires Had found success, and from the cloud retires. The peace thus made, the Thund\u2019rer next prepares To force the wat\u2019ry goddess from the wars. Deep in the dismal regions void of light, Three daughters at a birth were born to Night: These their brown mother, brooding on her care, Indued with windy wings to flit in air, With serpents girt alike, and crown\u2019d with hissing hair. In heav\u2019n the Dirae call\u2019d, and still at hand, Before the throne of angry Jove they stand, His ministers of wrath, and ready still The minds of mortal men with fears to fill, Whene\u2019er the moody sire, to wreak his hate On realms or towns deserving of their fate, Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care, And terrifies the guilty world with war.", " Ilioneus made this reply: \u201cO king, of Faunus\u2019 royal family! Nor wintry winds to Latium forc\u2019d our way, Nor did the stars our wand\u2019ring course betray. Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound, The port, so long desir\u2019d, at length we found; From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell\u2019d; Great as the greatest that the sun beheld. The god began our line, who rules above; And, as our race, our king descends from Jove: And hither are we come, by his command, To crave admission in your happy land. How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour\u2019d, Our plains, our temples, and our town devour\u2019d; What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms Shook Asia\u2019s crown with European arms; Ev\u2019n such have heard, if any such there be, Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea; And such as, born beneath the burning sky And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie. From that dire deluge, thro\u2019 the wat\u2019ry waste, Such length of years, such various perils past, At last escap\u2019d, to Latium we repair, To beg what you without your want may spare: The common water, and the common air; Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes, Fit to receive and serve our banish\u2019d gods. Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace, Nor length of time our gratitude efface. Besides, what endless honour you shall gain, To save and shelter Troy\u2019s unhappy train! Now, by my sov\u2019reign, and his fate, I swear, Renown\u2019d for faith in peace, for force in war; Oft our alliance other lands desir\u2019d, And, what we seek of you, of us requir\u2019d.", " For you, my royal father, and my fame, I, Turnus, not the least of all my name, Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand, And I alone will answer his demand. Drances shall rest secure, and neither share The danger, nor divide the prize of war.\u201d While they debate, nor these nor those will yield, Aeneas draws his forces to the field, And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed Return, and thro\u2019 the frighted city spread Th\u2019 unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried, In battle marching by the river side, And bending to the town. They take th\u2019 alarm: Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. Th\u2019 impetuous youth press forward to the field; They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield: The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; Old feeble men with fainter groans reply; A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky, Like that of swans remurm\u2019ring to the floods, Or birds of diff\u2019ring kinds in hollow woods. Turnus th\u2019 occasion takes, and cries aloud: \u201cTalk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd: Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls, And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls.\u201d He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace, Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place: \u201cThou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band. Messapus and Catillus, post your force Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse. Some guard the passes, others man the wall; Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call.\u201d They swarm from ev\u2019ry quarter of the town, And with disorder\u2019d haste the rampires crown.", " Then water in his hollow palm he took From Tiber\u2019s flood, and thus the pow\u2019rs bespoke: \u201cLaurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed, And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep. Whatever fount, whatever holy deep, Conceals thy wat\u2019ry stores; where\u2019er they rise, And, bubbling from below, salute the skies; Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn, For this thy kind compassion of our woes, Shalt share my morning song and ev\u2019ning vows. But, O be present to thy people\u2019s aid, And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!\u201d Thus having said, two galleys from his stores, With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars. Now on the shore the fatal swine is found. Wond\u2019rous to tell!\u2014She lay along the ground: Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung; She white herself, and white her thirty young. Aeneas takes the mother and her brood, And all on Juno\u2019s altar are bestow\u2019d. The foll\u2019wing night, and the succeeding day, Propitious Tiber smooth\u2019d his wat\u2019ry way: He roll\u2019d his river back, and pois\u2019d he stood, A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore, Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. Shouts from the land give omen to their course, And the pitch\u2019d vessels glide with easy force. The woods and waters wonder at the gleam Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream."], "What is the significance of the Trojans' meal of bread and fruit?": [" To these the Latian and the Sabine land Fly, when distress\u2019d, and thence relief demand. The priest on skins of off\u2019rings takes his ease, And nightly visions in his slumber sees; A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears, And, flutt\u2019ring round his temples, deafs his ears: These he consults, the future fates to know, From pow\u2019rs above, and from the fiends below. Here, for the gods\u2019 advice, Latinus flies, Off\u2019ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice: Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir\u2019d, He laid beneath him, and to rest retir\u2019d. No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound, When, from above, a more than mortal sound Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke: \u201cSeek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke. A foreign son upon thy shore descends, Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends. His race, in arms and arts of peace renown\u2019d, Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound: \u2019Tis theirs whate\u2019er the sun surveys around.\u201d These answers, in the silent night receiv\u2019d, The king himself divulg\u2019d, the land believ\u2019d: The fame thro\u2019 all the neighb\u2019ring nations flew, When now the Trojan navy was in view. Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread His table on the turf, with cakes of bread; And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed. They sate; and, (not without the god\u2019s command,) Their homely fare dispatch\u2019d, the hungry band Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour, To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.", " and well he might require Achilles\u2019 car and horses, for his hire: But, met upon the scout, th\u2019 Aetolian prince In death bestow\u2019d a juster recompense. Fierce Turnus view\u2019d the Trojan from afar, And launch\u2019d his jav\u2019lin from his lofty car; Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow, And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, Wrench\u2019d from his feeble hold the shining sword, And plung\u2019d it in the bosom of its lord. \u201cPossess,\u201d said he, \u201cthe fruit of all thy pains, And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains. Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand; Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!\u201d Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew, Whom o\u2019er his neck his flound\u2019ring courser threw. As when loud Boreas, with his blust\u2019ring train, Stoops from above, incumbent on the main; Where\u2019er he flies, he drives the rack before, And rolls the billows on th\u2019 Aegaean shore: So, where resistless Turnus takes his course, The scatter\u2019d squadrons bend before his force; His crest of horses\u2019 hair is blown behind By adverse air, and rustles in the wind. This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain, And, as the chariot roll\u2019d along the plain, Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz\u2019d the rein. Thus hung in air, he still retain\u2019d his hold, The coursers frighted, and their course controll\u2019d.

She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep, Reclaim\u2019d his rage, and sooth\u2019d him into sleep. She watch\u2019d the golden fruit; her charms unbind The chains of love, or fix them on the mind: She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry, Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky. The yawning earth rebellows to her call, Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall. Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part, How loth I am to try this impious art!

Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac\u2019d, Where I my ruin in his arms embrac\u2019d: All relics of the wretch are doom\u2019d to fire; For so the priestess and her charms require.\u201d Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears; A mortal paleness in her face appears: Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find The secret fun\u2019ral in these rites design\u2019d; Nor thought so dire a rage possess\u2019d her mind. Unknowing of a train conceal\u2019d so well, She fear\u2019d no worse than when Sichaeus fell; Therefore obeys.

Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride, Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen\u2019d with a stride, In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied: \u201cTwice-conquer\u2019d cowards, now your shame is shown\u2014 Coop\u2019d up a second time within your town!

You shall not find the sons of Atreus here, Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear. Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood, We bear our newborn infants to the flood; There bath\u2019d amid the stream, our boys we hold, With winter harden\u2019d, and inur\u2019d to cold. They wake before the day to range the wood, Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer\u2019d food. No sports, but what belong to war, they know: To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow. Our youth, of labour patient, earn their bread; Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed. From plows and harrows sent to seek renown, They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town. No part of life from toils of war is free, No change in age, or diff\u2019rence in degree. We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel, Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel; Th\u2019 inverted lance makes furrows in the plain."], "What does Latinus offer Aeneas in addition to land?": [" Of various things discoursing as he pass\u2019d, Anchises hither bends his steps at last. Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn\u2019d to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII THE ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call\u2019d from thee, The nurse of great Aeneas\u2019 infancy. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia\u2019s plains; Thy name (\u2019tis all a ghost can have) remains. Now, when the prince her fun\u2019ral rites had paid, He plow\u2019d the Tyrrhene seas with sails display\u2019d. From land a gentle breeze arose by night, Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, And the sea trembled with her silver light. Now near the shelves of Circe\u2019s shores they run, (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) A dang\u2019rous coast: the goddess wastes her days In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, And cedar brands supply her father\u2019s light.", " Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear Two lions carv\u2019d, which rising Ida bear\u2014 Ida, to wand\u2019ring Trojans ever dear. Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate, Revolving war\u2019s events, and various fate. His left young Pallas kept, fix\u2019d to his side, And oft of winds enquir\u2019d, and of the tide; Oft of the stars, and of their wat\u2019ry way; And what he suffer\u2019d both by land and sea. Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring! The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing, Which follow\u2019d great Aeneas to the war: Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare. A thousand youths brave Massicus obey, Borne in the Tiger thro\u2019 the foaming sea; From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care: For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear. Fierce Abas next: his men bright armour wore; His stern Apollo\u2019s golden statue bore. Six hundred Populonia sent along, All skill\u2019d in martial exercise, and strong. Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins, An isle renown\u2019d for steel, and unexhausted mines. Asylas on his prow the third appears, Who heav\u2019n interprets, and the wand\u2019ring stars; From offer\u2019d entrails prodigies expounds, And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. A thousand spears in warlike order stand, Sent by the Pisans under his command. Fair Astur follows in the wat\u2019ry field, Proud of his manag\u2019d horse and painted shield. Gravisca, noisome from the neighb\u2019ring fen, And his own Caere, sent three hundred men; With those which Minio\u2019s fields and Pyrgi gave, All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave.", " The captain gives command; the joyful train Glide thro\u2019 the gloomy shade, and leave the main. Now, Erato, thy poet\u2019s mind inspire, And fill his soul with thy celestial fire! Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings; Declare the past and present state of things, When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought, And how the rivals lov\u2019d, and how they fought. These are my theme, and how the war began, And how concluded by the godlike man: For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage, Which princes and their people did engage; And haughty souls, that, mov\u2019d with mutual hate, In fighting fields pursued and found their fate; That rous\u2019d the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms, And peaceful Italy involv\u2019d in arms. A larger scene of action is display\u2019d; And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh\u2019d. Latinus, old and mild, had long possess\u2019d The Latin scepter, and his people blest: His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame His mother; fair Marica was her name. But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew His birth from Saturn, if records be true. Thus King Latinus, in the third degree, Had Saturn author of his family. But this old peaceful prince, as Heav\u2019n decreed, Was blest with no male issue to succeed: His sons in blooming youth were snatch\u2019d by fate; One only daughter heir\u2019d the royal state. Fir\u2019d with her love, and with ambition led, The neighb\u2019ring princes court her nuptial bed. Among the crowd, but far above the rest, Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address\u2019d.", " These are the crimes with which they load the name Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim: \u201cLet him who lords it o\u2019er th\u2019 Ausonian land Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand: His is the gain; our lot is but to serve; \u2019Tis just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve.\u201d This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite: \u201cHis foe expects, and dares him to the fight.\u201d Nor Turnus wants a party, to support His cause and credit in the Latian court. His former acts secure his present fame, And the queen shades him with her mighty name. While thus their factious minds with fury burn, The legates from th\u2019 Aetolian prince return: Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost And care employ\u2019d, their embassy is lost; That Diomedes refus\u2019d his aid in war, Unmov\u2019d with presents, and as deaf to pray\u2019r. Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought, Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought. Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late, A foreign son is pointed out by fate; And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed, The wrath of Heav\u2019n is hov\u2019ring o\u2019er his head. The gods, he saw, espous\u2019d the juster side, When late their titles in the field were tried: Witness the fresh laments, and fun\u2019ral tears undried. Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all The Latian senate to the council hall. The princes come, commanded by their head, And crowd the paths that to the palace lead. Supreme in pow\u2019r, and reverenc\u2019d for his years, He takes the throne, and in the midst appears."], "Who angers the natives against the Trojans?": [" Call them not Trojans: perish the renown And name of Troy, with that detested town. Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign And Rome\u2019s immortal majesty remain.\u201d Then thus the founder of mankind replies (Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes) \u201cCan Saturn\u2019s issue, and heav\u2019n\u2019s other heir, Such endless anger in her bosom bear? Be mistress, and your full desires obtain; But quench the choler you foment in vain. From ancient blood th\u2019 Ausonian people sprung, Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue. The Trojans to their customs shall be tied: I will, myself, their common rites provide; The natives shall command, the foreigners subside. All shall be Latium; Troy without a name; And her lost sons forget from whence they came. From blood so mix\u2019d, a pious race shall flow, Equal to gods, excelling all below. No nation more respect to you shall pay, Or greater off\u2019rings on your altars lay.\u201d Juno consents, well pleas\u2019d that her desires Had found success, and from the cloud retires. The peace thus made, the Thund\u2019rer next prepares To force the wat\u2019ry goddess from the wars. Deep in the dismal regions void of light, Three daughters at a birth were born to Night: These their brown mother, brooding on her care, Indued with windy wings to flit in air, With serpents girt alike, and crown\u2019d with hissing hair. In heav\u2019n the Dirae call\u2019d, and still at hand, Before the throne of angry Jove they stand, His ministers of wrath, and ready still The minds of mortal men with fears to fill, Whene\u2019er the moody sire, to wreak his hate On realms or towns deserving of their fate, Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care, And terrifies the guilty world with war.", " Then heav\u2019n\u2019s high monarch thunder\u2019d thrice aloud, And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud. Soon thro\u2019 the joyful camp a rumour flew, The time was come their city to renew. Then ev\u2019ry brow with cheerful green is crown\u2019d, The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round. When next the rosy morn disclos\u2019d the day, The scouts to sev\u2019ral parts divide their way, To learn the natives\u2019 names, their towns explore, The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore: Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands; Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands. The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways To found his empire, and his town to raise, A hundred youths from all his train selects, And to the Latian court their course directs, (The spacious palace where their prince resides,) And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides. They go commission\u2019d to require a peace, And carry presents to procure access. Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs His new-elected seat, and draws the lines. The Trojans round the place a rampire cast, And palisades about the trenches plac\u2019d. Meantime the train, proceeding on their way, From far the town and lofty tow\u2019rs survey; At length approach the walls. Without the gate, They see the boys and Latian youth debate The martial prizes on the dusty plain: Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein; Some bend the stubborn bow for victory, And some with darts their active sinews try.", " BOOK X THE ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\u201d Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large: \u201cO pow\u2019r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else protection can we fly?)", " \u2019Twas he, the noble Claudian race begot, The Claudian race, ordain\u2019d, in times to come, To share the greatness of imperial Rome. He led the Cures forth, of old renown, Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town, And all th\u2019 Eretian pow\u2019rs; besides a band That follow\u2019d from Velinum\u2019s dewy land, And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame, And mountaineers, that from Severus came, And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica, And those where yellow Tiber takes his way, And where Himella\u2019s wanton waters play. Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli: The warlike aids of Horta next appear, And the cold Nursians come to close the rear, Mix\u2019d with the natives born of Latine blood, Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood. Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main, When pale Orion sets in wintry rain; Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise, Or Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies, Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around; Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground. High in his chariot then Halesus came, A foe by birth to Troy\u2019s unhappy name: From Agamemnon born\u2014to Turnus\u2019 aid A thousand men the youthful hero led, Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown\u2019d, And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground, And those who live by Sidicinian shores, And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars, Cales\u2019 and Osca\u2019s old inhabitants, And rough Saticulans, inur\u2019d to wants: Light demi-lances from afar they throw, Fasten\u2019d with leathern thongs, to gall the foe."], "How does Ascanius inadvertently start the war?": [" The steel thro\u2019 both his temples forc\u2019d the way: Extended on the ground, Numanus lay. \u201cGo now, vain boaster, and true valour scorn! The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.\u201d Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake The heav\u2019ns with shouting, and new vigour take. Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud: \u201cAdvance, illustrious youth, increase in fame, And wide from east to west extend thy name; Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe To thee a race of demigods below. This is the way to heav\u2019n: the pow\u2019rs divine From this beginning date the Julian line. To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, The conquer\u2019d war is due, and the vast world is theirs. Troy is too narrow for thy name.\u201d He said, And plunging downward shot his radiant head; Dispell\u2019d the breathing air, that broke his flight: Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. Old Butes\u2019 form he took, Anchises\u2019 squire, Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: \u201cSuffice it thee, thy father\u2019s worthy son, The warlike prize thou hast already won. The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. Now tempt the war no more.\u201d He said, and flew Obscure in air, and vanish\u2019d from their view.", " They fled for fear; with these, he chas\u2019d along Camers the yellow-lock\u2019d, and Numa strong; Both great in arms, and both were fair and young. Camers was son to Volscens lately slain, In wealth surpassing all the Latian train, And in Amycla fix\u2019d his silent easy reign. And, as Aegaeon, when with heav\u2019n he strove, Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove; Mov\u2019d all his hundred hands, provok\u2019d the war, Defied the forky lightning from afar; At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires, And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires; In his right hand as many swords he wields, And takes the thunder on as many shields: With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood; And soon the fields with falling corps were strow\u2019d, When once his falchion found the taste of blood. With fury scarce to be conceiv\u2019d, he flew Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew. They, when they see the fiery chief advance, And pushing at their chests his pointed lance, Wheel\u2019d with so swift a motion, mad with fear, They threw their master headlong from the chair. They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before They bear the bounding chariot to the shore. Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains, With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins, And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains: Bold brethren both. The former wav\u2019d in air His flaming sword: Aeneas couch\u2019d his spear, Unus\u2019d to threats, and more unus\u2019d to fear. Then Liger thus: \u201cThy confidence is vain To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain: Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode, Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode; Nor Venus\u2019 veil is here, near Neptune\u2019s shield; Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field.\u201d Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer Return\u2019d his answer with his flying spear.", " Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race, In the great Centaur took the leading place; Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood, From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood. Far in the sea, against the foaming shore, There stands a rock: the raging billows roar Above his head in storms; but, when \u2019tis clear, Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear. In peace below the gentle waters run; The cormorants above lie basking in the sun. On this the hero fix\u2019d an oak in sight, The mark to guide the mariners aright. To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars; Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores. The lots decide their place. Above the rest, Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest; The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows: Besmear\u2019d with oil, their naked shoulders shine. All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign: They gripe their oars; and ev\u2019ry panting breast Is rais\u2019d by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress\u2019d. The clangour of the trumpet gives the sign; At once they start, advancing in a line: With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies; Lash\u2019d with their oars, the smoky billows rise; Sparkles the briny main, and the vex\u2019d ocean fries. Exact in time, with equal strokes they row: At once the brushing oars and brazen prow Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below. Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race, Invade the field with half so swift a pace; Not the fierce driver with more fury lends The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends, Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.", " Imperial sway no more exalts my mind; (Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav\u2019n was kind;) Now let my happier foes possess my place, Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race; And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace. Since you can spare, from all your wide command, No spot of earth, no hospitable land, Which may my wand\u2019ring fugitives receive; (Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;) Then, father, (if I still may use that name,) By ruin\u2019d Troy, yet smoking from the flame, I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care, Be freed from danger, and dismiss\u2019d the war: Inglorious let him live, without a crown. The father may be cast on coasts unknown, Struggling with fate; but let me save the son. Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow\u2019rs: In those recesses, and those sacred bow\u2019rs, Obscurely let him rest; his right resign To promis\u2019d empire, and his Julian line. Then Carthage may th\u2019 Ausonian towns destroy, Nor fear the race of a rejected boy. What profits it my son to scape the fire, Arm\u2019d with his gods, and loaded with his sire; To pass the perils of the seas and wind; Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind; To reach th\u2019 Italian shores; if, after all, Our second Pergamus is doom\u2019d to fall? Much better had he curb\u2019d his high desires, And hover\u2019d o\u2019er his ill-extinguish\u2019d fires.

In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore. O mortals, blind in fate, who never know To bear high fortune, or endure the low! The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain, Shall wish untouch\u2019d the trophies of the slain; Shall wish the fatal belt were far away, And curse the dire remembrance of the day.

The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed, Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed; Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides The goring rowels in his bleeding sides. \u201cVain fool, and coward!\u201d cries the lofty maid, \u201cCaught in the train which thou thyself hast laid! On others practice thy Ligurian arts; Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire, With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire.\u201d At this, so fast her flying feet she sped, That soon she strain\u2019d beyond his horse\u2019s head: Then turning short, at once she seiz\u2019d the rein, And laid the boaster grov\u2019ling on the plain. Not with more ease the falcon, from above, Trusses in middle air the trembling dove, Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound: The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground. Now mighty Jove, from his superior height, With his broad eye surveys th\u2019 unequal fight. He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain, And sends him to redeem th\u2019 abandon\u2019d plain.

Shall such affronts as these alone inflame The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name? My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife, And final ruin, for a ravish\u2019d wife. Was \u2019t not enough, that, punish\u2019d for the crime, They fell; but will they fall a second time? One would have thought they paid enough before, To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more. Can they securely trust their feeble wall, A slight partition, a thin interval, Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho\u2019 built By hands divine, yet perish\u2019d by their guilt? Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands, To force from out their lines these dastard bands. Less than a thousand ships will end this war, Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.

Discoursing thus together, they resort Where poor Evander kept his country court. They view\u2019d the ground of Rome\u2019s litigious hall; (Once oxen low\u2019d, where now the lawyers bawl;) Then, stooping, thro\u2019 the narrow gate they press\u2019d, When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest: \u201cMean as it is, this palace, and this door, Receiv\u2019d Alcides, then a conqueror. Dare to be poor; accept our homely food, Which feasted him, and emulate a god.\u201d Then underneath a lowly roof he led The weary prince, and laid him on a bed; The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o\u2019erspread.

Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force.

They view\u2019d the ground of Rome\u2019s litigious hall; (Once oxen low\u2019d, where now the lawyers bawl;) Then, stooping, thro\u2019 the narrow gate they press\u2019d, When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest: \u201cMean as it is, this palace, and this door, Receiv\u2019d Alcides, then a conqueror. Dare to be poor; accept our homely food, Which feasted him, and emulate a god.\u201d Then underneath a lowly roof he led The weary prince, and laid him on a bed; The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o\u2019erspread. Now night had shed her silver dews around, And with her sable wings embrac\u2019d the ground, When love\u2019s fair goddess, anxious for her son, (New tumults rising, and new wars begun,) Couch\u2019d with her husband in his golden bed, With these alluring words invokes his aid; And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move, Inspires each accent with the charms of love: \u201cWhile cruel fate conspir\u2019d with Grecian pow\u2019rs, To level with the ground the Trojan tow\u2019rs, I ask\u2019d not aid th\u2019 unhappy to restore, Nor did the succour of thy skill implore; Nor urg\u2019d the labours of my lord in vain, A sinking empire longer to sustain, Tho\u2019 much I ow\u2019d to Priam\u2019s house, and more The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.", " Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late, The gath\u2019ring storm just breaking on the state, Dismiss\u2019d the council till a fitter time, And own\u2019d his easy temper as his crime, Who, forc\u2019d against his reason, had complied To break the treaty for the promis\u2019d bride. Some help to sink new trenches; others aid To ram the stones, or raise the palisade. Hoarse trumpets sound th\u2019 alarm; around the walls Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labour calls. A sad procession in the streets is seen, Of matrons, that attend the mother queen: High in her chair she sits, and, at her side, With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride. They mount the cliff, where Pallas\u2019 temple stands; Pray\u2019rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands, With censers first they fume the sacred shrine, Then in this common supplication join: \u201cO patroness of arms, unspotted maid, Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid! Break short the pirate\u2019s lance; pronounce his fate, And lay the Phrygian low before the gate.\u201d Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast Well-temper\u2019d steel and scaly brass invest: The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold Are mingled metal damask\u2019d o\u2019er with gold. His faithful falchion sits upon his side; Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide: But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends, With godlike grace, he from the tow\u2019r descends. Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare His absent rival, and to promise war."], "Which god turned Italy from a land of savages into a nation?": [" Did god or man your fav\u2019rite son advise, With war unhop\u2019d the Latians to surprise? By fate, you boast, and by the gods\u2019 decree, He left his native land for Italy! Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more Than Heav\u2019n inspir\u2019d, he sought a foreign shore! Did I persuade to trust his second Troy To the raw conduct of a beardless boy, With walls unfinish\u2019d, which himself forsakes, And thro\u2019 the waves a wand\u2019ring voyage takes? When have I urg\u2019d him meanly to demand The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land? Did I or Iris give this mad advice, Or made the fool himself the fatal choice? You think it hard, the Latians should destroy With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy! Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw Their native air, nor take a foreign law! That Turnus is permitted still to live, To whom his birth a god and goddess give! But yet is just and lawful for your line To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join; Realms, not your own, among your clans divide, And from the bridegroom tear the promis\u2019d bride; Petition, while you public arms prepare; Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war! \u2019Twas giv\u2019n to you, your darling son to shroud, To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd, And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud. From flaming fleets you turn\u2019d the fire away, And chang\u2019d the ships to daughters of the sea. But is my crime\u2014the Queen of Heav\u2019n offends, If she presume to save her suff\u2019ring friends!", " Again my father bids me seek the shore Of sacred Delos, and the god implore, To learn what end of woes we might expect, And to what clime our weary course direct. \u201c\u2019Twas night, when ev\u2019ry creature, void of cares, The common gift of balmy slumber shares: The statues of my gods (for such they seem\u2019d), Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem\u2019d, Before me stood, majestically bright, Full in the beams of Phoebe\u2019s ent\u2019ring light. Then thus they spoke, and eas\u2019d my troubled mind: \u2018What from the Delian god thou go\u2019st to find, He tells thee here, and sends us to relate. Those pow\u2019rs are we, companions of thy fate, Who from the burning town by thee were brought, Thy fortune follow\u2019d, and thy safety wrought. Thro\u2019 seas and lands as we thy steps attend, So shall our care thy glorious race befriend. An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain, A town that o\u2019er the conquer\u2019d world shall reign. Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build; Nor let thy weary mind to labours yield: But change thy seat; for not the Delian god, Nor we, have giv\u2019n thee Crete for our abode. A land there is, Hesperia call\u2019d of old, The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold. Th\u2019 Oenotrians held it once, by later fame Now call\u2019d Italia, from the leader\u2019s name. Jasius there and Dardanus were born; From thence we came, and thither must return. Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet. Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.\u2019 \u201cAstonish\u2019d at their voices and their sight, (Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night; I saw, I knew their faces, and descried, In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;) I started from my couch; a clammy sweat On all my limbs and shiv\u2019ring body sate.", " Thus chang\u2019d, amidst the crying crowd she ran, Mix\u2019d with the matrons, and these words began: \u201cO wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow\u2019r, Nor flames, destroy\u2019d, in Troy\u2019s unhappy hour! O wretched we, reserv\u2019d by cruel fate, Beyond the ruins of the sinking state! Now sev\u2019n revolving years are wholly run, Since this improsp\u2019rous voyage we begun; Since, toss\u2019d from shores to shores, from lands to lands, Inhospitable rocks and barren sands, Wand\u2019ring in exile thro\u2019 the stormy sea, We search in vain for flying Italy. Now cast by fortune on this kindred land, What should our rest and rising walls withstand, Or hinder here to fix our banish\u2019d band? O country lost, and gods redeem\u2019d in vain, If still in endless exile we remain! Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew, Or streams of some dissembled Simois view! Haste, join with me, th\u2019 unhappy fleet consume! Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom. In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands (For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands: \u2018With these,\u2019 said she, \u2018these wand\u2019ring ships destroy: These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.\u2019 Time calls you now; the precious hour employ: Slack not the good presage, while Heav\u2019n inspires Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires. See! Neptune\u2019s altars minister their brands: The god is pleas\u2019d; the god supplies our hands.\u201d Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew, And, toss\u2019d in air, amidst the galleys threw.", " Now all things to their utmost issue tend, Push\u2019d by the Fates to their appointed end. While leave was giv\u2019n thee, and a lawful hour For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow\u2019r, Toss\u2019d on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress, And, driv\u2019n ashore, with hostile arms oppress; Deform the royal house; and, from the side Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride: Now cease at my command.\u201d The Thund\u2019rer said; And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made: \u201cBecause your dread decree too well I knew, From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew. Else should you not behold me here, alone, Involv\u2019d in empty clouds, my friends bemoan, But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight Engag\u2019d against my foes in mortal fight. \u2019Tis true, Juturna mingled in the strife By my command, to save her brother\u2019s life, At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake, (The most religious oath the gods can take,) With this restriction, not to bend the bow, Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw. And now, resign\u2019d to your superior might, And tir\u2019d with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight. This let me beg (and this no fates withstand) Both for myself and for your father\u2019s land, That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace, (Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,) The laws of either nation be the same; But let the Latins still retain their name, Speak the same language which they spoke before, Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore."], "What does Vulcan begin making for Aeneas?": [" Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste, Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass\u2019d. Scarce had he reach\u2019d the prow: Saturnia\u2019s hand The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land. With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea, And measures back with speed her former way. Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe, And sends his slaughter\u2019d troops to shades below. The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, And flew sublime, and vanish\u2019d in a cloud. Too late young Turnus the delusion found, Far on the sea, still making from the ground. Then, thankless for a life redeem\u2019d by shame, With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame, Fearful besides of what in fight had pass\u2019d, His hands and haggard eyes to heav\u2019n he cast; \u201cO Jove!\u201d he cried, \u201cfor what offence have I Deserv\u2019d to bear this endless infamy? Whence am I forc\u2019d, and whether am I borne? How, and with what reproach, shall I return? Shall ever I behold the Latian plain, Or see Laurentum\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs again? What will they say of their deserting chief The war was mine: I fly from their relief; I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave; And ev\u2019n from hence their dying groans receive. Here, overmatch\u2019d in fight, in heaps they lie; There, scatter\u2019d o\u2019er the fields, ignobly fly. Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive! Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve! On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive; Or set me shipwreck\u2019d on some desert shore, Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more, Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame, Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.\u201d Thus Turnus rav\u2019d, and various fates revolv\u2019d: The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv\u2019d.", " The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity.

Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force.

Turnus takes advantage of Aeneas\u2019s absence, fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea nymphs,) and assaults his camp.

The rear so press\u2019d the front, they could not wield Their angry weapons, to dispute the field. Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: Of equal youth and beauty both appear, But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air. Their congress in the field great Jove withstands: Both doom\u2019d to fall, but fall by greater hands. Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief Of Lausus\u2019 danger, urging swift relief. With his driv\u2019n chariot he divides the crowd, And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud: \u201cLet none presume his needless aid to join; Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: To this right hand is Pallas only due; O were his father here, my just revenge to view!\u201d From the forbidden space his men retir\u2019d. Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir\u2019d; Survey\u2019d him o\u2019er and o\u2019er with wond\u2019ring sight, Struck with his haughty mien, and tow\u2019ring height. Then to the king: \u201cYour empty vaunts forbear; Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear; Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name; Jove is impartial, and to both the same.\u201d He said, and to the void advanc\u2019d his pace: Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face. Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light, Address\u2019d himself on foot to single fight. And, as a lion\u2014when he spies from far A bull that seems to meditate the war, Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand\u2014 Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand: Imagine eager Turnus not more slow, To rush from high on his unequal foe."], "What is depicted on the shield Venus brings to Aeneas?": [" The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations.

The rustic honours of the scythe and share Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war. Old falchions are new temper\u2019d in the fires; The sounding trumpet ev\u2019ry soul inspires. The word is giv\u2019n; with eager speed they lace The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace. The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied; The trusty weapon sits on ev\u2019ry side. And now the mighty labour is begun Ye Muses, open all your Helicon. Sing you the chiefs that sway\u2019d th\u2019 Ausonian land, Their arms, and armies under their command; What warriors in our ancient clime were bred; What soldiers follow\u2019d, and what heroes led. For well you know, and can record alone, What fame to future times conveys but darkly down. Mezentius first appear\u2019d upon the plain: Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain, Defying earth and heav\u2019n. Etruria lost, He brings to Turnus\u2019 aid his baffled host. The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire, Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire; To Turnus only second in the grace Of manly mien, and features of the face. A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred, With fates averse a thousand men he led: His sire unworthy of so brave a son; Himself well worthy of a happier throne. Next Aventinus drives his chariot round The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown\u2019d.", " The bowstring touch\u2019d her breast, so strong she drew; Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew. At once the twanging bow and sounding dart The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart. Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death, His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath. The conqu\u2019ring damsel, with expanded wings, The welcome message to her mistress brings. Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field, And, unsustain\u2019d, the chiefs of Turnus yield. The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly, More on their speed than on their strength rely. Confus\u2019d in flight, they bear each other down, And spur their horses headlong to the town. Driv\u2019n by their foes, and to their fears resign\u2019d, Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind. These drop the shield, and those the lance forego, Or on their shoulders bear the slacken\u2019d bow. The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound, Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground. Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky, And o\u2019er the darken\u2019d walls and rampires fly. The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands, Rend heav\u2019n with female shrieks, and wring their hands. All pressing on, pursuers and pursued, Are crush\u2019d in crowds, a mingled multitude. Some happy few escape: the throng too late Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate. Ev\u2019n in the sight of home, the wretched sire Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire."], "Why does Jupiter call a council of the gods?": [" BOOK X THE ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\u201d Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large: \u201cO pow\u2019r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else protection can we fly?)", " The guard reliev\u2019d, the gen\u2019rous couple went To find the council at the royal tent. All creatures else forgot their daily care, And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate In nightly council for th\u2019 indanger\u2019d state. They vote a message to their absent chief, Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief. Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, Remote from clamour, and secure from foes. On their left arms their ample shields they bear, The right reclin\u2019d upon the bending spear. Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, And beg admission, eager to be heard: Th\u2019 affair important, not to be deferr\u2019d. Ascanius bids \u2019em be conducted in, Ord\u2019ring the more experienc\u2019d to begin. Then Nisus thus: \u201cYe fathers, lend your ears; Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. The foe, securely drench\u2019d in sleep and wine, Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; And where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies, Cov\u2019ring the plain, and curling to the skies, Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, Close by the sea, a passage we have spied, Which will our way to great Aeneas guide. Expect each hour to see him safe again, Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. Snatch we the lucky minute while we may; Nor can we be mistaken in the way; For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen The rising turrets, and the stream between, And know the winding course, with ev\u2019ry ford.\u201d He ceas\u2019d; and old Alethes took the word: \u201cOur country gods, in whom our trust we place, Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race, While we behold such dauntless worth appear In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.\u201d Then into tears of joy the father broke; Each in his longing arms by turns he took; Panted and paus\u2019d; and thus again he spoke: \u201cYe brave young men, what equal gifts can we, In recompense of such desert, decree?", " We met in fight; I know him, to my cost: With what a whirling force his lance he toss\u2019d! Heav\u2019ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw! How high he held his shield, and rose at ev\u2019ry blow! Had Troy produc\u2019d two more his match in might, They would have chang\u2019d the fortune of the fight: Th\u2019 invasion of the Greeks had been return\u2019d, Our empire wasted, and our cities burn\u2019d. The long defence the Trojan people made, The war protracted, and the siege delay\u2019d, Were due to Hector\u2019s and this hero\u2019s hand: Both brave alike, and equal in command; Aeneas, not inferior in the field, In pious reverence to the gods excell\u2019d. Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care Th\u2019 impending dangers of a fatal war.\u2019 He said no more; but, with this cold excuse, Refus\u2019d th\u2019 alliance, and advis\u2019d a truce.\u201d Thus Venulus concluded his report. A jarring murmur fill\u2019d the factious court: As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force, And dashes o\u2019er the stones that stop the course, The flood, constrain\u2019d within a scanty space, Roars horrible along th\u2019 uneasy race; White foam in gath\u2019ring eddies floats around; The rocky shores rebellow to the sound. The murmur ceas\u2019d: then from his lofty throne The king invok\u2019d the gods, and thus begun: \u201cI wish, ye Latins, what we now debate Had been resolv\u2019d before it was too late. Much better had it been for you and me, Unforc\u2019d by this our last necessity, To have been earlier wise, than now to call A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AENEID *** Produced by Anonymous Volunteers and David Widger THE AENEID by Virgil Translated by John Dryden Contents BOOK I BOOK II BOOK III BOOK IV BOOK V BOOK VI BOOK VII BOOK VIII BOOK IX BOOK X BOOK XI BOOK XII BOOK I THE ARGUMENT. The Trojans, after a seven years\u2019 voyage, set sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Aeolus raises at the request of Juno. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune drives off the winds, and calms the sea. Aeneas, with his own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her son\u2019s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians. Aeneas, going out to discover the country, meets his mother in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by device of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some discourse with him, desires the history of his adventures since the siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following books. Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc\u2019d by fate, And haughty Juno\u2019s unrelenting hate, Expell\u2019d and exil\u2019d, left the Trojan shore. Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore, And in the doubtful war, before he won The Latian realm, and built the destin\u2019d town; His banish\u2019d gods restor\u2019d to rites divine, And settled sure succession in his line, From whence the race of Alban fathers come, And the long glories of majestic Rome."], "Who helps Aeneas's new fleet return to battle quickly?": [" Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize, Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories? The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought, The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought. Go now, deluded man, and seek again New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain. Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize; Protect the Latians in luxurious ease. This dream all-pow\u2019rful Juno sends; I bear Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear. Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain; With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train: Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie In Tiber\u2019s mouth, with fire and sword destroy. The Latian king, unless he shall submit, Own his old promise, and his new forget; Let him, in arms, the pow\u2019r of Turnus prove, And learn to fear whom he disdains to love. For such is Heav\u2019n\u2019s command.\u201d The youthful prince With scorn replied, and made this bold defence: \u201cYou tell me, mother, what I knew before: The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore. I neither fear nor will provoke the war; My fate is Juno\u2019s most peculiar care. But time has made you dote, and vainly tell Of arms imagin\u2019d in your lonely cell. Go; be the temple and the gods your care; Permit to men the thought of peace and war.\u201d These haughty words Alecto\u2019s rage provoke, And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke. Her eyes grow stiffen\u2019d, and with sulphur burn; Her hideous looks and hellish form return; Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place, And open all the furies of her face: Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes, She cast him backward as he strove to rise, And, ling\u2019ring, sought to frame some new replies.", " If neither Jove\u2019s nor Fate\u2019s decree withstand, Secure his passage to the Latian land.\u201d Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main: \u201cWhat may not Venus hope from Neptune\u2019s reign? My kingdom claims your birth; my late defence Of your indanger\u2019d fleet may claim your confidence. Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare How much your lov\u2019d Aeneas is my care. Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest. Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press\u2019d, And drove before him headlong on the plain, And dash\u2019d against the walls the trembling train; When floods were fill\u2019d with bodies of the slain; When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way, Stood up on ridges to behold the sea; New heaps came tumbling in, and chok\u2019d his way; When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds Of force unequal, and unequal gods; I spread a cloud before the victor\u2019s sight, Sustain\u2019d the vanquish\u2019d, and secur\u2019d his flight; Ev\u2019n then secur\u2019d him, when I sought with joy The vow\u2019d destruction of ungrateful Troy. My will\u2019s the same: fair goddess, fear no more, Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore; Their lives are giv\u2019n; one destin\u2019d head alone Shall perish, and for multitudes atone.\u201d Thus having arm\u2019d with hopes her anxious mind, His finny team Saturnian Neptune join\u2019d, Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws, And to the loosen\u2019d reins permits the laws. High on the waves his azure car he guides; Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides, And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.", " They seize a fleet, which ready rigg\u2019d they find; Nor is Pygmalion\u2019s treasure left behind. The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea With prosp\u2019rous winds; a woman leads the way. I know not, if by stress of weather driv\u2019n, Or was their fatal course dispos\u2019d by Heav\u2019n; At last they landed, where from far your eyes May view the turrets of new Carthage rise; There bought a space of ground, which Byrsa call\u2019d, From the bull\u2019s hide, they first inclos\u2019d, and wall\u2019d. But whence are you? what country claims your birth? What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?\u201d To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes, And deeply sighing, thus her son replies: \u201cCould you with patience hear, or I relate, O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate! Thro\u2019 such a train of woes if I should run, The day would sooner than the tale be done! From ancient Troy, by force expell\u2019d, we came, If you by chance have heard the Trojan name. On various seas by various tempests toss\u2019d, At length we landed on your Libyan coast. The good Aeneas am I call\u2019d, a name, While Fortune favour\u2019d, not unknown to fame. My household gods, companions of my woes, With pious care I rescued from our foes. To fruitful Italy my course was bent; And from the King of Heav\u2019n is my descent. With twice ten sail I cross\u2019d the Phrygian sea; Fate and my mother goddess led my way. Scarce sev\u2019n, the thin remainders of my fleet, From storms preserv\u2019d, within your harbour meet.", " BOOK X THE ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\u201d Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large: \u201cO pow\u2019r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else protection can we fly?)"], "What does Aeneas do when he learns of Pallas's death?": [" Now follow cheerful to the trembling town; Press but an entrance, and presume it won. Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies, As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice. Turnus shall fall extended on the plain, And, in this omen, is already slain. Prepar\u2019d in arms, pursue your happy chance; That none unwarn\u2019d may plead his ignorance, And I, at Heav\u2019n\u2019s appointed hour, may find Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind. Meantime the rites and fun\u2019ral pomps prepare, Due to your dead companions of the war: The last respect the living can bestow, To shield their shadows from contempt below. That conquer\u2019d earth be theirs, for which they fought, And which for us with their own blood they bought; But first the corpse of our unhappy friend To the sad city of Evander send, Who, not inglorious, in his age\u2019s bloom, Was hurried hence by too severe a doom.\u201d Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay. Acoetes watch\u2019d the corpse; whose youth deserv\u2019d The father\u2019s trust; and now the son he serv\u2019d With equal faith, but less auspicious care. Th\u2019 attendants of the slain his sorrow share. A troop of Trojans mix\u2019d with these appear, And mourning matrons with dishevel\u2019d hair. Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky. They rear his drooping forehead from the ground; But, when Aeneas view\u2019d the grisly wound Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore, And the fair flesh distain\u2019d with purple gore; First, melting into tears, the pious man Deplor\u2019d so sad a sight, then thus began: \u201cUnhappy youth!", " Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, Whose mighty trunk had better grac\u2019d the wood, If Pallas had arriv\u2019d, with equal length Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd\u2019st in vain? Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, And, after Pallas\u2019 death, live ling\u2019ring on, \u2019Tis to behold his vengeance for my son. I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead. My son and I expect it from his hand; \u2019Tis all that he can give, or we demand. Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, To greet my Pallas with such news below.\u201d The morn had now dispell\u2019d the shades of night, Restoring toils, when she restor\u2019d the light. The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command To raise the piles along the winding strand. Their friends convey the dead fun\u2019ral fires; Black smould\u2019ring smoke from the green wood expires; The light of heav\u2019n is chok\u2019d, and the new day retires. Then thrice around the kindled piles they go (For ancient custom had ordain\u2019d it so) Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw The spoils, in battle taken from the foe: Helms, bits emboss\u2019d, and swords of shining steel; One casts a target, one a chariot wheel; Some to their fellows their own arms restore: The falchions which in luckless fight they bore, Their bucklers pierc\u2019d, their darts bestow\u2019d in vain, And shiver\u2019d lances gather\u2019d from the plain.", " To the rude shock of war both armies came; Their leaders equal, and their strength the same. The rear so press\u2019d the front, they could not wield Their angry weapons, to dispute the field. Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: Of equal youth and beauty both appear, But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air. Their congress in the field great Jove withstands: Both doom\u2019d to fall, but fall by greater hands. Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief Of Lausus\u2019 danger, urging swift relief. With his driv\u2019n chariot he divides the crowd, And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud: \u201cLet none presume his needless aid to join; Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: To this right hand is Pallas only due; O were his father here, my just revenge to view!\u201d From the forbidden space his men retir\u2019d. Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir\u2019d; Survey\u2019d him o\u2019er and o\u2019er with wond\u2019ring sight, Struck with his haughty mien, and tow\u2019ring height. Then to the king: \u201cYour empty vaunts forbear; Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear; Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name; Jove is impartial, and to both the same.\u201d He said, and to the void advanc\u2019d his pace: Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face. Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light, Address\u2019d himself on foot to single fight. And, as a lion\u2014when he spies from far A bull that seems to meditate the war, Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand\u2014 Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand: Imagine eager Turnus not more slow, To rush from high on his unequal foe.", " This dismal news, not from uncertain fame, But sad spectators, to the hero came: His friends upon the brink of ruin stand, Unless reliev\u2019d by his victorious hand. He whirls his sword around, without delay, And hews thro\u2019 adverse foes an ample way, To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud: Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow\u2019d To large deserts, are present to his eyes; His plighted hand, and hospitable ties. Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred, He took in fight, and living victims led, To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire, In sacrifice, before his fun\u2019ral fire. At Magus next he threw: he stoop\u2019d below The flying spear, and shunn\u2019d the promis\u2019d blow; Then, creeping, clasp\u2019d the hero\u2019s knees, and pray\u2019d: \u201cBy young Iulus, by thy father\u2019s shade, O spare my life, and send me back to see My longing sire, and tender progeny! A lofty house I have, and wealth untold, In silver ingots, and in bars of gold: All these, and sums besides, which see no day, The ransom of this one poor life shall pay. If I survive, will Troy the less prevail? A single soul\u2019s too light to turn the scale.\u201d He said. The hero sternly thus replied: \u201cThy bars and ingots, and the sums beside, Leave for thy children\u2019s lot. Thy Turnus broke All rules of war by one relentless stroke, When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone My father\u2019s shadow, but my living son.\u201d Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft, He seiz\u2019d his helm, and dragg\u2019d him with his left; Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath\u2019d, Up to the hilts his shining falchion sheath\u2019d."], "How does Juno get Turnus to leave the battle?": [" Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " You beg a truce, which I would gladly give, Not only for the slain, but those who live. I came not hither but by Heav\u2019n\u2019s command, And sent by fate to share the Latian land. Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied My proffer\u2019d friendship, and my promis\u2019d bride; Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try His cause in arms, to conquer or to die. My right and his are in dispute: the slain Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. In equal arms let us alone contend; And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. This is the way (so tell him) to possess The royal virgin, and restore the peace. Bear this message back, with ample leave, That your slain friends may fun\u2019ral rites receive.\u201d Thus having said\u2014th\u2019 embassadors, amaz\u2019d, Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz\u2019d. Drances, their chief, who harbour\u2019d in his breast Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess\u2019d, Broke silence first, and to the godlike man, With graceful action bowing, thus began: \u201cAuspicious prince, in arms a mighty name, But yet whose actions far transcend your fame; Would I your justice or your force express, Thought can but equal; and all words are less. Your answer we shall thankfully relate, And favours granted to the Latian state. If wish\u2019d success our labour shall attend, Think peace concluded, and the king your friend: Let Turnus leave the realm to your command, And seek alliance in some other land: Build you the city which your fates assign; We shall be proud in the great work to join.\u201d Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade The rest impower\u2019d, that soon a truce is made.", " Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow\u2019rs, Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow\u2019rs, Were doom\u2019d to kill, while Heav\u2019n prolong\u2019d his date; But who can pass the bounds, prefix\u2019d by fate? In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held Two palaces, and was from each expell\u2019d: Of all the mighty man, the last remains A little spot of foreign earth contains. And now both hosts their broken troops unite In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight. Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line: Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads. They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, Resolv\u2019d on death, impatient of disgrace; And, where one falls, another fills his place. The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son To leave th\u2019 unfinish\u2019d fight, and storm the town: For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain, He views th\u2019 unguarded city from afar, In careless quiet, and secure of war. Occasion offers, and excites his mind To dare beyond the task he first design\u2019d. Resolv\u2019d, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight: Attended thus, he takes a neighb\u2019ring height; The crowding troops about their gen\u2019ral stand, All under arms, and wait his high command. Then thus the lofty prince: \u201cHear and obey, Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay Jove is with us; and what I have decreed Requires our utmost vigour, and our speed.", " These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, And the rich present to the prince commends. Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, To their expecting lord with peace return. But jealous Juno, from Pachynus\u2019 height, As she from Argos took her airy flight, Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight. She saw the Trojan and his joyful train Descend upon the shore, desert the main, Design a town, and, with unhop\u2019d success, Th\u2019 embassadors return with promis\u2019d peace. Then, pierc\u2019d with pain, she shook her haughty head, Sigh\u2019d from her inward soul, and thus she said: \u201cO hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! O fates of Troy, which Juno\u2019s fates oppose! Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, But slain revive, and, taken, scape again? When execrable Troy in ashes lay, Thro\u2019 fires and swords and seas they forc\u2019d their way. Then vanquish\u2019d Juno must in vain contend, Her rage disarm\u2019d, her empire at an end. Breathless and tir\u2019d, is all my fury spent? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? As if \u2019twere little from their town to chase, I thro\u2019 the seas pursued their exil\u2019d race; Ingag\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, oppos\u2019d the stormy main; But billows roar\u2019d, and tempests rag\u2019d in vain. What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, When these they overpass, and those they shun? On Tiber\u2019s shores they land, secure of fate, Triumphant o\u2019er the storms and Juno\u2019s hate. Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia\u2019s wrath, Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon; What great offence had either people done?"], "How does Evander react to his son's death?": [" The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force. Then Venulus to Diomede they send, To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, Declare the common danger, and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm: \u201cAeneas, landed on the Latian coast, With banish\u2019d gods, and with a baffled host, Yet now aspir\u2019d to conquest of the state, And claim\u2019d a title from the gods and fate; What num\u2019rous nations in his quarrel came, And how they spread his formidable name. What he design\u2019d, what mischief might arise, If fortune favour\u2019d his first enterprise, Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, And common interest, was involv\u2019d in theirs.\u201d While Turnus and th\u2019 allies thus urge the war, The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.", " when Fortune gave the rest Of my full wishes, she refus\u2019d the best! She came; but brought not thee along, to bless My longing eyes, and share in my success: She grudg\u2019d thy safe return, the triumphs due To prosp\u2019rous valour, in the public view. Not thus I promis\u2019d, when thy father lent Thy needless succour with a sad consent; Embrac\u2019d me, parting for th\u2019 Etrurian land, And sent me to possess a large command. He warn\u2019d, and from his own experience told, Our foes were warlike, disciplin\u2019d, and bold. And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return, Rich odors on his loaded altars burn, While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare To send him back his portion of the war, A bloody breathless body, which can owe No farther debt, but to the pow\u2019rs below. The wretched father, ere his race is run, Shall view the fun\u2019ral honours of his son. These are my triumphs of the Latian war, Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care! And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see A son whose death disgrac\u2019d his ancestry; Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev\u2019d: Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv\u2019d. He died no death to make thee wish, too late, Thou hadst not liv\u2019d to see his shameful fate: But what a champion has th\u2019 Ausonian coast, And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!\u201d Thus having mourn\u2019d, he gave the word around, To raise the breathless body from the ground; And chose a thousand horse, the flow\u2019r of all His warlike troops, to wait the funeral, To bear him back and share Evander\u2019s grief: A well-becoming, but a weak relief.", " The war at hand appears with more affright, And rises ev\u2019ry moment to the sight. Then old Evander, with a close embrace, Strain\u2019d his departing friend; and tears o\u2019erflow his face. \u201cWould Heav\u2019n,\u201d said he, \u201cmy strength and youth recall, Such as I was beneath Praeneste\u2019s wall; Then when I made the foremost foes retire, And set whole heaps of conquer\u2019d shields on fire; When Herilus in single fight I slew, Whom with three lives Feronia did endue; And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore, Till the last ebbing soul return\u2019d no more\u2014 Such if I stood renew\u2019d, not these alarms, Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas\u2019 arms; Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish\u2019d, boast His rapes and murders on the Tuscan coast. Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring Relief, and hear a father and a king! If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see My son return with peace and victory; If the lov\u2019d boy shall bless his father\u2019s sight; If we shall meet again with more delight; Then draw my life in length; let me sustain, In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain. But if your hard decrees\u2014which, O! I dread\u2014 Have doom\u2019d to death his undeserving head; This, O this very moment, let me die! While hopes and fears in equal balance lie; While, yet possess\u2019d of all his youthful charms, I strain him close within these aged arms; Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!\u201d He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground.", " Can I, without so dear a father, live? You term it prudence, what I baseness call: Could such a word from such a parent fall? If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain, That nothing should of ruin\u2019d Troy remain, And you conspire with Fortune to be slain, The way to death is wide, th\u2019 approaches near: For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear, Reeking with Priam\u2019s blood: the wretch who slew The son (inhuman) in the father\u2019s view, And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew. O goddess mother, give me back to Fate; Your gift was undesir\u2019d, and came too late! Did you, for this, unhappy me convey Thro\u2019 foes and fires, to see my house a prey? Shall I my father, wife, and son behold, Welt\u2019ring in blood, each other\u2019s arms infold? Haste! gird my sword, tho\u2019 spent and overcome: \u2019Tis the last summons to receive our doom.

I went; but sad Creusa stopp\u2019d my way, And cross the threshold in my passage lay, Embrac\u2019d my knees, and, when I would have gone, Shew\u2019d me my feeble sire and tender son: \u2018If death be your design, at least,\u2019 said she, \u2018Take us along to share your destiny. If any farther hopes in arms remain, This place, these pledges of your love, maintain."], "What does Aeneas do that impresses the Latin messengers?": [" Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow\u2019rs, Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow\u2019rs, Were doom\u2019d to kill, while Heav\u2019n prolong\u2019d his date; But who can pass the bounds, prefix\u2019d by fate? In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held Two palaces, and was from each expell\u2019d: Of all the mighty man, the last remains A little spot of foreign earth contains. And now both hosts their broken troops unite In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight. Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line: Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads. They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, Resolv\u2019d on death, impatient of disgrace; And, where one falls, another fills his place. The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son To leave th\u2019 unfinish\u2019d fight, and storm the town: For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain, He views th\u2019 unguarded city from afar, In careless quiet, and secure of war. Occasion offers, and excites his mind To dare beyond the task he first design\u2019d. Resolv\u2019d, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight: Attended thus, he takes a neighb\u2019ring height; The crowding troops about their gen\u2019ral stand, All under arms, and wait his high command. Then thus the lofty prince: \u201cHear and obey, Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay Jove is with us; and what I have decreed Requires our utmost vigour, and our speed.", " Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms, To future fight his manly courage warms: He whets his fury, and with joy prepares To terminate at once the ling\u2019ring wars; To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates What Heav\u2019n had promis\u2019d, and expounds the fates. Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease The rage of arms, and ratify the peace. The morn ensuing, from the mountain\u2019s height, Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light; Th\u2019 ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea, From out their flaming nostrils breath\u2019d the day; When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard, In friendly labour join\u2019d, the list prepar\u2019d. Beneath the walls they measure out the space; Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass, Where, with religious their common gods they place. In purest white the priests their heads attire; And living waters bear, and holy fire; And, o\u2019er their linen hoods and shaded hair, Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear. In order issuing from the town appears The Latin legion, arm\u2019d with pointed spears; And from the fields, advancing on a line, The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join: Their various arms afford a pleasing sight; A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar\u2019d for fight. Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride, Glitt\u2019ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed; Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line, And there Messapus, born of seed divine.

This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught; And, building Alba, to the Latins brought; Shew\u2019d what he learn\u2019d: the Latin sires impart To their succeeding sons the graceful art; From these imperial Rome receiv\u2019d the game, Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name. Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate: But Fortune soon resum\u2019d her ancient hate; For, while they pay the dead his annual dues, Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views; And sends the goddess of the various bow, To try new methods of revenge below; Supplies the winds to wing her airy way, Where in the port secure the navy lay. Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends, And, undiscern\u2019d, her fatal voyage ends. She saw the gath\u2019ring crowd; and, gliding thence, The desert shore, and fleet without defence. The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone, With sighs and tears Anchises\u2019 death bemoan; Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes, Their pity to themselves renews their cries. \u201cAlas!\u201d said one, \u201cwhat oceans yet remain For us to sail! what labours to sustain!\u201d All take the word, and, with a gen\u2019ral groan, Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own. The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains, And in a woman\u2019s form her heav\u2019nly limbs restrains.

First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace, He cries aloud, to make the combat cease: \u201cRutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire! The fight is mine; and me the gods require. \u2019Tis just that I should vindicate alone The broken truce, or for the breach atone.

The Trojan hero, who receiv\u2019d from fame The welcome sound, and heard the champion\u2019s name, Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls, Greedy of war where greater glory calls. He springs to fight, exulting in his force His jointed armour rattles in the course. Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows, Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows, His head divine obscure in clouds he hides, And shakes the sounding forest on his sides. The nations, overaw\u2019d, surcease the fight; Immovable their bodies, fix\u2019d their sight. Ev\u2019n death stands still; nor from above they throw Their darts, nor drive their batt\u2019ring-rams below. In silent order either army stands, And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands.

BOOK XI THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas erects a trophy of the spoils of Mezentius, grants a truce for burying the dead, and sends home the body of Pallas with great solemnity. Latinus calls a council, to propose offers of peace to Aeneas; which occasions great animosity betwixt Turnus and Drances. In the mean time there is a sharp engagement of the horse; wherein Camilla signalizes herself, is killed, and the Latine troops are entirely defeated. Scarce had the rosy Morning rais\u2019d her head Above the waves, and left her wat\u2019ry bed; The pious chief, whom double cares attend For his unburied soldiers and his friend, Yet first to Heav\u2019n perform\u2019d a victor\u2019s vows: He bar\u2019d an ancient oak of all her boughs; Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac\u2019d, Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac\u2019d. The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn, Now on a naked snag in triumph borne, Was hung on high, and glitter\u2019d from afar, A trophy sacred to the God of War. Above his arms, fix\u2019d on the leafless wood, Appear\u2019d his plumy crest, besmear\u2019d with blood: His brazen buckler on the left was seen; Truncheons of shiver\u2019d lances hung between; And on the right was placed his corslet, bor\u2019d; And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword. A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man, Who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began: \u201cOur toils, my friends, are crown\u2019d with sure success; The greater part perform\u2019d, achieve the less.", " BOOK X THE ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\u201d Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large: \u201cO pow\u2019r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else protection can we fly?)", " O citizens, we wage unequal war, With men not only Heav\u2019n\u2019s peculiar care, But Heav\u2019n\u2019s own race; unconquer\u2019d in the field, Or, conquer\u2019d, yet unknowing how to yield. What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down: Our hopes must centre on ourselves alone. Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain, You see too well; nor need my words explain. Vanquish\u2019d without resource; laid flat by fate; Factions within, a foe without the gate! Not but I grant that all perform\u2019d their parts With manly force, and with undaunted hearts: With our united strength the war we wag\u2019d; With equal numbers, equal arms, engag\u2019d. You see th\u2019 event.\u2014Now hear what I propose, To save our friends, and satisfy our foes. A tract of land the Latins have possess\u2019d Along the Tiber, stretching to the west, Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till, And their mix\u2019d cattle graze the fruitful hill. Those mountains fill\u2019d with firs, that lower land, If you consent, the Trojan shall command, Call\u2019d into part of what is ours; and there, On terms agreed, the common country share. There let them build and settle, if they please; Unless they choose once more to cross the seas, In search of seats remote from Italy, And from unwelcome inmates set us free. Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed, Or twice as many more, if more they need. Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood Runs equal with the margin of the flood: Let them the number and the form assign; The care and cost of all the stores be mine.", " The guard reliev\u2019d, the gen\u2019rous couple went To find the council at the royal tent. All creatures else forgot their daily care, And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate In nightly council for th\u2019 indanger\u2019d state. They vote a message to their absent chief, Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief. Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, Remote from clamour, and secure from foes. On their left arms their ample shields they bear, The right reclin\u2019d upon the bending spear. Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, And beg admission, eager to be heard: Th\u2019 affair important, not to be deferr\u2019d. Ascanius bids \u2019em be conducted in, Ord\u2019ring the more experienc\u2019d to begin. Then Nisus thus: \u201cYe fathers, lend your ears; Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. The foe, securely drench\u2019d in sleep and wine, Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; And where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies, Cov\u2019ring the plain, and curling to the skies, Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, Close by the sea, a passage we have spied, Which will our way to great Aeneas guide. Expect each hour to see him safe again, Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. Snatch we the lucky minute while we may; Nor can we be mistaken in the way; For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen The rising turrets, and the stream between, And know the winding course, with ev\u2019ry ford.\u201d He ceas\u2019d; and old Alethes took the word: \u201cOur country gods, in whom our trust we place, Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race, While we behold such dauntless worth appear In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.\u201d Then into tears of joy the father broke; Each in his longing arms by turns he took; Panted and paus\u2019d; and thus again he spoke: \u201cYe brave young men, what equal gifts can we, In recompense of such desert, decree?"], "Who is left behind to defend the Latins' city?": [" So hot th\u2019 assault, so high the tumult rose, While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose As all the Dardan and Argolic race Had been contracted in that narrow space; Or as all Ilium else were void of fear, And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there. Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes, Secure advancing, to the turrets rose: Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold, Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold; Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th\u2019 ascent, While with their right they seize the battlement. From their demolish\u2019d tow\u2019rs the Trojans throw Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe; And heavy beams and rafters from the sides (Such arms their last necessity provides) And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high, The marks of state and ancient royalty. The guards below, fix\u2019d in the pass, attend The charge undaunted, and the gate defend. Renew\u2019d in courage with recover\u2019d breath, A second time we ran to tempt our death, To clear the palace from the foe, succeed The weary living, and revenge the dead. \u201cA postern door, yet unobserv\u2019d and free, Join\u2019d by the length of a blind gallery, To the king\u2019s closet led: a way well known To Hector\u2019s wife, while Priam held the throne, Thro\u2019 which she brought Astyanax, unseen, To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire\u2019s queen. Thro\u2019 this we pass, and mount the tow\u2019r, from whence With unavailing arms the Trojans make defence.", " These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground: Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound. I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath, My name invoking to revenge his death. Brave Ufens fell with honour on the place, To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace. On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies; His vest and armour are the victor\u2019s prize. Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame, Which only wanted, to complete my shame? How will the Latins hoot their champion\u2019s flight! How Drances will insult and point them to the sight! Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below, (Since those above so small compassion show,) Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame, Which not belies my great forefather\u2019s name!\u201d He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed Came Sages urging on his foamy steed: Fix\u2019d on his wounded face a shaft he bore, And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before: \u201cTurnus, on you, on you alone, depends Our last relief: compassionate your friends! Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on, With arms invests, with flames invades the town: The brands are toss\u2019d on high; the winds conspire To drive along the deluge of the fire. All eyes are fix\u2019d on you: your foes rejoice; Ev\u2019n the king staggers, and suspends his choice; Doubts to deliver or defend the town, Whom to reject, or whom to call his son. The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac\u2019d, Herself suborning death, has breath\u2019d her last.", " Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me; And both shall draw the lots their fates decree. Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend; And, if she favours those, let those defend: The Fates will find their way.\u201d The Thund\u2019rer said, And shook the sacred honours of his head, Attesting Styx, th\u2019 inviolable flood, And the black regions of his brother god. Trembled the poles of heav\u2019n, and earth confess\u2019d the nod. This end the sessions had: the senate rise, And to his palace wait their sov\u2019reign thro\u2019 the skies. Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes Within their walls the Trojan host inclose: They wound, they kill, they watch at ev\u2019ry gate; Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate. Th\u2019 Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief, Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief. Thin on the tow\u2019rs they stand; and ev\u2019n those few A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew. Yet in the face of danger some there stood: The two bold brothers of Sarpedon\u2019s blood, Asius and Acmon; both th\u2019 Assaraci; Young Haemon, and tho\u2019 young, resolv\u2019d to die. With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join\u2019d; Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind. From Acmon\u2019s hands a rolling stone there came, So large, it half deserv\u2019d a mountain\u2019s name: Strong-sinew\u2019d was the youth, and big of bone; His brother Mnestheus could not more have done, Or the great father of th\u2019 intrepid son. Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send; And some with darts, and some with stones defend.", " His hands he fills With pointed jav\u2019lins; on his head he lac\u2019d His glitt\u2019ring helm, which terribly was grac\u2019d With waving horsehair, nodding from afar; Then spurr\u2019d his thund\u2019ring steed amidst the war. Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought, Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought Of inborn worth, his lab\u2019ring soul oppress\u2019d, Roll\u2019d in his eyes, and rag\u2019d within his breast. Then loud he call\u2019d Aeneas thrice by name: The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came. \u201cGreat Jove,\u201d he said, \u201cand the far-shooting god, Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!\u201d He spoke no more; but hasten\u2019d, void of fear, And threaten\u2019d with his long protended spear. To whom Mezentius thus: \u201cThy vaunts are vain. My Lausus lies extended on the plain: He\u2019s lost! thy conquest is already won; The wretched sire is murder\u2019d in the son. Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy. Forbear thy threats: my bus\u2019ness is to die; But first receive this parting legacy.\u201d He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent; Another after, and another went. Round in a spacious ring he rides the field, And vainly plies th\u2019 impenetrable shield. Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel\u2019d, Turn\u2019d as he turn\u2019d: the golden orb withstood The strokes, and bore about an iron wood. Impatient of delay, and weary grown, Still to defend, and to defend alone, To wrench the darts which in his buckler light, Urg\u2019d and o\u2019er-labour\u2019d in unequal fight; At length resolv\u2019d, he throws with all his force Full at the temples of the warrior horse."], "Why does Turnus have to call off the ambush of Aeneas?": [" The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill\u2019d, Sends his light horse before to scour the field: Himself, thro\u2019 steep ascents and thorny brakes, A larger compass to the city takes. This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare To foil his cunning, and his force to dare; With chosen foot his passage to forelay, And place an ambush in the winding way. Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse; The brave Messapus shall thy troops enforce With those of Tibur, and the Latian band, Subjected all to thy supreme command.\u201d This said, he warns Messapus to the war, Then ev\u2019ry chief exhorts with equal care. All thus encourag\u2019d, his own troops he joins, And hastes to prosecute his deep designs. Inclos\u2019d with hills, a winding valley lies, By nature form\u2019d for fraud, and fitted for surprise. A narrow track, by human steps untrode, Leads, thro\u2019 perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode. High o\u2019er the vale a steepy mountain stands, Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands. The top is level, an offensive seat Of war; and from the war a safe retreat: For, on the right and left, is room to press The foes at hand, or from afar distress; To drive \u2019em headlong downward, and to pour On their descending backs a stony show\u2019r. Thither young Turnus took the well-known way, Possess\u2019d the pass, and in blind ambush lay. Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies, Beheld th\u2019 approaching war with hateful eyes, And call\u2019d the light-foot Opis to her aid, Her most belov\u2019d and ever-trusty maid; Then with a sigh began: \u201cCamilla goes To meet her death amidst her fatal foes: The nymphs I lov\u2019d of all my mortal train, Invested with Diana\u2019s arms, in vain.", " Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close, But leave their friends excluded with their foes. The vanquish\u2019d cry; the victors loudly shout; \u2019Tis terror all within, and slaughter all without. Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall, Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall. The Latian virgins, valiant with despair, Arm\u2019d on the tow\u2019rs, the common danger share: So much of zeal their country\u2019s cause inspir\u2019d; So much Camilla\u2019s great example fir\u2019d. Poles, sharpen\u2019d in the flames, from high they throw, With imitated darts, to gall the foe. Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath, And crowd each other to be first in death. Meantime to Turnus, ambush\u2019d in the shade, With heavy tidings came th\u2019 unhappy maid: \u201cThe Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill\u2019d; The foes, entirely masters of the field, Like a resistless flood, come rolling on: The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town.\u201d Inflam\u2019d with rage, (for so the Furies fire The Daunian\u2019s breast, and so the Fates require,) He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain Possess\u2019d, and downward issues on the plain. Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. Thro\u2019 the black forest and the ferny brake, Unknowingly secure, their way they take; From the rough mountains to the plain descend, And there, in order drawn, their line extend. Both armies now in open fields are seen; Nor far the distance of the space between.", " The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force. Then Venulus to Diomede they send, To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, Declare the common danger, and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm: \u201cAeneas, landed on the Latian coast, With banish\u2019d gods, and with a baffled host, Yet now aspir\u2019d to conquest of the state, And claim\u2019d a title from the gods and fate; What num\u2019rous nations in his quarrel came, And how they spread his formidable name. What he design\u2019d, what mischief might arise, If fortune favour\u2019d his first enterprise, Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, And common interest, was involv\u2019d in theirs.\u201d While Turnus and th\u2019 allies thus urge the war, The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare."], "Why does Juno enlist the help of Turnus's sister?": [" Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late, The gath\u2019ring storm just breaking on the state, Dismiss\u2019d the council till a fitter time, And own\u2019d his easy temper as his crime, Who, forc\u2019d against his reason, had complied To break the treaty for the promis\u2019d bride. Some help to sink new trenches; others aid To ram the stones, or raise the palisade. Hoarse trumpets sound th\u2019 alarm; around the walls Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labour calls. A sad procession in the streets is seen, Of matrons, that attend the mother queen: High in her chair she sits, and, at her side, With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride. They mount the cliff, where Pallas\u2019 temple stands; Pray\u2019rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands, With censers first they fume the sacred shrine, Then in this common supplication join: \u201cO patroness of arms, unspotted maid, Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid! Break short the pirate\u2019s lance; pronounce his fate, And lay the Phrygian low before the gate.\u201d Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast Well-temper\u2019d steel and scaly brass invest: The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold Are mingled metal damask\u2019d o\u2019er with gold. His faithful falchion sits upon his side; Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide: But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends, With godlike grace, he from the tow\u2019r descends. Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare His absent rival, and to promise war.", " Propitious Heav\u2019n, and gracious Juno, lead This wand\u2019ring navy to your needful aid: How will your empire spread, your city rise, From such a union, and with such allies? Implore the favour of the pow\u2019rs above, And leave the conduct of the rest to love. Continue still your hospitable way, And still invent occasions of their stay, Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat, And planks and oars repair their shatter\u2019d fleet.\u201d These words, which from a friend and sister came, With ease resolv\u2019d the scruples of her fame, And added fury to the kindled flame. Inspir\u2019d with hope, the project they pursue; On ev\u2019ry altar sacrifice renew: A chosen ewe of two years old they pay To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day; Preferring Juno\u2019s pow\u2019r, for Juno ties The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys. The beauteous queen before her altar stands, And holds the golden goblet in her hands. A milk-white heifer she with flow\u2019rs adorns, And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns; And, while the priests with pray\u2019r the gods invoke, She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke, With hourly care the sacrifice renews, And anxiously the panting entrails views. What priestly rites, alas! what pious art, What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart! A gentle fire she feeds within her veins, Where the soft god secure in silence reigns. Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves, From street to street the raving Dido roves.", " Not less the clamour, than if ancient Tyre, Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire, The rolling ruin, with their lov\u2019d abodes, Involv\u2019d the blazing temples of their gods. Her sister hears; and, furious with despair, She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair, And, calling on Eliza\u2019s name aloud, Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd. \u201cWas all that pomp of woe for this prepar\u2019d; These fires, this fun\u2019ral pile, these altars rear\u2019d? Was all this train of plots contriv\u2019d,\u201d said she, \u201cAll only to deceive unhappy me? Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend? Thy summon\u2019d sister, and thy friend, had come; One sword had serv\u2019d us both, one common tomb: Was I to raise the pile, the pow\u2019rs invoke, Not to be present at the fatal stroke? At once thou hast destroy\u2019d thyself and me, Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony! Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath.\u201d This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste, And in her arms the gasping queen embrac\u2019d; Her temples chaf\u2019d; and her own garments tore, To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore. Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head, And, fainting thrice, fell grov\u2019ling on the bed; Thrice op\u2019d her heavy eyes, and sought the light, But, having found it, sicken\u2019d at the sight, And clos\u2019d her lids at last in endless night.", " These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, And the rich present to the prince commends. Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, To their expecting lord with peace return. But jealous Juno, from Pachynus\u2019 height, As she from Argos took her airy flight, Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight. She saw the Trojan and his joyful train Descend upon the shore, desert the main, Design a town, and, with unhop\u2019d success, Th\u2019 embassadors return with promis\u2019d peace. Then, pierc\u2019d with pain, she shook her haughty head, Sigh\u2019d from her inward soul, and thus she said: \u201cO hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! O fates of Troy, which Juno\u2019s fates oppose! Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, But slain revive, and, taken, scape again? When execrable Troy in ashes lay, Thro\u2019 fires and swords and seas they forc\u2019d their way. Then vanquish\u2019d Juno must in vain contend, Her rage disarm\u2019d, her empire at an end. Breathless and tir\u2019d, is all my fury spent? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? As if \u2019twere little from their town to chase, I thro\u2019 the seas pursued their exil\u2019d race; Ingag\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, oppos\u2019d the stormy main; But billows roar\u2019d, and tempests rag\u2019d in vain. What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, When these they overpass, and those they shun? On Tiber\u2019s shores they land, secure of fate, Triumphant o\u2019er the storms and Juno\u2019s hate. Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia\u2019s wrath, Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon; What great offence had either people done?"], "What does Juturna convince the Latins to do?": [" A cloud of blinding dust is rais\u2019d around, Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground. Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far Beheld the progress of the moving war: With him the Latins view\u2019d the cover\u2019d plains, And the chill blood ran backward in their veins. Juturna saw th\u2019 advancing troops appear, And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear. Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train, Clos\u2019d in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore From the mid ocean, drives the waves before; The painful hind with heavy heart foresees The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees; With like impetuous rage the prince appears Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. And now both armies shock in open field; Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill\u2019d. Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain (All fam\u2019d in arms, and of the Latian train) By Gyas\u2019, Mnestheus\u2019, and Achates\u2019 hand. The fatal augur falls, by whose command The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued With Trojan blood, th\u2019 unhappy fight renew\u2019d. Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky, And o\u2019er the field the frighted Latins fly. The prince disdains the dastards to pursue, Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few; Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain, He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain. Juturna heard, and, seiz\u2019d with mortal fear, Forc\u2019d from the beam her brother\u2019s charioteer; Assumes his shape, his armour, and his mien, And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen.", " Th\u2019 incumbent hero wrench\u2019d, and pull\u2019d, and strain\u2019d; But still the stubborn earth the steel detain\u2019d. Juturna took her time; and, while in vain He strove, assum\u2019d Meticus\u2019 form again, And, in that imitated shape, restor\u2019d To the despairing prince his Daunian sword. The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief, Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief, T\u2019 assert her offspring with a greater deed, From the tough root the ling\u2019ring weapon freed. Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance: One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance; And both resolv\u2019d alike to try their fatal chance. Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke, Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock: \u201cWhat new arrest, O Queen of Heav\u2019n, is sent To stop the Fates now lab\u2019ring in th\u2019 event? What farther hopes are left thee to pursue? Divine Aeneas, (and thou know\u2019st it too,) Foredoom\u2019d, to these celestial seats are due. What more attempts for Turnus can be made, That thus thou ling\u2019rest in this lonely shade? Is it becoming of the due respect And awful honour of a god elect, A wound unworthy of our state to feel, Patient of human hands and earthly steel? Or seems it just, the sister should restore A second sword, when one was lost before, And arm a conquer\u2019d wretch against his conqueror? For what, without thy knowledge and avow, Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do? At last, in deference to my love, forbear To lodge within thy soul this anxious care; Reclin\u2019d upon my breast, thy grief unload: Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?", " Now all things to their utmost issue tend, Push\u2019d by the Fates to their appointed end. While leave was giv\u2019n thee, and a lawful hour For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow\u2019r, Toss\u2019d on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress, And, driv\u2019n ashore, with hostile arms oppress; Deform the royal house; and, from the side Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride: Now cease at my command.\u201d The Thund\u2019rer said; And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made: \u201cBecause your dread decree too well I knew, From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew. Else should you not behold me here, alone, Involv\u2019d in empty clouds, my friends bemoan, But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight Engag\u2019d against my foes in mortal fight. \u2019Tis true, Juturna mingled in the strife By my command, to save her brother\u2019s life, At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake, (The most religious oath the gods can take,) With this restriction, not to bend the bow, Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw. And now, resign\u2019d to your superior might, And tir\u2019d with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight. This let me beg (and this no fates withstand) Both for myself and for your father\u2019s land, That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace, (Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,) The laws of either nation be the same; But let the Latins still retain their name, Speak the same language which they spoke before, Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore.", " One sister plague if these from heav\u2019n he sent, To fright Juturna with a dire portent. The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow, Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies, And drench\u2019d in pois\u2019nous juice, the sure destruction flies. With such a sudden and unseen a flight Shot thro\u2019 the clouds the daughter of the night. Soon as the field inclos\u2019d she had in view, And from afar her destin\u2019d quarry knew, Contracted, to the boding bird she turns, Which haunts the ruin\u2019d piles and hallow\u2019d urns, And beats about the tombs with nightly wings, Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings. Thus lessen\u2019d in her form, with frightful cries The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies, Flaps on his shield, and flutters o\u2019er his eyes. A lazy chillness crept along his blood; Chok\u2019d was his voice; his hair with horror stood. Juturna from afar beheld her fly, And knew th\u2019 ill omen, by her screaming cry And stridor of her wings. Amaz\u2019d with fear, Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair. \u201cAh me!\u201d she cries, \u201cin this unequal strife What can thy sister more to save thy life? Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend In arms with that inexorable fiend? Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night; The lashing of your wings I know too well, The sounding flight, and fun\u2019ral screams of hell! These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove, The worthy recompense of ravish\u2019d love!"], "What wound does Aeneas suffer as the battle begins?": [" Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear Two lions carv\u2019d, which rising Ida bear\u2014 Ida, to wand\u2019ring Trojans ever dear. Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate, Revolving war\u2019s events, and various fate. His left young Pallas kept, fix\u2019d to his side, And oft of winds enquir\u2019d, and of the tide; Oft of the stars, and of their wat\u2019ry way; And what he suffer\u2019d both by land and sea. Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring! The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing, Which follow\u2019d great Aeneas to the war: Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare. A thousand youths brave Massicus obey, Borne in the Tiger thro\u2019 the foaming sea; From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care: For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear. Fierce Abas next: his men bright armour wore; His stern Apollo\u2019s golden statue bore. Six hundred Populonia sent along, All skill\u2019d in martial exercise, and strong. Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins, An isle renown\u2019d for steel, and unexhausted mines. Asylas on his prow the third appears, Who heav\u2019n interprets, and the wand\u2019ring stars; From offer\u2019d entrails prodigies expounds, And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. A thousand spears in warlike order stand, Sent by the Pisans under his command. Fair Astur follows in the wat\u2019ry field, Proud of his manag\u2019d horse and painted shield. Gravisca, noisome from the neighb\u2019ring fen, And his own Caere, sent three hundred men; With those which Minio\u2019s fields and Pyrgi gave, All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave.", " See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun? Now, by those holy vows, so late begun, By this right hand, (since I have nothing more To challenge, but the faith you gave before;) I beg you by these tears too truly shed, By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed; If ever Dido, when you most were kind, Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch\u2019d your mind; By these my pray\u2019rs, if pray\u2019rs may yet have place, Pity the fortunes of a falling race. For you I have provok\u2019d a tyrant\u2019s hate, Incens\u2019d the Libyan and the Tyrian state; For you alone I suffer in my fame, Bereft of honour, and expos\u2019d to shame. Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest? (That only name remains of all the rest!) What have I left? or whither can I fly? Must I attend Pygmalion\u2019s cruelty, Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead A queen that proudly scorn\u2019d his proffer\u2019d bed? Had you deferr\u2019d, at least, your hasty flight, And left behind some pledge of our delight, Some babe to bless the mother\u2019s mournful sight, Some young Aeneas, to supply your place, Whose features might express his father\u2019s face; I should not then complain to live bereft Of all my husband, or be wholly left.\u201d Here paus\u2019d the queen. Unmov\u2019d he holds his eyes, By Jove\u2019s command; nor suffer\u2019d love to rise, Tho\u2019 heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies: \u201cFair queen, you never can enough repeat Your boundless favours, or I own my debt; Nor can my mind forget Eliza\u2019s name, While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.", " Stanch\u2019d is the blood, and in the bottom stands: The steel, but scarcely touch\u2019d with tender hands, Moves up, and follows of its own accord, And health and vigour are at once restor\u2019d. Iapis first perceiv\u2019d the closing wound, And first the footsteps of a god he found. \u201cArms! arms!\u201d he cries; \u201cthe sword and shield prepare, And send the willing chief, renew\u2019d, to war. This is no mortal work, no cure of mine, Nor art\u2019s effect, but done by hands divine. Some god our general to the battle sends; Some god preserves his life for greater ends.\u201d The hero arms in haste; his hands infold His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold: Inflam\u2019d to fight, and rushing to the field, That hand sustaining the celestial shield, This gripes the lance, and with such vigour shakes, That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes. Then with a close embrace he strain\u2019d his son, And, kissing thro\u2019 his helmet, thus begun: \u201cMy son, from my example learn the war, In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare; But happier chance than mine attend thy care! This day my hand thy tender age shall shield, And crown with honours of the conquer\u2019d field: Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth To toils of war, be mindful of my worth; Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known, For Hector\u2019s nephew, and Aeneas\u2019 son.\u201d He said; and, striding, issued on the plain. Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num\u2019rous train, Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take, And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.", " Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh.

Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land."], "Why does Turnus call off the battle and invite Aeneas to single combat?": [" Both to the city bend.

Jove, could\u2019st thou view, and not avert thy sight, Two jarring nations join\u2019d in cruel fight, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found, Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground; Betwixt his ribs the jav\u2019lin drove so just, It reach\u2019d his heart, nor needs a second thrust. Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail\u2019d Diores, and in equal fight prevail\u2019d. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, Whom without respite at one charge he slew: Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress\u2019d, And sad Onythes, added to the rest, Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore. Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore, And from Apollo\u2019s fane to battle sent, O\u2019erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent. Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill\u2019d, Who long had shunn\u2019d the dangers of the field: On Lerna\u2019s lake a silent life he led, And with his nets and angle earn\u2019d his bread; Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew, But wisely from th\u2019 infectious world withdrew: Poor was his house; his father\u2019s painful hand Discharg\u2019d his rent, and plow\u2019d another\u2019s land.", " Already the Rutulians deem their man O\u2019ermatch\u2019d in arms, before the fight began. First rising fears are whisper\u2019d thro\u2019 the crowd; Then, gath\u2019ring sound, they murmur more aloud. Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes The champions\u2019 bulk, their sinews, and their size: The nearer they approach, the more is known Th\u2019 apparent disadvantage of their own. Turnus himself appears in public sight Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight. Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands; And, while he mutters undistinguish\u2019d pray\u2019rs, A livid deadness in his cheeks appears. With anxious pleasure when Juturna view\u2019d Th\u2019 increasing fright of the mad multitude, When their short sighs and thick\u2019ning sobs she heard, And found their ready minds for change prepar\u2019d; Dissembling her immortal form, she took Camertus\u2019 mien, his habit, and his look; A chief of ancient blood; in arms well known Was his great sire, and he his greater son. His shape assum\u2019d, amid the ranks she ran, And humoring their first motions, thus began: \u201cFor shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight Of one expos\u2019d for all, in single fight? Can we, before the face of heav\u2019n, confess Our courage colder, or our numbers less? View all the Trojan host, th\u2019 Arcadian band, And Tuscan army; count \u2019em as they stand: Undaunted to the battle if we go, Scarce ev\u2019ry second man will share a foe.", " For you, my royal father, and my fame, I, Turnus, not the least of all my name, Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand, And I alone will answer his demand. Drances shall rest secure, and neither share The danger, nor divide the prize of war.\u201d While they debate, nor these nor those will yield, Aeneas draws his forces to the field, And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed Return, and thro\u2019 the frighted city spread Th\u2019 unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried, In battle marching by the river side, And bending to the town. They take th\u2019 alarm: Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. Th\u2019 impetuous youth press forward to the field; They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield: The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; Old feeble men with fainter groans reply; A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky, Like that of swans remurm\u2019ring to the floods, Or birds of diff\u2019ring kinds in hollow woods. Turnus th\u2019 occasion takes, and cries aloud: \u201cTalk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd: Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls, And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls.\u201d He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace, Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place: \u201cThou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band. Messapus and Catillus, post your force Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse. Some guard the passes, others man the wall; Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call.\u201d They swarm from ev\u2019ry quarter of the town, And with disorder\u2019d haste the rampires crown."], "On what condition does Juno give up her attacks on Aeneas?": [" These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, And the rich present to the prince commends.

When execrable Troy in ashes lay, Thro\u2019 fires and swords and seas they forc\u2019d their way. Then vanquish\u2019d Juno must in vain contend, Her rage disarm\u2019d, her empire at an end. Breathless and tir\u2019d, is all my fury spent? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? As if \u2019twere little from their town to chase, I thro\u2019 the seas pursued their exil\u2019d race; Ingag\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, oppos\u2019d the stormy main; But billows roar\u2019d, and tempests rag\u2019d in vain. What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, When these they overpass, and those they shun? On Tiber\u2019s shores they land, secure of fate, Triumphant o\u2019er the storms and Juno\u2019s hate. Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia\u2019s wrath, Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon; What great offence had either people done?", " Then water in his hollow palm he took From Tiber\u2019s flood, and thus the pow\u2019rs bespoke: \u201cLaurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed, And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep. Whatever fount, whatever holy deep, Conceals thy wat\u2019ry stores; where\u2019er they rise, And, bubbling from below, salute the skies; Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn, For this thy kind compassion of our woes, Shalt share my morning song and ev\u2019ning vows. But, O be present to thy people\u2019s aid, And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!\u201d Thus having said, two galleys from his stores, With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars. Now on the shore the fatal swine is found. Wond\u2019rous to tell!\u2014She lay along the ground: Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung; She white herself, and white her thirty young. Aeneas takes the mother and her brood, And all on Juno\u2019s altar are bestow\u2019d. The foll\u2019wing night, and the succeeding day, Propitious Tiber smooth\u2019d his wat\u2019ry way: He roll\u2019d his river back, and pois\u2019d he stood, A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore, Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. Shouts from the land give omen to their course, And the pitch\u2019d vessels glide with easy force. The woods and waters wonder at the gleam Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.", " Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite: \u201cO virgin daughter of eternal Night, Give me this once thy labour, to sustain My right, and execute my just disdain. Let not the Trojans, with a feign\u2019d pretence Of proffer\u2019d peace, delude the Latian prince. Expel from Italy that odious name, And let not Juno suffer in her fame. \u2019Tis thine to ruin realms, o\u2019erturn a state, Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate, And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate. Thy hand o\u2019er towns the fun\u2019ral torch displays, And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways. Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds: Confound the peace establish\u2019d, and prepare Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war.\u201d Smear\u2019d as she was with black Gorgonian blood, The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood; And on her wicker wings, sublime thro\u2019 night, She to the Latian palace took her flight: There sought the queen\u2019s apartment, stood before The peaceful threshold, and besieg\u2019d the door. Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast Fir\u2019d with disdain for Turnus dispossess\u2019d, And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest. From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes Her darling plague, the fav\u2019rite of her snakes; With her full force she threw the poisonous dart, And fix\u2019d it deep within Amata\u2019s heart, That, thus envenom\u2019d, she might kindle rage, And sacrifice to strife her house and husband\u2019s age.", " Imperial sway no more exalts my mind; (Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav\u2019n was kind;) Now let my happier foes possess my place, Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race; And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace. Since you can spare, from all your wide command, No spot of earth, no hospitable land, Which may my wand\u2019ring fugitives receive; (Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;) Then, father, (if I still may use that name,) By ruin\u2019d Troy, yet smoking from the flame, I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care, Be freed from danger, and dismiss\u2019d the war: Inglorious let him live, without a crown. The father may be cast on coasts unknown, Struggling with fate; but let me save the son. Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow\u2019rs: In those recesses, and those sacred bow\u2019rs, Obscurely let him rest; his right resign To promis\u2019d empire, and his Julian line. Then Carthage may th\u2019 Ausonian towns destroy, Nor fear the race of a rejected boy. What profits it my son to scape the fire, Arm\u2019d with his gods, and loaded with his sire; To pass the perils of the seas and wind; Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind; To reach th\u2019 Italian shores; if, after all, Our second Pergamus is doom\u2019d to fall? Much better had he curb\u2019d his high desires, And hover\u2019d o\u2019er his ill-extinguish\u2019d fires. To Simois\u2019 banks the fugitives restore, And give them back to war, and all the woes before.\u201d Deep indignation swell\u2019d Saturnia\u2019s heart: \u201cAnd must I own,\u201d she said, \u201cmy secret smart\u2014 What with more decence were in silence kept, And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept?"], "Why does Dido kill herself?": [" What god can tell, what numbers can display, The various labours of that fatal day; What chiefs and champions fell on either side, In combat slain, or by what deaths they died; Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill\u2019d; Who shar\u2019d the fame and fortune of the field! Jove, could\u2019st thou view, and not avert thy sight, Two jarring nations join\u2019d in cruel fight, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found, Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground; Betwixt his ribs the jav\u2019lin drove so just, It reach\u2019d his heart, nor needs a second thrust. Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail\u2019d Diores, and in equal fight prevail\u2019d. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, Whom without respite at one charge he slew: Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress\u2019d, And sad Onythes, added to the rest, Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore. Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore, And from Apollo\u2019s fane to battle sent, O\u2019erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent. Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill\u2019d, Who long had shunn\u2019d the dangers of the field: On Lerna\u2019s lake a silent life he led, And with his nets and angle earn\u2019d his bread; Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew, But wisely from th\u2019 infectious world withdrew: Poor was his house; his father\u2019s painful hand Discharg\u2019d his rent, and plow\u2019d another\u2019s land.", " The town of Camarine from far we see, And fenny lake, undrain\u2019d by fate\u2019s decree. In sight of the Geloan fields we pass, And the large walls, where mighty Gela was; Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown\u2019d, Long for the race of warlike steeds renown\u2019d. We pass\u2019d Selinus, and the palmy land, And widely shun the Lilybaean strand, Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. At length on shore the weary fleet arriv\u2019d, Which Drepanum\u2019s unhappy port receiv\u2019d. Here, after endless labours, often toss\u2019d By raging storms, and driv\u2019n on ev\u2019ry coast, My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost: Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain, Sav\u2019d thro\u2019 a thousand toils, but sav\u2019d in vain The prophet, who my future woes reveal\u2019d, Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal\u2019d; And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill Denounc\u2019d all else, was silent of the ill. This my last labour was. Some friendly god From thence convey\u2019d us to your blest abode.\u201d Thus, to the list\u2019ning queen, the royal guest His wand\u2019ring course and all his toils express\u2019d; And here concluding, he retir\u2019d to rest. BOOK IV THE ARGUMENT. Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus\u2019 consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Aeneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed.", " Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are: A people rude in peace, and rough in war. The rising city, which from far you see, Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. Phoenician Dido rules the growing state, Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother\u2019s hate. Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, Possess\u2019d fair Dido\u2019s bed; and either heart At once was wounded with an equal dart. Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway\u2019d: One who condemn\u2019d divine and human laws. Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, With steel invades his brother\u2019s life by stealth; Before the sacred altar made him bleed, And long from her conceal\u2019d the cruel deed. Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin\u2019d, To soothe his sister, and delude her mind. At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares, And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. The cruel altars and his fate he tells, And the dire secret of his house reveals, Then warns the widow, with her household gods, To seek a refuge in remote abodes. Last, to support her in so long a way, He shows her where his hidden treasure lay. Admonish\u2019d thus, and seiz\u2019d with mortal fright, The queen provides companions of her flight: They meet, and all combine to leave the state, Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.", " Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born, But hewn from harden\u2019d entrails of a rock! And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck! Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear? Did he once look, or lent a list\u2019ning ear, Sigh\u2019d when I sobb\u2019d, or shed one kindly tear? All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind, So foul, that, which is worse, \u2019tis hard to find. Of man\u2019s injustice why should I complain? The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies, Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes; Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies! Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more! I sav\u2019d the shipwreck\u2019d exile on my shore; With needful food his hungry Trojans fed; I took the traitor to my throne and bed: Fool that I was\u2014\u2014 \u2019tis little to repeat The rest, I stor\u2019d and rigg\u2019d his ruin\u2019d fleet. I rave, I rave! A god\u2019s command he pleads, And makes Heav\u2019n accessary to his deeds. Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god, Now Hermes is employ\u2019d from Jove\u2019s abode, To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state Of heav\u2019nly pow\u2019rs were touch\u2019d with human fate! But go! thy flight no longer I detain; Go seek thy promis\u2019d kingdom thro\u2019 the main! Yet, if the heav\u2019ns will hear my pious vow, The faithless waves, not half so false as thou, Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford To thy proud vessels, and their perjur\u2019d lord. Then shalt thou call on injur\u2019d Dido\u2019s name: Dido shall come in a black sulph\u2019ry flame, When death has once dissolv\u2019d her mortal frame; Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep: Her angry ghost, arising from the deep, Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep."], "Who is Aeneas's mother?": [" Of various things discoursing as he pass\u2019d, Anchises hither bends his steps at last. Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn\u2019d to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII THE ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call\u2019d from thee, The nurse of great Aeneas\u2019 infancy. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia\u2019s plains; Thy name (\u2019tis all a ghost can have) remains. Now, when the prince her fun\u2019ral rites had paid, He plow\u2019d the Tyrrhene seas with sails display\u2019d. From land a gentle breeze arose by night, Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, And the sea trembled with her silver light. Now near the shelves of Circe\u2019s shores they run, (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) A dang\u2019rous coast: the goddess wastes her days In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, And cedar brands supply her father\u2019s light.", " My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne, And should, but he\u2019s a Sabine mother\u2019s son, And half a native; but, in you, combine A manly vigour, and a foreign line. Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way, Pursue the ready path to sov\u2019reign sway. The staff of my declining days, my son, Shall make your good or ill success his own; In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare, And serve the hard apprenticeship of war; Your matchless courage and your conduct view, And early shall begin t\u2019 admire and copy you. Besides, two hundred horse he shall command; Tho\u2019 few, a warlike and well-chosen band. These in my name are listed; and my son As many more has added in his own.\u201d Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest, With downcast eyes, their silent grief express\u2019d; Who, short of succours, and in deep despair, Shook at the dismal prospect of the war. But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud, To cheer her issue, thunder\u2019d thrice aloud; Thrice forky lightning flash\u2019d along the sky, And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear; And, in a heav\u2019n serene, refulgent arms appear: Redd\u2019ning the skies, and glitt\u2019ring all around, The temper\u2019d metals clash, and yield a silver sound. The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine; Aeneas only, conscious to the sign, Presag\u2019d th\u2019 event, and joyful view\u2019d, above, Th\u2019 accomplish\u2019d promise of the Queen of Love.", " Ascanius this observ\u2019d, and smiling said: \u201cSee, we devour the plates on which we fed.\u201d The speech had omen, that the Trojan race Should find repose, and this the time and place. Aeneas took the word, and thus replies, Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes: \u201cAll hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods! Behold the destin\u2019d place of your abodes! For thus Anchises prophesied of old, And this our fatal place of rest foretold: \u2018When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat, By famine forc\u2019d, your trenchers you shall eat, Then ease your weary Trojans will attend, And the long labours of your voyage end. Remember on that happy coast to build, And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.\u2019 This was that famine, this the fatal place Which ends the wand\u2019ring of our exil\u2019d race. Then, on tomorrow\u2019s dawn, your care employ, To search the land, and where the cities lie, And what the men; but give this day to joy. Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest, Call great Anchises to the genial feast: Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught; Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought.\u201d Thus having said, the hero bound his brows With leafy branches, then perform\u2019d his vows; Adoring first the genius of the place, Then Earth, the mother of the heav\u2019nly race, The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown, And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne, And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove, And last his sire below, and mother queen above.", " Mark how the shifting winds from west arise, And what collected night involves the skies! Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea, Much less against the tempest force their way. \u2019Tis fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. Not far from hence, if I observ\u2019d aright The southing of the stars, and polar light, Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores In safety we may reach with struggling oars.\u201d Aeneas then replied: \u201cToo sure I find We strive in vain against the seas and wind: Now shift your sails; what place can please me more Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, Whose hallow\u2019d earth Anchises\u2019 bones contains, And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?\u201d The course resolv\u2019d, before the western wind They scud amain, and make the port assign\u2019d. Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, Beheld the fleet descending on the land; And, not unmindful of his ancient race, Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, And held the hero in a strict embrace. Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, And either hand a pointed jav\u2019lin bore. His mother was a dame of Dardan blood; His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. He welcomes his returning friends ashore With plenteous country cates and homely store. Now, when the following morn had chas\u2019d away The flying stars, and light restor\u2019d the day, Aeneas call\u2019d the Trojan troops around, And thus bespoke them from a rising ground: \u201cOffspring of heav\u2019n, divine Dardanian race!"], "Why is Ascanius important?": [" The guard reliev\u2019d, the gen\u2019rous couple went To find the council at the royal tent. All creatures else forgot their daily care, And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate In nightly council for th\u2019 indanger\u2019d state. They vote a message to their absent chief, Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief. Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, Remote from clamour, and secure from foes. On their left arms their ample shields they bear, The right reclin\u2019d upon the bending spear. Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, And beg admission, eager to be heard: Th\u2019 affair important, not to be deferr\u2019d. Ascanius bids \u2019em be conducted in, Ord\u2019ring the more experienc\u2019d to begin. Then Nisus thus: \u201cYe fathers, lend your ears; Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. The foe, securely drench\u2019d in sleep and wine, Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; And where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies, Cov\u2019ring the plain, and curling to the skies, Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, Close by the sea, a passage we have spied, Which will our way to great Aeneas guide. Expect each hour to see him safe again, Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. Snatch we the lucky minute while we may; Nor can we be mistaken in the way; For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen The rising turrets, and the stream between, And know the winding course, with ev\u2019ry ford.\u201d He ceas\u2019d; and old Alethes took the word: \u201cOur country gods, in whom our trust we place, Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race, While we behold such dauntless worth appear In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.\u201d Then into tears of joy the father broke; Each in his longing arms by turns he took; Panted and paus\u2019d; and thus again he spoke: \u201cYe brave young men, what equal gifts can we, In recompense of such desert, decree?", " Majestically sad, he sits in state, And bids his envoys their success relate. When Venulus began, the murmuring sound Was hush\u2019d, and sacred silence reign\u2019d around. \u201cWe have,\u201d said he, \u201cperform\u2019d your high command, And pass\u2019d with peril a long tract of land: We reach\u2019d the place desir\u2019d; with wonder fill\u2019d, The Grecian tents and rising tow\u2019rs beheld. Great Diomede has compass\u2019d round with walls The city, which Argyripa he calls, From his own Argos nam\u2019d. We touch\u2019d, with joy, The royal hand that raz\u2019d unhappy Troy. When introduc\u2019d, our presents first we bring, Then crave an instant audience from the king. His leave obtain\u2019d, our native soil we name, And tell th\u2019 important cause for which we came. Attentively he heard us, while we spoke; Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look, Made this return: \u2018Ausonian race, of old Renown\u2019d for peace, and for an age of gold, What madness has your alter\u2019d minds possess\u2019d, To change for war hereditary rest, Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword, A needless ill your ancestors abhorr\u2019d? We\u2014for myself I speak, and all the name Of Grecians, who to Troy\u2019s destruction came, (Omitting those who were in battle slain, Or borne by rolling Simois to the main) Not one but suffer\u2019d, and too dearly bought The prize of honour which in arms he sought; Some doom\u2019d to death, and some in exile driv\u2019n. Outcasts, abandon\u2019d by the care of Heav\u2019n; So worn, so wretched, so despis\u2019d a crew, As ev\u2019n old Priam might with pity view.", " The steel thro\u2019 both his temples forc\u2019d the way: Extended on the ground, Numanus lay. \u201cGo now, vain boaster, and true valour scorn! The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.\u201d Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake The heav\u2019ns with shouting, and new vigour take. Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud: \u201cAdvance, illustrious youth, increase in fame, And wide from east to west extend thy name; Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe To thee a race of demigods below. This is the way to heav\u2019n: the pow\u2019rs divine From this beginning date the Julian line. To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, The conquer\u2019d war is due, and the vast world is theirs. Troy is too narrow for thy name.\u201d He said, And plunging downward shot his radiant head; Dispell\u2019d the breathing air, that broke his flight: Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. Old Butes\u2019 form he took, Anchises\u2019 squire, Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: \u201cSuffice it thee, thy father\u2019s worthy son, The warlike prize thou hast already won. The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. Now tempt the war no more.\u201d He said, and flew Obscure in air, and vanish\u2019d from their view.", " The greatest, sure, and best you can receive, The gods and your own conscious worth will give. The rest our grateful gen\u2019ral will bestow, And young Ascanius till his manhood owe.\u201d \u201cAnd I, whose welfare in my father lies,\u201d Ascanius adds, \u201cby the great deities, By my dear country, by my household gods, By hoary Vesta\u2019s rites and dark abodes, Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands; That and my faith I plight into your hands,) Make me but happy in his safe return, Whose wanted presence I can only mourn; Your common gift shall two large goblets be Of silver, wrought with curious imagery, And high emboss\u2019d, which, when old Priam reign\u2019d, My conqu\u2019ring sire at sack\u2019d Arisba gain\u2019d; And more, two tripods cast in antique mould, With two great talents of the finest gold; Beside a costly bowl, ingrav\u2019d with art, Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart. But, if in conquer\u2019d Italy we reign, When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain\u2014 Thou saw\u2019st the courser by proud Turnus press\u2019d: That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest, And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share: Twelve lab\u2019ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair All clad in rich attire, and train\u2019d with care; And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains, And a large portion of the king\u2019s domains. But thou, whose years are more to mine allied, No fate my vow\u2019d affection shall divide From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine; Take full possession; all my soul is thine."], "Who guides Aeneas through the underworld?": [" Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; A golden fillet binds his awful brows; His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen In manly presence, or in lofty mien. Now had they reach\u2019d the hills, and storm\u2019d the seat Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat. The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground; Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train, In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain, And a long chase in open view maintain. The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides, Spurs thro\u2019 the vale, and these and those outrides. His horse\u2019s flanks and sides are forc\u2019d to feel The clanking lash, and goring of the steel. Impatiently he views the feeble prey, Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way, And rather would the tusky boar attend, Or see the tawny lion downward bend. Meantime, the gath\u2019ring clouds obscure the skies: From pole to pole the forky lightning flies; The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours A wintry deluge down, and sounding show\u2019rs. The company, dispers\u2019d, to converts ride, And seek the homely cots, or mountain\u2019s hollow side. The rapid rains, descending from the hills, To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills. The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides, One common cavern in her bosom hides. Then first the trembling earth the signal gave, And flashing fires enlighten all the cave; Hell from below, and Juno from above, And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love.", " If neither Jove\u2019s nor Fate\u2019s decree withstand, Secure his passage to the Latian land.\u201d Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main: \u201cWhat may not Venus hope from Neptune\u2019s reign? My kingdom claims your birth; my late defence Of your indanger\u2019d fleet may claim your confidence. Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare How much your lov\u2019d Aeneas is my care. Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest. Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press\u2019d, And drove before him headlong on the plain, And dash\u2019d against the walls the trembling train; When floods were fill\u2019d with bodies of the slain; When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way, Stood up on ridges to behold the sea; New heaps came tumbling in, and chok\u2019d his way; When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds Of force unequal, and unequal gods; I spread a cloud before the victor\u2019s sight, Sustain\u2019d the vanquish\u2019d, and secur\u2019d his flight; Ev\u2019n then secur\u2019d him, when I sought with joy The vow\u2019d destruction of ungrateful Troy. My will\u2019s the same: fair goddess, fear no more, Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore; Their lives are giv\u2019n; one destin\u2019d head alone Shall perish, and for multitudes atone.\u201d Thus having arm\u2019d with hopes her anxious mind, His finny team Saturnian Neptune join\u2019d, Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws, And to the loosen\u2019d reins permits the laws. High on the waves his azure car he guides; Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides, And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.", " me!\u201d he cried\u2014\u201cturn all your swords alone On me\u2014the fact confess\u2019d, the fault my own. He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth: Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth! His only crime (if friendship can offend) Is too much love to his unhappy friend.\u201d Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides, Driv\u2019n with full force, had pierc\u2019d his tender sides. Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound Gush\u2019d out a purple stream, and stain\u2019d the ground. His snowy neck reclines upon his breast, Like a fair flow\u2019r by the keen share oppress\u2019d; Like a white poppy sinking on the plain, Whose heavy head is overcharg\u2019d with rain. Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow\u2019d, Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd. Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends: Borne back and bor\u2019d by his surrounding friends, Onward he press\u2019d, and kept him still in sight; Then whirl\u2019d aloft his sword with all his might: Th\u2019 unerring steel descended while he spoke, Pierc\u2019d his wide mouth, and thro\u2019 his weazon broke. Dying, he slew; and, stagg\u2019ring on the plain, With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain; Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell, Content, in death, to be reveng\u2019d so well. O happy friends! for, if my verse can give Immortal life, your fame shall ever live, Fix\u2019d as the Capitol\u2019s foundation lies, And spread, where\u2019er the Roman eagle flies! The conqu\u2019ring party first divide the prey, Then their slain leader to the camp convey.", " Thus in her crime her confidence she plac\u2019d, And with new treasons would redeem the past. What need I more? Into the room they ran, And meanly murder\u2019d a defenceless man. Ulysses, basely born, first led the way. Avenging pow\u2019rs! with justice if I pray, That fortune be their own another day! But answer you; and in your turn relate, What brought you, living, to the Stygian state: Driv\u2019n by the winds and errors of the sea, Or did you Heav\u2019n\u2019s superior doom obey? Or tell what other chance conducts your way, To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats, Tumults and torments of th\u2019 infernal seats.\u201d While thus in talk the flying hours they pass, The sun had finish\u2019d more than half his race: And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent The little time of stay which Heav\u2019n had lent; But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay: \u201cNight rushes down, and headlong drives the day: \u2019Tis here, in different paths, the way divides; The right to Pluto\u2019s golden palace guides; The left to that unhappy region tends, Which to the depth of Tartarus descends; The seat of night profound, and punish\u2019d fiends.\u201d Then thus Deiphobus: \u201cO sacred maid, Forbear to chide, and be your will obey\u2019d! Lo! to the secret shadows I retire, To pay my penance till my years expire. Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown\u2019d, And born to better fates than I have found.\u201d He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn\u2019d To secret shadows, and in silence mourn\u2019d."], "Which god primarily directs Aeneas's fate?": [" I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.\u201d BOOK III THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet with which he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace. From thence he directs his course to Delos and asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation. By a mistake of the oracle\u2019s answer, he settles in Crete. His household gods give him the true sense of the oracle in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy. He is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies. This is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him upon the Carthaginian coast. When Heav\u2019n had overturn\u2019d the Trojan state And Priam\u2019s throne, by too severe a fate; When ruin\u2019d Troy became the Grecians\u2019 prey, And Ilium\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs in ashes lay; Warn\u2019d by celestial omens, we retreat, To seek in foreign lands a happier seat. Near old Antandros, and at Ida\u2019s foot, The timber of the sacred groves we cut, And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find What place the gods for our repose assign\u2019d. Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, When old Anchises summon\u2019d all to sea: The crew my father and the Fates obey. With sighs and tears I leave my native shore, And empty fields, where Ilium stood before.", " Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries: \u201cThis is the time; enquire your destinies. He comes; behold the god!\u201d Thus while she said, (And shiv\u2019ring at the sacred entry stay\u2019d,) Her colour chang\u2019d; her face was not the same, And hollow groans from her deep spirit came. Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess\u2019d Her trembling limbs, and heav\u2019d her lab\u2019ring breast. Greater than humankind she seem\u2019d to look, And with an accent more than mortal spoke. Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll; When all the god came rushing on her soul. Swiftly she turn\u2019d, and, foaming as she spoke: \u201cWhy this delay?\u201d she cried; \u201cthe pow\u2019rs invoke! Thy pray\u2019rs alone can open this abode; Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god.\u201d She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear, O\u2019erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear. The prince himself, with awful dread possess\u2019d, His vows to great Apollo thus address\u2019d: \u201cIndulgent god, propitious pow\u2019r to Troy, Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy, Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart Pierc\u2019d the proud Grecian\u2019s only mortal part: Thus far, by fate\u2019s decrees and thy commands, Thro\u2019 ambient seas and thro\u2019 devouring sands, Our exil\u2019d crew has sought th\u2019 Ausonian ground; And now, at length, the flying coast is found. Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place, With fury has pursued her wand\u2019ring race. Here cease, ye pow\u2019rs, and let your vengeance end: Troy is no more, and can no more offend.", " Aeneas went Sad from the cave, and full of discontent, Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. Achates, the companion of his breast, Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress\u2019d. Walking, they talk\u2019d, and fruitlessly divin\u2019d What friend the priestess by those words design\u2019d. But soon they found an object to deplore: Misenus lay extended on the shore; Son of the God of Winds: none so renown\u2019d The warrior trumpet in the field to sound; With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms. He serv\u2019d great Hector, and was ever near, Not with his trumpet only, but his spear. But by Pelides\u2019 arms when Hector fell, He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well. Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more, He now provokes the sea gods from the shore; With envy Triton heard the martial sound, And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown\u2019d; Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand: The gazing crowd around the body stand. All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate, And hastens to perform the funeral state. In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; The basis broad below, and top advanc\u2019d in air. An ancient wood, fit for the work design\u2019d, (The shady covert of the salvage kind,) The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow\u2019ring pride Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.", " Then, with his god possess\u2019d, before the shrine, These words proceeded from his mouth divine: \u2018O goddess-born, (for Heav\u2019n\u2019s appointed will, With greater auspices of good than ill, Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs; Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,) Of many things some few I shall explain, Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main, And how at length the promis\u2019d shore to gain. The rest the fates from Helenus conceal, And Juno\u2019s angry pow\u2019r forbids to tell. First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh, Will far from your deluded wishes fly; Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy: For you must cruise along Sicilian shores, And stem the currents with your struggling oars; Then round th\u2019 Italian coast your navy steer; And, after this, to Circe\u2019s island veer; And, last, before your new foundations rise, Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies. Now mark the signs of future ease and rest, And bear them safely treasur\u2019d in thy breast. When, in the shady shelter of a wood, And near the margin of a gentle flood, Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground, With thirty sucking young encompass\u2019d round; The dam and offspring white as falling snow: These on thy city shall their name bestow, And there shall end thy labours and thy woe. Nor let the threaten\u2019d famine fright thy mind, For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find. Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent, Which fronts from far th\u2019 Epirian continent: Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess\u2019d; The salvage Locrians here the shores infest; There fierce Idomeneus his city builds, And guards with arms the Salentinian fields; And on the mountain\u2019s brow Petilia stands, Which Philoctetes with his troops commands."], "What city has just been destroyed at the opening of the poem?": [" Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " Now is but death, or flight; disarm\u2019d he flies, When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies. Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join\u2019d, Hurrying to war, disorder\u2019d in his mind, Snatch\u2019d the first weapon which his haste could find. \u2019Twas not the fated sword his father bore, But that his charioteer Metiscus wore. This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held; But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield, The mortal-temper\u2019d steel deceiv\u2019d his hand: The shiver\u2019d fragments shone amid the sand. Surpris\u2019d with fear, he fled along the field, And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel\u2019d; For here the Trojan troops the list surround, And there the pass is clos\u2019d with pools and marshy ground. Aeneas hastens, tho\u2019 with heavier pace\u2014 His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase, And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse\u2014 Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues. Thus, when a fearful stag is clos\u2019d around With crimson toils, or in a river found, High on the bank the deep-mouth\u2019d hound appears, Still opening, following still, where\u2019er he steers; The persecuted creature, to and fro, Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe: Steep is th\u2019 ascent, and, if he gains the land, The purple death is pitch\u2019d along the strand. His eager foe, determin\u2019d to the chase, Stretch\u2019d at his length, gains ground at ev\u2019ry pace; Now to his beamy head he makes his way, And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey: Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear; He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air: The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries; The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.", " From this ill-omen\u2019d hour in time arose Debate and death, and all succeeding woes. The queen, whom sense of honour could not move, No longer made a secret of her love, But call\u2019d it marriage, by that specious name To veil the crime and sanctify the shame. The loud report thro\u2019 Libyan cities goes. Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows: Swift from the first; and ev\u2019ry moment brings New vigour to her flights, new pinions to her wings. Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size; Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies. Inrag\u2019d against the gods, revengeful Earth Produc\u2019d her last of the Titanian birth. Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste: A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast. As many plumes as raise her lofty flight, So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight; Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong, And ev\u2019ry mouth is furnish\u2019d with a tongue, And round with list\u2019ning ears the flying plague is hung. She fills the peaceful universe with cries; No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes; By day, from lofty tow\u2019rs her head she shews, And spreads thro\u2019 trembling crowds disastrous news; With court informers haunts, and royal spies; Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with lies. Talk is her business, and her chief delight To tell of prodigies and cause affright. She fills the people\u2019s ears with Dido\u2019s name, Who, lost to honour and the sense of shame, Admits into her throne and nuptial bed A wand\u2019ring guest, who from his country fled: Whole days with him she passes in delights, And wastes in luxury long winter nights, Forgetful of her fame and royal trust, Dissolv\u2019d in ease, abandon\u2019d to her lust.", " Aeneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years\u2019 siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he met with in defence of it. At last, having been before advised by Hector\u2019s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him. All were attentive to the godlike man, When from his lofty couch he thus began: \u201cGreat queen, what you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: An empire from its old foundations rent, And ev\u2019ry woe the Trojans underwent; A peopled city made a desert place; All that I saw, and part of which I was: Not ev\u2019n the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. And now the latter watch of wasting night, And setting stars, to kindly rest invite; But, since you take such int\u2019rest in our woe, And Troy\u2019s disastrous end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell."], "Whom does Aeneas meet and fall in love with in Carthage?": [" Jupiter despatches Mercury to Aeneas, to warn him from Carthage. Aeneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister\u2019s entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But anxious cares already seiz\u2019d the queen: She fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero\u2019s valour, acts, and birth inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, Improve the passion, and increase the smart. Now, when the purple morn had chas\u2019d away The dewy shadows, and restor\u2019d the day, Her sister first with early care she sought, And thus in mournful accents eas\u2019d her thought: \u201cMy dearest Anna, what new dreams affright My lab\u2019ring soul! what visions of the night Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast With strange ideas of our Trojan guest! His worth, his actions, and majestic air, A man descended from the gods declare. Fear ever argues a degenerate kind; His birth is well asserted by his mind. Then, what he suffer\u2019d, when by Fate betray\u2019d! What brave attempts for falling Troy he made! Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, That, were I not resolv\u2019d against the yoke Of hapless marriage, never to be curst With second love, so fatal was my first, To this one error I might yield again; For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain, This only man is able to subvert The fix\u2019d foundations of my stubborn heart.", " They seize a fleet, which ready rigg\u2019d they find; Nor is Pygmalion\u2019s treasure left behind. The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea With prosp\u2019rous winds; a woman leads the way. I know not, if by stress of weather driv\u2019n, Or was their fatal course dispos\u2019d by Heav\u2019n; At last they landed, where from far your eyes May view the turrets of new Carthage rise; There bought a space of ground, which Byrsa call\u2019d, From the bull\u2019s hide, they first inclos\u2019d, and wall\u2019d. But whence are you? what country claims your birth? What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?\u201d To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes, And deeply sighing, thus her son replies: \u201cCould you with patience hear, or I relate, O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate! Thro\u2019 such a train of woes if I should run, The day would sooner than the tale be done! From ancient Troy, by force expell\u2019d, we came, If you by chance have heard the Trojan name. On various seas by various tempests toss\u2019d, At length we landed on your Libyan coast. The good Aeneas am I call\u2019d, a name, While Fortune favour\u2019d, not unknown to fame. My household gods, companions of my woes, With pious care I rescued from our foes. To fruitful Italy my course was bent; And from the King of Heav\u2019n is my descent. With twice ten sail I cross\u2019d the Phrygian sea; Fate and my mother goddess led my way. Scarce sev\u2019n, the thin remainders of my fleet, From storms preserv\u2019d, within your harbour meet.", " And now this other Paris, with his train Of conquer\u2019d cowards, must in Afric reign! (Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess, Their locks with oil perfum\u2019d, their Lydian dress.) He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame; And I, rejected I, adore an empty name.\u201d His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr\u2019d, And held his altar\u2019s horns. The mighty Thund\u2019rer heard; Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown\u2019d, Lost in their loves, insensible of shame, And both forgetful of their better fame. He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends, By whom his menacing command he sends: \u201cGo, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky; Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly: There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days In slothful riot and inglorious ease, Nor minds the future city, giv\u2019n by fate. To him this message from my mouth relate: \u2018Not so fair Venus hop\u2019d, when twice she won Thy life with pray\u2019rs, nor promis\u2019d such a son. Hers was a hero, destin\u2019d to command A martial race, and rule the Latian land, Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw, And on the conquer\u2019d world impose the law.\u2019 If glory cannot move a mind so mean, Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean, Yet why should he defraud his son of fame, And grudge the Romans their immortal name! What are his vain designs! what hopes he more From his long ling\u2019ring on a hostile shore, Regardless to redeem his honour lost, And for his race to gain th\u2019 Ausonian coast!", " O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate; What goddess was provok\u2019d, and whence her hate; For what offence the Queen of Heav\u2019n began To persecute so brave, so just a man; Involv\u2019d his anxious life in endless cares, Expos\u2019d to wants, and hurried into wars! Can heav\u2019nly minds such high resentment show, Or exercise their spite in human woe? Against the Tiber\u2019s mouth, but far away, An ancient town was seated on the sea; A Tyrian colony; the people made Stout for the war, and studious of their trade: Carthage the name; belov\u2019d by Juno more Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore. Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav\u2019n were kind, The seat of awful empire she design\u2019d. Yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly, (Long cited by the people of the sky,) That times to come should see the Trojan race Her Carthage ruin, and her tow\u2019rs deface; Nor thus confin\u2019d, the yoke of sov\u2019reign sway Should on the necks of all the nations lay. She ponder\u2019d this, and fear\u2019d it was in fate; Nor could forget the war she wag\u2019d of late For conqu\u2019ring Greece against the Trojan state. Besides, long causes working in her mind, And secret seeds of envy, lay behind; Deep graven in her heart the doom remain\u2019d Of partial Paris, and her form disdain\u2019d; The grace bestow\u2019d on ravish\u2019d Ganymed, Electra\u2019s glories, and her injur\u2019d bed. Each was a cause alone; and all combin\u2019d To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind. For this, far distant from the Latian coast She drove the remnants of the Trojan host; And sev\u2019n long years th\u2019 unhappy wand\u2019ring train Were toss\u2019d by storms, and scatter\u2019d thro\u2019 the main."], "Where does Aeneas go after arriving in Italy?": [" Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince New ramparts raising for the town\u2019s defence. A purple scarf, with gold embroider\u2019d o\u2019er, (Queen Dido\u2019s gift,) about his waist he wore; A sword, with glitt\u2019ring gems diversified, For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side. Then thus, with winged words, the god began, Resuming his own shape: \u201cDegenerate man, Thou woman\u2019s property, what mak\u2019st thou here, These foreign walls and Tyrian tow\u2019rs to rear, Forgetful of thy own? All-pow\u2019rful Jove, Who sways the world below and heav\u2019n above, Has sent me down with this severe command: What means thy ling\u2019ring in the Libyan land? If glory cannot move a mind so mean, Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean, Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir: The promis\u2019d crown let young Ascanius wear, To whom th\u2019 Ausonian scepter, and the state Of Rome\u2019s imperial name is ow\u2019d by fate.\u201d So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight, Involv\u2019d in clouds, and vanish\u2019d out of sight. The pious prince was seiz\u2019d with sudden fear; Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair. Revolving in his mind the stern command, He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land. What should he say? or how should he begin? What course, alas! remains to steer between Th\u2019 offended lover and the pow\u2019rful queen? This way and that he turns his anxious mind, And all expedients tries, and none can find. Fix\u2019d on the deed, but doubtful of the means, After long thought, to this advice he leans: Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair The fleet, and ship their men with silent care; Some plausible pretence he bids them find, To colour what in secret he design\u2019d.", " Ev\u2019n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain: The body, not the mind; nor can control Th\u2019 immortal vigour, or abate the soul. Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray: We live by plunder, and delight in prey. Your vests embroider\u2019d with rich purple shine; In sloth you glory, and in dances join. Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride Your turbans underneath your chins are tied. Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again! Go, less than women, in the shapes of men! Go, mix\u2019d with eunuchs, in the Mother\u2019s rites, Where with unequal sound the flute invites; Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida\u2019s shade: Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!\u201d This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear With patience, or a vow\u2019d revenge forbear. At the full stretch of both his hands he drew, And almost join\u2019d the horns of the tough yew. But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood, And thus with lifted hands invok\u2019d the god: \u201cMy first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed! An annual off\u2019ring in thy grove shall bleed; A snow-white steer, before thy altar led, Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head, Butts with his threat\u2019ning brows, and bellowing stands, And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands.\u201d Jove bow\u2019d the heav\u2019ns, and lent a gracious ear, And thunder\u2019d on the left, amidst the clear. Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies The feather\u2019d death, and hisses thro\u2019 the skies.", " Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, Whose mighty trunk had better grac\u2019d the wood, If Pallas had arriv\u2019d, with equal length Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd\u2019st in vain? Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, And, after Pallas\u2019 death, live ling\u2019ring on, \u2019Tis to behold his vengeance for my son. I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead. My son and I expect it from his hand; \u2019Tis all that he can give, or we demand. Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, To greet my Pallas with such news below.\u201d The morn had now dispell\u2019d the shades of night, Restoring toils, when she restor\u2019d the light. The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command To raise the piles along the winding strand. Their friends convey the dead fun\u2019ral fires; Black smould\u2019ring smoke from the green wood expires; The light of heav\u2019n is chok\u2019d, and the new day retires. Then thrice around the kindled piles they go (For ancient custom had ordain\u2019d it so) Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw The spoils, in battle taken from the foe: Helms, bits emboss\u2019d, and swords of shining steel; One casts a target, one a chariot wheel; Some to their fellows their own arms restore: The falchions which in luckless fight they bore, Their bucklers pierc\u2019d, their darts bestow\u2019d in vain, And shiver\u2019d lances gather\u2019d from the plain.", " Upon this, Aeneas, by the advice of one of his generals, and a vision of his father, builds a city for the women, old men, and others, who were either unfit for war, or weary of the voyage, and sails for Italy. Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting only his pilot Palinurus, who was unfortunately lost. Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat\u2019ry way, Fix\u2019d on his voyage, thro\u2019 the curling sea; Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze. The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind The fate of Dido from the fire divin\u2019d; He knew the stormy souls of womankind, What secret springs their eager passions move, How capable of death for injur\u2019d love. Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw; Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw. Now seas and skies their prospect only bound; An empty space above, a floating field around. But soon the heav\u2019ns with shadows were o\u2019erspread; A swelling cloud hung hov\u2019ring o\u2019er their head: Livid it look\u2019d, the threat\u2019ning of a storm: Then night and horror ocean\u2019s face deform. The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud: \u201cWhat gusts of weather from that gath\u2019ring cloud My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.\u201d The frighted crew perform the task assign\u2019d. Then, to his fearless chief: \u201cNot Heav\u2019n,\u201d said he, \u201cTho\u2019 Jove himself should promise Italy, Can stem the torrent of this raging sea."], "Which city is Aeneas destined to found?": [" Aeneas went Sad from the cave, and full of discontent, Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. Achates, the companion of his breast, Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress\u2019d. Walking, they talk\u2019d, and fruitlessly divin\u2019d What friend the priestess by those words design\u2019d. But soon they found an object to deplore: Misenus lay extended on the shore; Son of the God of Winds: none so renown\u2019d The warrior trumpet in the field to sound; With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms. He serv\u2019d great Hector, and was ever near, Not with his trumpet only, but his spear. But by Pelides\u2019 arms when Hector fell, He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well. Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more, He now provokes the sea gods from the shore; With envy Triton heard the martial sound, And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown\u2019d; Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand: The gazing crowd around the body stand. All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate, And hastens to perform the funeral state. In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; The basis broad below, and top advanc\u2019d in air. An ancient wood, fit for the work design\u2019d, (The shady covert of the salvage kind,) The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow\u2019ring pride Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.", " Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " Aeneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years\u2019 siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he met with in defence of it. At last, having been before advised by Hector\u2019s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him. All were attentive to the godlike man, When from his lofty couch he thus began: \u201cGreat queen, what you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: An empire from its old foundations rent, And ev\u2019ry woe the Trojans underwent; A peopled city made a desert place; All that I saw, and part of which I was: Not ev\u2019n the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. And now the latter watch of wasting night, And setting stars, to kindly rest invite; But, since you take such int\u2019rest in our woe, And Troy\u2019s disastrous end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell.", " And here the tam\u2019d Euphrates humbly glides, And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; The Danes\u2019 unconquer\u2019d offspring march behind, And Morini, the last of humankind. These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, By Vulcan labour\u2019d, and by Venus brought, With joy and wonder fill the hero\u2019s thought. Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. BOOK IX THE ARGUMENT. Turnus takes advantage of Aeneas\u2019s absence, fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea nymphs,) and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduced to the last extremities, send Ninus and Euryalus to recall Aeneas; which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and the conclusion of their adventure. While these affairs in distant places pass\u2019d, The various Iris Juno sends with haste, To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, The secret shade of his great grandsire sought. Retir\u2019d alone she found the daring man, And op\u2019d her rosy lips, and thus began: \u201cWhat none of all the gods could grant thy vows, That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. Aeneas, gone to seek th\u2019 Arcadian prince, Has left the Trojan camp without defence; And, short of succours there, employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs; Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.\u201d This said, on equal wings she pois\u2019d her weight, And form\u2019d a radiant rainbow in her flight."], "Who is Aeneas's primary enemy in Italy?": [" Upon this, Aeneas, by the advice of one of his generals, and a vision of his father, builds a city for the women, old men, and others, who were either unfit for war, or weary of the voyage, and sails for Italy. Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting only his pilot Palinurus, who was unfortunately lost. Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat\u2019ry way, Fix\u2019d on his voyage, thro\u2019 the curling sea; Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze.

Meantime the mother goddess, crown\u2019d with charms, Breaks thro\u2019 the clouds, and brings the fated arms. Within a winding vale she finds her son, On the cool river\u2019s banks, retir\u2019d alone. She shews her heav\u2019nly form without disguise, And gives herself to his desiring eyes. \u201cBehold,\u201d she said, \u201cperform\u2019d in ev\u2019ry part, My promise made, and Vulcan\u2019s labour\u2019d art. Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy, And haughty Turnus to the field defy.\u201d She said; and, having first her son embrac\u2019d, The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac\u2019d, Proud of the gift, he roll\u2019d his greedy sight Around the work, and gaz\u2019d with vast delight. He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires: His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold, One keen with temper\u2019d steel, one stiff with gold: Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright; So shines a cloud, when edg\u2019d with adverse light. He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try The plated cuishes on his manly thigh; But most admires the shield\u2019s mysterious mould, And Roman triumphs rising on the gold: For these, emboss\u2019d, the heav\u2019nly smith had wrought (Not in the rolls of future fate untaught) The wars in order, and the race divine Of warriors issuing from the Julian line. The cave of Mars was dress\u2019d with mossy greens: There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.", " He heav\u2019d it at a lift, and, pois\u2019d on high, Ran stagg\u2019ring on against his enemy, But so disorder\u2019d, that he scarcely knew His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw. His knocking knees are bent beneath the load, And shiv\u2019ring cold congeals his vital blood. The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short For want of vigour, mocks his vain effort. And as, when heavy sleep has clos\u2019d the sight, The sickly fancy labours in the night; We seem to run; and, destitute of force, Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course: In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry; The nerves, unbrac\u2019d, their usual strength deny; And on the tongue the falt\u2019ring accents die: So Turnus far\u2019d; whatever means he tried, All force of arms and points of art employ\u2019d, The Fury flew athwart, and made th\u2019 endeavor void. A thousand various thoughts his soul confound; He star\u2019d about, nor aid nor issue found; His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround. Once more he pauses, and looks out again, And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain. Trembling he views the thund\u2019ring chief advance, And brandishing aloft the deadly lance: Amaz\u2019d he cow\u2019rs beneath his conqu\u2019ring foe, Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow. Astonish\u2019d while he stands, and fix\u2019d with fear, Aim\u2019d at his shield he sees th\u2019 impending spear. The hero measur\u2019d first, with narrow view, The destin\u2019d mark; and, rising as he threw, With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.", " Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames His tardy troops, and, calling by their names, Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats To lay in ashes, if they dare supply With arms or aid his vanquish\u2019d enemy: Thus menacing, he still pursues the course, With vigour, tho\u2019 diminish\u2019d of his force. Ten times already round the listed place One chief had fled, and t\u2019 other giv\u2019n the chase: No trivial prize is play\u2019d; for on the life Or death of Turnus now depends the strife. Within the space, an olive tree had stood, A sacred shade, a venerable wood, For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins\u2019 guardian god. Here hung the vests, and tablets were engrav\u2019d, Of sinking mariners from shipwreck sav\u2019d. With heedless hands the Trojans fell\u2019d the tree, To make the ground enclos\u2019d for combat free. Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance, Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance; Then stoop\u2019d, and tugg\u2019d with force immense, to free Th\u2019 incumber\u2019d spear from the tenacious tree; That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain, His flying weapon might from far attain. Confus\u2019d with fear, bereft of human aid, Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray\u2019d: \u201cO Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth, Where I thy foster son receiv\u2019d my birth, Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand Your plant has honour\u2019d, which your foes profan\u2019d, Propitious hear my pious pray\u2019r!\u201d He said, Nor with successless vows invok\u2019d their aid."], "Why don't the actions of the lesser gods affect the outcome of Aeneas's life?": [" The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force. Then Venulus to Diomede they send, To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, Declare the common danger, and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm: \u201cAeneas, landed on the Latian coast, With banish\u2019d gods, and with a baffled host, Yet now aspir\u2019d to conquest of the state, And claim\u2019d a title from the gods and fate; What num\u2019rous nations in his quarrel came, And how they spread his formidable name. What he design\u2019d, what mischief might arise, If fortune favour\u2019d his first enterprise, Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, And common interest, was involv\u2019d in theirs.\u201d While Turnus and th\u2019 allies thus urge the war, The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.", " BOOK X THE ARGUMENT. Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party. At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. Then is your time for faction and debate, For partial favour, and permitted hate. Let now your immature dissension cease; Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.\u201d Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; But lovely Venus thus replies at large: \u201cO pow\u2019r immense, eternal energy, (For to what else protection can we fly?)", " Soon as the royal youth appear\u2019d in view, He sent his voice before him as he flew: \u201cWhat madness moves you, matrons, to destroy The last remainders of unhappy Troy! Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn, And on your friends your fatal fury turn. Behold your own Ascanius!\u201d While he said, He drew his glitt\u2019ring helmet from his head, In which the youths to sportful arms he led. By this, Aeneas and his train appear; And now the women, seiz\u2019d with shame and fear, Dispers\u2019d, to woods and caverns take their flight, Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; Their friends acknowledge, and their error find, And shake the goddess from their alter\u2019d mind. Not so the raging fires their fury cease, But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, Work on their way amid the smould\u2019ring tow, Sure in destruction, but in motion slow. The silent plague thro\u2019 the green timber eats, And vomits out a tardy flame by fits. Down to the keels, and upward to the sails, The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; Nor buckets pour\u2019d, nor strength of human hand, Can the victorious element withstand. The pious hero rends his robe, and throws To heav\u2019n his hands, and with his hands his vows. \u201cO Jove,\u201d he cried, \u201cif pray\u2019rs can yet have place; If thou abhorr\u2019st not all the Dardan race; If any spark of pity still remain; If gods are gods, and not invok\u2019d in vain; Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!", " Straight, o\u2019er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes, And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes. Then, of itself, unfolds th\u2019 eternal door; With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar. You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post. More formidable Hydra stands within, Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin. The gaping gulf low to the centre lies, And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies. The rivals of the gods, the Titan race, Here, sing\u2019d with lightning, roll within th\u2019 unfathom\u2019d space. Here lie th\u2019 Alaean twins, (I saw them both,) Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth, Who dar\u2019d in fight the Thund\u2019rer to defy, Affect his heav\u2019n, and force him from the sky. Salmoneus, suff\u2019ring cruel pains, I found, For emulating Jove; the rattling sound Of mimic thunder, and the glitt\u2019ring blaze Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays. Thro\u2019 Elis and the Grecian towns he flew; Th\u2019 audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew: He wav\u2019d a torch aloft, and, madly vain, Sought godlike worship from a servile train. Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass O\u2019er hollow arches of resounding brass, To rival thunder in its rapid course, And imitate inimitable force! But he, the King of Heav\u2019n, obscure on high, Bar\u2019d his red arm, and, launching from the sky His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke, Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook."], "What is the role of homeland in The Aeneid?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AENEID *** Produced by Anonymous Volunteers and David Widger THE AENEID by Virgil Translated by John Dryden Contents BOOK I BOOK II BOOK III BOOK IV BOOK V BOOK VI BOOK VII BOOK VIII BOOK IX BOOK X BOOK XI BOOK XII BOOK I THE ARGUMENT. The Trojans, after a seven years\u2019 voyage, set sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Aeolus raises at the request of Juno. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune drives off the winds, and calms the sea. Aeneas, with his own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her son\u2019s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians. Aeneas, going out to discover the country, meets his mother in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by device of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some discourse with him, desires the history of his adventures since the siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following books. Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc\u2019d by fate, And haughty Juno\u2019s unrelenting hate, Expell\u2019d and exil\u2019d, left the Trojan shore. Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore, And in the doubtful war, before he won The Latian realm, and built the destin\u2019d town; His banish\u2019d gods restor\u2019d to rites divine, And settled sure succession in his line, From whence the race of Alban fathers come, And the long glories of majestic Rome."], "Why does Aeneas decide to kill Turnus at the end of the poem?": [" Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death. When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, Their armies broken, and their courage quell\u2019d, Himself become the mark of public spite, His honour question\u2019d for the promis\u2019d fight; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress\u2019d, The more his fury boil\u2019d within his breast: He rous\u2019d his vigour for the last debate, And rais\u2019d his haughty soul to meet his fate. As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; But, if the pointed jav\u2019lin pierce his side, The lordly beast returns with double pride: He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, Thro\u2019 his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, At length approach\u2019d the king, and thus began: \u201cNo more excuses or delays: I stand In arms prepar\u2019d to combat, hand to hand, This base deserter of his native land.", " What god can tell, what numbers can display, The various labours of that fatal day; What chiefs and champions fell on either side, In combat slain, or by what deaths they died; Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill\u2019d; Who shar\u2019d the fame and fortune of the field! Jove, could\u2019st thou view, and not avert thy sight, Two jarring nations join\u2019d in cruel fight, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found, Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground; Betwixt his ribs the jav\u2019lin drove so just, It reach\u2019d his heart, nor needs a second thrust. Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail\u2019d Diores, and in equal fight prevail\u2019d. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, Whom without respite at one charge he slew: Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress\u2019d, And sad Onythes, added to the rest, Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore. Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore, And from Apollo\u2019s fane to battle sent, O\u2019erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent. Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill\u2019d, Who long had shunn\u2019d the dangers of the field: On Lerna\u2019s lake a silent life he led, And with his nets and angle earn\u2019d his bread; Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew, But wisely from th\u2019 infectious world withdrew: Poor was his house; his father\u2019s painful hand Discharg\u2019d his rent, and plow\u2019d another\u2019s land.", " Twice vanquish\u2019d while in bloody fields we strive, Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive: The rolling flood runs warm with human gore; The bones of Latians blanch the neighb\u2019ring shore. Why put I not an end to this debate, Still unresolv\u2019d, and still a slave to fate? If Turnus\u2019 death a lasting peace can give, Why should I not procure it whilst you live? Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray, What would my kinsmen, the Rutulians, say? And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav\u2019n defend!) How curse the cause which hasten\u2019d to his end The daughter\u2019s lover and the father\u2019s friend? Weigh in your mind the various chance of war; Pity your parent\u2019s age, and ease his care.\u201d Such balmy words he pour\u2019d, but all in vain: The proffer\u2019d med\u2019cine but provok\u2019d the pain. The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief, With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief: \u201cThe care, O best of fathers, which you take For my concerns, at my desire forsake. Permit me not to languish out my days, But make the best exchange of life for praise. This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize; And the blood follows, where the weapon flies. His goddess mother is not near, to shroud The flying coward with an empty cloud.\u201d But now the queen, who fear\u2019d for Turnus\u2019 life, And loath\u2019d the hard conditions of the strife, Held him by force; and, dying in his death, In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath: \u201cO Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears, And whate\u2019er price Amata\u2019s honour bears Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope, My sickly mind\u2019s repose, my sinking age\u2019s prop; Since on the safety of thy life alone Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne: Refuse me not this one, this only pray\u2019r, To waive the combat, and pursue the war.", " Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone; We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne: A base ignoble crowd, without a name, Unwept, unworthy, of the fun\u2019ral flame, By duty bound to forfeit each his life, That Turnus may possess a royal wife. Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew Should share such triumphs, and detain from you The post of honour, your undoubted due. Rather alone your matchless force employ, To merit what alone you must enjoy.\u201d These words, so full of malice mix\u2019d with art, Inflam\u2019d with rage the youthful hero\u2019s heart. Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast, He heav\u2019d for wind, and thus his wrath express\u2019d: \u201cYou, Drances, never want a stream of words, Then, when the public need requires our swords. First in the council hall to steer the state, And ever foremost in a tongue-debate, While our strong walls secure us from the foe, Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow: But let the potent orator declaim, And with the brand of coward blot my name; Free leave is giv\u2019n him, when his fatal hand Has cover\u2019d with more corps the sanguine strand, And high as mine his tow\u2019ring trophies stand. If any doubt remains, who dares the most, Let us decide it at the Trojan\u2019s cost, And issue both abreast, where honour calls\u2014 (Foes are not far to seek without the walls) Unless his noisy tongue can only fight, And feet were giv\u2019n him but to speed his flight. I beaten from the field?"], "What is the golden bough a sign of?": [" Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know Their process, or the forms of law below. Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along, And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung Unhappy Theseus, doom\u2019d for ever there, Is fix\u2019d by fate on his eternal chair; And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries (Could warning make the world more just or wise): \u2018Learn righteousness, and dread th\u2019 avenging deities.\u2019 To tyrants others have their country sold, Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold; Some have old laws repeal\u2019d, new statutes made, Not as the people pleas\u2019d, but as they paid; With incest some their daughters\u2019 bed profan\u2019d: All dar\u2019d the worst of ills, and, what they dar\u2019d, attain\u2019d. Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, And throats of brass, inspir\u2019d with iron lungs, I could not half those horrid crimes repeat, Nor half the punishments those crimes have met. But let us haste our voyage to pursue: The walls of Pluto\u2019s palace are in view; The gate, and iron arch above it, stands On anvils labour\u2019d by the Cyclops\u2019 hands. Before our farther way the Fates allow, Here must we fix on high the golden bough.\u201d She said, and thro\u2019 the gloomy shades they pass\u2019d, And chose the middle path. Arriv\u2019d at last, The prince with living water sprinkled o\u2019er His limbs and body; then approach\u2019d the door, Possess\u2019d the porch, and on the front above He fix\u2019d the fatal bough requir\u2019d by Pluto\u2019s love.", " I will myself the bridal bed prepare, If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there: So shall their loves be crown\u2019d with due delights, And Hymen shall be present at the rites.\u201d The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles At her vain project, and discover\u2019d wiles. The rosy morn was risen from the main, And horns and hounds awake the princely train: They issue early thro\u2019 the city gate, Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait, With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse. The Tyrian peers and officers of state For the slow queen in antechambers wait; Her lofty courser, in the court below, Who his majestic rider seems to know, Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground, And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around. The queen at length appears; on either hand The brawny guards in martial order stand. A flow\u2019r\u2019d simar with golden fringe she wore, And at her back a golden quiver bore; Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains, A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains. Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase. But far above the rest in beauty shines The great Aeneas, the troop he joins; Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost Of wint\u2019ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast, When to his native Delos he resorts, Ordains the dances, and renews the sports; Where painted Scythians, mix\u2019d with Cretan bands, Before the joyful altars join their hands: Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below The merry madness of the sacred show.", " Such is their toil, and such their busy pains, As exercise the bees in flow\u2019ry plains, When winter past, and summer scarce begun, Invites them forth to labour in the sun; Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense; Some at the gate stand ready to receive The golden burthen, and their friends relieve; All with united force, combine to drive The lazy drones from the laborious hive: With envy stung, they view each other\u2019s deeds; The fragrant work with diligence proceeds. \u201cThrice happy you, whose walls already rise!\u201d Aeneas said, and view\u2019d, with lifted eyes, Their lofty tow\u2019rs; then, ent\u2019ring at the gate, Conceal\u2019d in clouds (prodigious to relate) He mix\u2019d, unmark\u2019d, among the busy throng, Borne by the tide, and pass\u2019d unseen along. Full in the centre of the town there stood, Thick set with trees, a venerable wood. The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground, And digging here, a prosp\u2019rous omen found: From under earth a courser\u2019s head they drew, Their growth and future fortune to foreshew. This fated sign their foundress Juno gave, Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave. Sidonian Dido here with solemn state Did Juno\u2019s temple build, and consecrate, Enrich\u2019d with gifts, and with a golden shrine; But more the goddess made the place divine. On brazen steps the marble threshold rose, And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose: The rafters are with brazen cov\u2019rings crown\u2019d; The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.", " Huge trunks of trees, fell\u2019d from the steepy crown Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down. Arm\u2019d like the rest the Trojan prince appears, And by his pious labour urges theirs. Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind The ways to compass what his wish design\u2019d, He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove, And then with vows implor\u2019d the Queen of Love: \u201cO may thy pow\u2019r, propitious still to me, Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree, In this deep forest; since the Sibyl\u2019s breath Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus\u2019 death.\u201d Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight, Two doves, descending from their airy flight, Secure upon the grassy plain alight. He knew his mother\u2019s birds; and thus he pray\u2019d: \u201cBe you my guides, with your auspicious aid, And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, Whose glitt\u2019ring shadow gilds the sacred ground. And thou, great parent, with celestial care, In this distress be present to my pray\u2019r!\u201d Thus having said, he stopp\u2019d with watchful sight, Observing still the motions of their flight, What course they took, what happy signs they shew. They fed, and, flutt\u2019ring, by degrees withdrew Still farther from the place, but still in view: Hopping and flying, thus they led him on To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun They wing\u2019d their flight aloft; then, stooping low, Perch\u2019d on the double tree that bears the golden bough. Thro\u2019 the green leafs the glitt\u2019ring shadows glow; As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe, Where the proud mother views her precious brood, And happier branches, which she never sow\u2019d."], "Why does Aeneas take the hearth gods with him when he leaves Troy?": [" \u201cDescending thence, I scape thro\u2019 foes and fire: Before the goddess, foes and flames retire. Arriv\u2019d at home, he, for whose only sake, Or most for his, such toils I undertake, The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight, I purpos\u2019d to secure on Ida\u2019s height, Refus\u2019d the journey, resolute to die And add his fun\u2019rals to the fate of Troy, Rather than exile and old age sustain. \u2018Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev\u2019ry vein. Had Heav\u2019n decreed that I should life enjoy, Heav\u2019n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. \u2019Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, And give this useless corpse a long adieu. These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; At least the pitying foes will aid my death, To take my spoils, and leave my body bare: As for my sepulcher, let Heav\u2019n take care. \u2019Tis long since I, for my celestial wife Loath\u2019d by the gods, have dragg\u2019d a ling\u2019ring life; Since ev\u2019ry hour and moment I expire, Blasted from heav\u2019n by Jove\u2019s avenging fire.\u2019 This oft repeated, he stood fix\u2019d to die: Myself, my wife, my son, my family, Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry. \u2018What, will he still persist, on death resolve, And in his ruin all his house involve!\u2019 He still persists his reasons to maintain; Our pray\u2019rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. \u201cUrg\u2019d by despair, again I go to try The fate of arms, resolv\u2019d in fight to die: \u2018What hope remains, but what my death must give?", " Aeneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years\u2019 siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he met with in defence of it. At last, having been before advised by Hector\u2019s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand, his wife following behind. When he comes to the place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed for him. All were attentive to the godlike man, When from his lofty couch he thus began: \u201cGreat queen, what you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: An empire from its old foundations rent, And ev\u2019ry woe the Trojans underwent; A peopled city made a desert place; All that I saw, and part of which I was: Not ev\u2019n the hardest of our foes could hear, Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. And now the latter watch of wasting night, And setting stars, to kindly rest invite; But, since you take such int\u2019rest in our woe, And Troy\u2019s disastrous end desire to know, I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell.", " \u201cPerhaps you may of Priam\u2019s fate enquire. He, when he saw his regal town on fire, His ruin\u2019d palace, and his ent\u2019ring foes, On ev\u2019ry side inevitable woes, In arms, disus\u2019d, invests his limbs, decay\u2019d, Like them, with age; a late and useless aid. His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain; Loaded, not arm\u2019d, he creeps along with pain, Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain! Uncover\u2019d but by heav\u2019n, there stood in view An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew, Dodder\u2019d with age, whose boughs encompass round The household gods, and shade the holy ground. Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain. Driv\u2019n like a flock of doves along the sky, Their images they hug, and to their altars fly. The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord, And hanging by his side a heavy sword, \u2018What rage,\u2019 she cried, \u2018has seiz\u2019d my husband\u2019s mind? What arms are these, and to what use design\u2019d? These times want other aids! Were Hector here, Ev\u2019n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear. With us, one common shelter thou shalt find, Or in one common fate with us be join\u2019d.\u2019 She said, and with a last salute embrac\u2019d The poor old man, and by the laurel plac\u2019d. Behold! Polites, one of Priam\u2019s sons, Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs. Thro\u2019 swords and foes, amaz\u2019d and hurt, he flies Thro\u2019 empty courts and open galleries. Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues, And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.", " Soon as the royal youth appear\u2019d in view, He sent his voice before him as he flew: \u201cWhat madness moves you, matrons, to destroy The last remainders of unhappy Troy! Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn, And on your friends your fatal fury turn. Behold your own Ascanius!\u201d While he said, He drew his glitt\u2019ring helmet from his head, In which the youths to sportful arms he led. By this, Aeneas and his train appear; And now the women, seiz\u2019d with shame and fear, Dispers\u2019d, to woods and caverns take their flight, Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; Their friends acknowledge, and their error find, And shake the goddess from their alter\u2019d mind. Not so the raging fires their fury cease, But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, Work on their way amid the smould\u2019ring tow, Sure in destruction, but in motion slow. The silent plague thro\u2019 the green timber eats, And vomits out a tardy flame by fits. Down to the keels, and upward to the sails, The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; Nor buckets pour\u2019d, nor strength of human hand, Can the victorious element withstand. The pious hero rends his robe, and throws To heav\u2019n his hands, and with his hands his vows. \u201cO Jove,\u201d he cried, \u201cif pray\u2019rs can yet have place; If thou abhorr\u2019st not all the Dardan race; If any spark of pity still remain; If gods are gods, and not invok\u2019d in vain; Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!"]}
