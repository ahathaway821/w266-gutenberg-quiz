With heedless hands the Trojans fell\u2019d the tree, To make the ground enclos\u2019d for combat free.

Neptune drives off the winds, and calms the sea. Aeneas, with his own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her son\u2019s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians.

When Venulus began, the murmuring sound Was hush\u2019d, and sacred silence reign\u2019d around. \u201cWe have,\u201d said he, \u201cperform\u2019d your high command, And pass\u2019d with peril a long tract of land: We reach\u2019d the place desir\u2019d; with wonder fill\u2019d, The Grecian tents and rising tow\u2019rs beheld."], "What symbolizesthe beginning of battle for the Latins?": [" This is the way to heav\u2019n: the pow\u2019rs divine From this beginning date the Julian line.

Troy is too narrow for thy name.\u201d He said, And plunging downward shot his radiant head; Dispell\u2019d the breathing air, that broke his flight: Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. Old Butes\u2019 form he took, Anchises\u2019 squire, Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: \u201cSuffice it thee, thy father\u2019s worthy son, The warlike prize thou hast already won. The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. Now tempt the war no more.\u201d He said, and flew Obscure in air, and vanish\u2019d from their view.

Now Turnus leads his troops without delay, Advancing to the margin of the sea. The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail\u2019d The clowns new-rais\u2019d and raw, and soon prevail\u2019d. Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight; Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height. He first in open field defied the prince: But armour scal\u2019d with gold was no defence Against the fated sword, which open\u2019d wide His plated shield, and pierc\u2019d his naked side. Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born, Was from his wretched mother ripp\u2019d and torn; Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee; For his beginning life from biting steel was free. Not far from him was Gyas laid along, Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail\u2019d, Nor valour nor Herculean arms avail\u2019d, Nor their fam\u2019d father, wont in war to go With great Alcides, while he toil\u2019d below.", " Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound; Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.

The flying dart she first attempts to fling, And round her tender temples toss\u2019d the sling; Then, as her strength with years increas\u2019d, began To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan, And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane. The Tuscan matrons with each other vied, To bless their rival sons with such a bride; But she disdains their love, to share with me The sylvan shades and vow\u2019d virginity. And, O! I wish, contented with my cares Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars! Then had she been of my celestial train, And shunn\u2019d the fate that dooms her to be slain.

But fate and envious fortune now prepare To plunge the Latins in the last despair.

Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame, Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore To fam\u2019d Anchises on th\u2019 Idaean shore? It calls into my mind, tho\u2019 then a child, When Teucer came, from Salamis exil\u2019d, And sought my father\u2019s aid, to be restor\u2019d: My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare, And, conqu\u2019ring, finish\u2019d the successful war. From him the Trojan siege I understood, The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood. Your foe himself the Dardan valour prais\u2019d, And his own ancestry from Trojans rais\u2019d. Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find, If not a costly welcome, yet a kind: For I myself, like you, have been distress\u2019d, Till Heav\u2019n afforded me this place of rest; Like you, an alien in a land unknown, I learn to pity woes so like my own.\u201d She said, and to the palace led her guest; Then offer\u2019d incense, and proclaim\u2019d a feast.", " Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, And either hand a pointed jav\u2019lin bore.

Now, when the following morn had chas\u2019d away The flying stars, and light restor\u2019d the day, Aeneas call\u2019d the Trojan troops around, And thus bespoke them from a rising ground: \u201cOffspring of heav\u2019n, divine Dardanian race! The sun, revolving thro\u2019 th\u2019 ethereal space, The shining circle of the year has fill\u2019d, Since first this isle my father\u2019s ashes held: And now the rising day renews the year; A day for ever sad, for ever dear. This would I celebrate with annual games, With gifts on altars pil\u2019d, and holy flames, Tho\u2019 banish\u2019d to Gaetulia\u2019s barren sands, Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands: But since this happy storm our fleet has driv\u2019n (Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav\u2019n) Upon these friendly shores and flow\u2019ry plains, Which hide Anchises and his blest remains, Let us with joy perform his honours due, And pray for prosp\u2019rous winds, our voyage to renew; Pray, that in towns and temples of our own, The name of great Anchises may be known, And yearly games may spread the gods\u2019 renown.", " Of various things discoursing as he pass\u2019d, Anchises hither bends his steps at last. Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn\u2019d to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII THE ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call\u2019d from thee, The nurse of great Aeneas\u2019 infancy.", " The Sibyl foretells Aeneas the adventures he should meet with in Italy. She attends him to hell; describing to him the various scenes of that place, and conducting him to his father Anchises, who instructs him in those sublime mysteries, of the soul of the world, and the transmigration; and shows him that glorious race of heroes, which was to descend from him and his posterity. He said, and wept; then spread his sails before The winds, and reach\u2019d at length the Cumaean shore: Their anchors dropp\u2019d, his crew the vessels moor. They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land, And greet with greedy joy th\u2019 Italian strand. Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed; Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed, Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods, Or trace thro\u2019 valleys the discover\u2019d floods.

Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus\u2019 consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Aeneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed. Jupiter despatches Mercury to Aeneas, to warn him from Carthage. Aeneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister\u2019s entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But anxious cares already seiz\u2019d the queen: She fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero\u2019s valour, acts, and birth inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.

So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head The star by whom the lights of heav\u2019n are led; Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews, Dispels the darkness, and the day renews. The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd, And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud, Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war. The troops, drawn up in beautiful array, O\u2019er heathy plains pursue the ready way. Repeated peals of shouts are heard around; The neighing coursers answer to the sound, And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground. A greenwood shade, for long religion known, Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town, Incompass\u2019d round with gloomy hills above, Which add a holy horror to the grove. The first inhabitants of Grecian blood, That sacred forest to Silvanus vow\u2019d, The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay Their due devotions on his annual day.", " Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. Thro\u2019 the black forest and the ferny brake, Unknowingly secure, their way they take; From the rough mountains to the plain descend, And there, in order drawn, their line extend. Both armies now in open fields are seen; Nor far the distance of the space between. Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death.", " The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force."], "Why do the Trojanships turn into sea nymphs when Turnus tries to burn them?": [" His hand and watchful eye keep even pace; While Dares traverses and shifts his place, And, like a captain who beleaguers round Some strong-built castle on a rising ground, Views all th\u2019 approaches with observing eyes: This and that other part in vain he tries, And more on industry than force relies. With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe; But Dares watch\u2019d the motion from below, And slipp\u2019d aside, and shunn\u2019d the long descending blow. Entellus wastes his forces on the wind, And, thus deluded of the stroke design\u2019d, Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast And weighty limbs his ancient mother press\u2019d. So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood On Ida\u2019s height, or Erymanthus\u2019 wood, Torn from the roots. The diff\u2019ring nations rise, And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies, Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise The fall\u2019n companion of his youthful days. Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return\u2019d; With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn\u2019d.", " But if it climb, with your assisting hands, The Trojan walls, and in the city stands; Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn, And the reverse of fate on us return.\u2019 \u201cWith such deceits he gain\u2019d their easy hearts, Too prone to credit his perfidious arts. What Diomede, nor Thetis\u2019 greater son, A thousand ships, nor ten years\u2019 siege, had done: False tears and fawning words the city won. \u201cA greater omen, and of worse portent, Did our unwary minds with fear torment, Concurring to produce the dire event. Laocoon, Neptune\u2019s priest by lot that year, With solemn pomp then sacrific\u2019d a steer; When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied Two serpents, rank\u2019d abreast, the seas divide, And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. Their flaming crests above the waves they show; Their bellies seem to burn the seas below; Their speckled tails advance to steer their course, And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.", " And here the tam\u2019d Euphrates humbly glides, And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; The Danes\u2019 unconquer\u2019d offspring march behind, And Morini, the last of humankind. These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, By Vulcan labour\u2019d, and by Venus brought, With joy and wonder fill the hero\u2019s thought. Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. BOOK IX THE ARGUMENT. Turnus takes advantage of Aeneas\u2019s absence, fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea nymphs,) and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduced to the last extremities, send Ninus and Euryalus to recall Aeneas; which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and the conclusion of their adventure. While these affairs in distant places pass\u2019d, The various Iris Juno sends with haste, To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.", " His pow\u2019r to hollow caverns is confin\u2019d: There let him reign, the jailer of the wind, With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call, And boast and bluster in his empty hall.\u201d He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth\u2019d the sea, Dispell\u2019d the darkness, and restor\u2019d the day. Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main, Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands: The god himself with ready trident stands, And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands; Then heaves them off the shoals. Where\u2019er he guides His finny coursers and in triumph rides, The waves unruffle and the sea subsides. As, when in tumults rise th\u2019 ignoble crowd, Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud; And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly, And all the rustic arms that fury can supply: If then some grave and pious man appear, They hush their noise, and lend a list\u2019ning ear; He soothes with sober words their angry mood, And quenches their innate desire of blood: So, when the Father of the Flood appears, And o\u2019er the seas his sov\u2019reign trident rears, Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains, High on his chariot, and, with loosen\u2019d reins, Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains."], "Who begs to beexecuted in place of his friend Euryalus?": [" The next, but tho\u2019 the next, yet far disjoin\u2019d, Came Salius, and Euryalus behind; Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied, Step after step, and almost side by side, His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space, Had won, or left at least a dubious race. Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last, When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste, Slipp\u2019d first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, Soak\u2019d with the blood of oxen newly slain. The careless victor had not mark\u2019d his way; But, treading where the treach\u2019rous puddle lay, His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor He fell, besmear\u2019d with filth and holy gore. Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee, Nor of the sacred bonds of amity, He strove th\u2019 immediate rival\u2019s hope to cross, And caught the foot of Salius as he rose. So Salius lay extended on the plain; Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend The victor to the goal, who vanquish\u2019d by his friend.", " His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; His mother was a huntress of the wood, And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, But better skill\u2019d unerring shafts to send. Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend: Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast. Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. One was their care, and their delight was one: One common hazard in the war they shar\u2019d, And now were both by choice upon the guard. Then Nisus thus: \u201cOr do the gods inspire This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? A gen\u2019rous ardour boils within my breast, Eager of action, enemy to rest: This urges me to fight, and fires my mind To leave a memorable name behind. Thou see\u2019st the foe secure; how faintly shine Their scatter\u2019d fires! the most, in sleep supine Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; All hush\u2019d around.", " Yet, for his galley sav\u2019d, the grateful prince Is pleas\u2019d th\u2019 unhappy chief to recompense. Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care, Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair. From thence his way the Trojan hero bent Into the neighb\u2019ring plain, with mountains pent, Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. Full in the midst of this fair valley stood A native theatre, which, rising slow By just degrees, o\u2019erlook\u2019d the ground below. High on a sylvan throne the leader sate; A num\u2019rous train attend in solemn state. Here those that in the rapid course delight, Desire of honour and the prize invite. The rival runners without order stand; The Trojans mix\u2019d with the Sicilian band. First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears; Euryalus a boy of blooming years, With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown\u2019d; Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown\u2019d. Diores next, of Priam\u2019s royal race, Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place; But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, And Salius his from Arcananian earth; Then two Sicilian youths, the names of these, Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes: Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, And owning old Acestes for their head; With sev\u2019ral others of ignobler name, Whom time has not deliver\u2019d o\u2019er to fame.", " Now hear what I revolve\u2014 A thought unripe\u2014and scarcely yet resolve. Our absent prince both camp and council mourn; By message both would hasten his return: If they confer what I demand on thee, (For fame is recompense enough for me,) Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied A way that safely will my passage guide.\u201d Euryalus stood list\u2019ning while he spoke, With love of praise and noble envy struck; Then to his ardent friend expos\u2019d his mind: \u201cAll this, alone, and leaving me behind! Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join\u2019d? Think\u2019st thou I can my share of glory yield, Or send thee unassisted to the field? Not so my father taught my childhood arms; Born in a siege, and bred among alarms! Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend, Nor of the heav\u2019n-born hero I attend. The thing call\u2019d life, with ease I can disclaim, And think it over-sold to purchase fame.\u201d Then Nisus thus: \u201cAlas! thy tender years Would minister new matter to my fears."], "Who kills Pallas?": [" To the rude shock of war both armies came; Their leaders equal, and their strength the same. The rear so press\u2019d the front, they could not wield Their angry weapons, to dispute the field. Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: Of equal youth and beauty both appear, But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air. Their congress in the field great Jove withstands: Both doom\u2019d to fall, but fall by greater hands. Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief Of Lausus\u2019 danger, urging swift relief. With his driv\u2019n chariot he divides the crowd, And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud: \u201cLet none presume his needless aid to join; Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: To this right hand is Pallas only due; O were his father here, my just revenge to view!\u201d From the forbidden space his men retir\u2019d. Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir\u2019d; Survey\u2019d him o\u2019er and o\u2019er with wond\u2019ring sight, Struck with his haughty mien, and tow\u2019ring height.", " Occasion offers, and I stand prepar\u2019d; There lies our way; be thou upon the guard, And look around, while I securely go, And hew a passage thro\u2019 the sleeping foe.\u201d Softly he spoke; then striding took his way, With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay; His head rais\u2019d high on tapestry beneath, And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath; A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov\u2019d: But fate by prescience cannot be remov\u2019d. Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies. His armour-bearer first, and next he kills His charioteer, intrench\u2019d betwixt the wheels And his lov\u2019d horses; last invades their lord; Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword: The gasping head flies off; a purple flood Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood, Which, by the spurning heels dispers\u2019d around, The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground. Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong, He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.", " Nor will I add new honours to thy grave, Content with those the Trojan hero gave: That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design\u2019d, In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join\u2019d. Great spoils and trophies, gain\u2019d by thee, they bear: Then let thy own achievements be thy share. Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, Whose mighty trunk had better grac\u2019d the wood, If Pallas had arriv\u2019d, with equal length Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain These troops, to view the tears thou shedd\u2019st in vain? Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, And, after Pallas\u2019 death, live ling\u2019ring on, \u2019Tis to behold his vengeance for my son. I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead. My son and I expect it from his hand; \u2019Tis all that he can give, or we demand. Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, To greet my Pallas with such news below.\u201d The morn had now dispell\u2019d the shades of night, Restoring toils, when she restor\u2019d the light.", " From hence the Grecian bards their legends make, And give the name Avernus to the lake. Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught, For sacrifice the pious hero brought. The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns; Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns, Invoking Hecate hither to repair: A pow\u2019rful name in hell and upper air. The sacred priests with ready knives bereave The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night (The sable wool without a streak of white) Aeneas offers; and, by fate\u2019s decree, A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee, With holocausts he Pluto\u2019s altar fills; Sev\u2019n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills; Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours; Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours. Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun, Nor ended till the next returning sun. Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance, And howling dogs in glimm\u2019ring light advance, Ere Hecate came."], "How does Junoget Turnus away from battle and onto a ship?": [" The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain, Shall wish untouch\u2019d the trophies of the slain; Shall wish the fatal belt were far away, And curse the dire remembrance of the day. The sad Arcadians, from th\u2019 unhappy field, Bear back the breathless body on a shield. O grace and grief of war! at once restor\u2019d, With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor\u2019d! One day first sent thee to the fighting field, Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill\u2019d; One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield. This dismal news, not from uncertain fame, But sad spectators, to the hero came: His friends upon the brink of ruin stand, Unless reliev\u2019d by his victorious hand. He whirls his sword around, without delay, And hews thro\u2019 adverse foes an ample way, To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud: Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow\u2019d To large deserts, are present to his eyes; His plighted hand, and hospitable ties.", " Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste, Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass\u2019d. Scarce had he reach\u2019d the prow: Saturnia\u2019s hand The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land. With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea, And measures back with speed her former way. Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe, And sends his slaughter\u2019d troops to shades below. The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, And flew sublime, and vanish\u2019d in a cloud. Too late young Turnus the delusion found, Far on the sea, still making from the ground. Then, thankless for a life redeem\u2019d by shame, With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame, Fearful besides of what in fight had pass\u2019d, His hands and haggard eyes to heav\u2019n he cast; \u201cO Jove!\u201d he cried, \u201cfor what offence have I Deserv\u2019d to bear this endless infamy? Whence am I forc\u2019d, and whether am I borne? How, and with what reproach, shall I return? Shall ever I behold the Latian plain, Or see Laurentum\u2019s lofty tow\u2019rs again?", " With manly mien he stalk\u2019d along the ground, Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound. (Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight, Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.) The spectre seems the Daunian chief to dare, And flourishes his empty sword in air. At this, advancing, Turnus hurl\u2019d his spear: The phantom wheel\u2019d, and seem\u2019d to fly for fear. Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled, And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed. \u201cWhether, O coward?\u201d (thus he calls aloud, Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas\u2019d a cloud,) \u201cWhy thus forsake your bride! Receive from me The fated land you sought so long by sea.\u201d He said, and, brandishing at once his blade, With eager pace pursued the flying shade. By chance a ship was fasten\u2019d to the shore, Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore: The plank was ready laid for safe ascent; For shelter there the trembling shadow bent, And skipp\u2019t and skulk\u2019d, and under hatches went.", " Th\u2019 Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host, Advance in order on the Latian coast: To cut their way the Daunian chief designs, Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines. Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light, First arm thy soldiers for th\u2019 ensuing fight: Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield, And bear aloft th\u2019 impenetrable shield. Tomorrow\u2019s sun, unless my skill be vain, Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain.\u201d Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force Push\u2019d on the vessel in her wat\u2019ry course; For well she knew the way. Impell\u2019d behind, The ship flew forward, and outstripp\u2019d the wind. The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause, The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws. Then thus he pray\u2019d, and fix\u2019d on heav\u2019n his eyes: \u201cHear thou, great Mother of the deities. With turrets crown\u2019d! (on Ida\u2019s holy hill Fierce tigers, rein\u2019d and curb\u2019d, obey thy will.)

Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand A truce, with olive branches in their hand; Obtest his clemency, and from the plain Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain. They plead, that none those common rites deny To conquer\u2019d foes that in fair battle die. All cause of hate was ended in their death; Nor could he war with bodies void of breath. A king, they hop\u2019d, would hear a king\u2019s request, Whose son he once was call\u2019d, and once his guest. Their suit, which was too just to be denied, The hero grants, and farther thus replied: \u201cO Latian princes, how severe a fate In causeless quarrels has involv\u2019d your state, And arm\u2019d against an unoffending man, Who sought your friendship ere the war began! You beg a truce, which I would gladly give, Not only for the slain, but those who live.", " Now learn from me thy near approaching grief, Nor think my wishes want to thy relief. While fortune favour\u2019d, nor Heav\u2019n\u2019s King denied To lend my succour to the Latian side, I sav\u2019d thy brother, and the sinking state: But now he struggles with unequal fate, And goes, with gods averse, o\u2019ermatch\u2019d in might, To meet inevitable death in fight; Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight. Thou, if thou dar\u2019st thy present aid supply; It well becomes a sister\u2019s care to try.\u201d At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress\u2019d, Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast. To whom Saturnia thus: \u201cThy tears are late: Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch\u2019d from fate: New tumults kindle; violate the truce: Who knows what changeful fortune may produce? \u2019Tis not a crime t\u2019 attempt what I decree; Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me.\u201d She said, and, sailing on the winged wind, Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.", " Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew, Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew, And sanguine streams the slipp\u2019ry ground embrue. First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace, He cries aloud, to make the combat cease: \u201cRutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire! The fight is mine; and me the gods require. \u2019Tis just that I should vindicate alone The broken truce, or for the breach atone.

Next Aventinus drives his chariot round The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown\u2019d. Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field; His father\u2019s hydra fills his ample shield: A hundred serpents hiss about the brims; The son of Hercules he justly seems By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs; Of heav\u2019nly part, and part of earthly blood, A mortal woman mixing with a god. For strong Alcides, after he had slain The triple Geryon, drove from conquer\u2019d Spain His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led, On Tuscan Tiber\u2019s flow\u2019ry banks they fed.

Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose, Before the love-sick lady heard the news; And move her tender mind, by slow degrees, To suffer what the sov\u2019reign pow\u2019r decrees: Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say. They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey. But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise: (What arts can blind a jealous woman\u2019s eyes!) She was the first to find the secret fraud, Before the fatal news was blaz\u2019d abroad. Love the first motions of the lover hears, Quick to presage, and ev\u2019n in safety fears.

Silent they move, majestically slow, Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow. The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far, And the dark menace of the distant war. Caicus from the rampire saw it rise, Black\u2019ning the fields, and thick\u2019ning thro\u2019 the skies.

Sidonian Dido here with solemn state Did Juno\u2019s temple build, and consecrate, Enrich\u2019d with gifts, and with a golden shrine; But more the goddess made the place divine.

Aeneas then advanc\u2019d amidst the train, By thousands follow\u2019d thro\u2019 the flow\u2019ry plain, To great Anchises\u2019 tomb; which when he found, He pour\u2019d to Bacchus, on the hallow\u2019d ground, Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, And two from offer\u2019d bulls of purple gore, With roses then the sepulcher he strow\u2019d And thus his father\u2019s ghost bespoke aloud: \u201cHail, O ye holy manes!", " What god can tell, what numbers can display, The various labours of that fatal day; What chiefs and champions fell on either side, In combat slain, or by what deaths they died; Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill\u2019d; Who shar\u2019d the fame and fortune of the field! Jove, could\u2019st thou view, and not avert thy sight, Two jarring nations join\u2019d in cruel fight, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found, Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground; Betwixt his ribs the jav\u2019lin drove so just, It reach\u2019d his heart, nor needs a second thrust. Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail\u2019d Diores, and in equal fight prevail\u2019d. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, Whom without respite at one charge he slew: Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress\u2019d, And sad Onythes, added to the rest, Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore.", " Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs, And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins.

Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay, Betwixt the confines of the night and day, Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried The foulness of th\u2019 infernal form to hide. Propp\u2019d on a staff, she takes a trembling mien: Her face is furrow\u2019d, and her front obscene; Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws; Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws; Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound, Her temples with an olive wreath are crown\u2019d. Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane Of Juno, now she seem\u2019d, and thus began, Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man: \u201cShall Turnus then such endless toil sustain In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?", " Following the blow, he seiz\u2019d his curling crown With his left hand; his other cast him down. The prostrate body with his knees he press\u2019d, And plung\u2019d his holy poniard in his breast. While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued The shepherd Alsus thro\u2019 the flying crowd, Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow Full on the front of his unwary foe. The broad ax enters with a crashing sound, And cleaves the chin with one continued wound; Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress\u2019d, And seal\u2019d their heavy lids in endless rest. But good Aeneas rush\u2019d amid the bands; Bare was his head, and naked were his hands, In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud: \u201cWhat sudden rage, what new desire of blood, Inflames your alter\u2019d minds? O Trojans, cease From impious arms, nor violate the peace! By human sanctions, and by laws divine, The terms are all agreed; the war is mine.", " Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see The lurking gold upon the fatal tree: Then rend it off, as holy rites command; The willing metal will obey thy hand, Following with ease, if favour\u2019d by thy fate, Thou art foredoom\u2019d to view the Stygian state: If not, no labour can the tree constrain; And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain. Besides, you know not, while you here attend, Th\u2019 unworthy fate of your unhappy friend: Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, Depriv\u2019d of fun\u2019ral rites, pollutes your host. Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead, Two sable sheep around his hearse be led; Then, living turfs upon his body lay: This done, securely take the destin\u2019d way, To find the regions destitute of day.\u201d She said, and held her peace.

Then I, without support, In private mourn\u2019d his loss, and left the court. Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate With silent grief, but loudly blam\u2019d the state, And curs\u2019d the direful author of my woes. \u2019Twas told again; and hence my ruin rose. I threaten\u2019d, if indulgent Heav\u2019n once more Would land me safely on my native shore, His death with double vengeance to restore. This mov\u2019d the murderer\u2019s hate; and soon ensued Th\u2019 effects of malice from a man so proud. Ambiguous rumours thro\u2019 the camp he spread, And sought, by treason, my devoted head; New crimes invented; left unturn\u2019d no stone, To make my guilt appear, and hide his own; Till Calchas was by force and threat\u2019ning wrought: But why\u2014why dwell I on that anxious thought?", " Meantime the rising tow\u2019rs are at a stand; No labours exercise the youthful band, Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know; The mole is left unfinish\u2019d to the foe; The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie, Short of their promis\u2019d heighth, that seem\u2019d to threat the sky, But when imperial Juno, from above, Saw Dido fetter\u2019d in the chains of love, Hot with the venom which her veins inflam\u2019d, And by no sense of shame to be reclaim\u2019d, With soothing words to Venus she begun: \u201cHigh praises, endless honours, you have won, And mighty trophies, with your worthy son!

I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath, My name invoking to revenge his death. Brave Ufens fell with honour on the place, To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace. On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies; His vest and armour are the victor\u2019s prize. Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame, Which only wanted, to complete my shame? How will the Latins hoot their champion\u2019s flight! How Drances will insult and point them to the sight! Is death so hard to bear?

Thus, wand\u2019ring in my way, without a guide, The graceless Helen in the porch I spied Of Vesta\u2019s temple; there she lurk\u2019d alone; Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: But, by the flames that cast their blaze around, That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.", " Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see The lurking gold upon the fatal tree: Then rend it off, as holy rites command; The willing metal will obey thy hand, Following with ease, if favour\u2019d by thy fate, Thou art foredoom\u2019d to view the Stygian state: If not, no labour can the tree constrain; And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain. Besides, you know not, while you here attend, Th\u2019 unworthy fate of your unhappy friend: Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, Depriv\u2019d of fun\u2019ral rites, pollutes your host. Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead, Two sable sheep around his hearse be led; Then, living turfs upon his body lay: This done, securely take the destin\u2019d way, To find the regions destitute of day.\u201d She said, and held her peace.

You are his fav\u2019rite; you alone can find The dark recesses of his inmost mind: In all his trusted secrets you have part, And know the soft approaches to his heart. Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe; Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go, Nor did my fleet against his friends employ, Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy, Nor mov\u2019d with hands profane his father\u2019s dust: Why should he then reject a suit so just!", " Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound; Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.

Turnus takes advantage of Aeneas\u2019s absence, fires some of his ships (which are transformed into sea nymphs,) and assaults his camp. The Trojans, reduced to the last extremities, send Ninus and Euryalus to recall Aeneas; which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship, generosity, and the conclusion of their adventure.

Thro\u2019 the black forest and the ferny brake, Unknowingly secure, their way they take; From the rough mountains to the plain descend, And there, in order drawn, their line extend. Both armies now in open fields are seen; Nor far the distance of the space between. Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh.

There Capys, author of the Capuan name, And there was Mnestheus too, increas\u2019d in fame, Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame. Thus mortal war was wag\u2019d on either side.

But you, my charge, Loos\u2019d from your crooked anchors, launch at large, Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand, And swim the seas, at Cybele\u2019s command.\u201d No sooner had the goddess ceas\u2019d to speak, When, lo! th\u2019 obedient ships their haulsers break; And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again: As many beauteous maids the billows sweep, As rode before tall vessels on the deep. The foes, surpris\u2019d with wonder, stood aghast; Messapus curb\u2019d his fiery courser\u2019s haste; Old Tiber roar\u2019d, and, raising up his head, Call\u2019d back his waters to their oozy bed. Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, And with these words his trembling troops bespoke: \u201cThese monsters for the Trojans\u2019 fate are meant, And are by Jove for black presages sent.", " Let her the causes of her hatred tell; But you can witness its effects too well.

With fury she possess\u2019d the Dardan dames, To burn their fleet with execrable flames, And forc\u2019d Aeneas, when his ships were lost, To leave his foll\u2019wers on a foreign coast. For what remains, your godhead I implore, And trust my son to your protecting pow\u2019r.

What Diomede, nor Thetis\u2019 greater son, A thousand ships, nor ten years\u2019 siege, had done: False tears and fawning words the city won. \u201cA greater omen, and of worse portent, Did our unwary minds with fear torment, Concurring to produce the dire event. Laocoon, Neptune\u2019s priest by lot that year, With solemn pomp then sacrific\u2019d a steer; When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied Two serpents, rank\u2019d abreast, the seas divide, And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. Their flaming crests above the waves they show; Their bellies seem to burn the seas below; Their speckled tails advance to steer their course, And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.", " BOOK V THE ARGUMENT.

Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last, When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste, Slipp\u2019d first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, Soak\u2019d with the blood of oxen newly slain. The careless victor had not mark\u2019d his way; But, treading where the treach\u2019rous puddle lay, His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor He fell, besmear\u2019d with filth and holy gore. Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee, Nor of the sacred bonds of amity, He strove th\u2019 immediate rival\u2019s hope to cross, And caught the foot of Salius as he rose. So Salius lay extended on the plain; Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend The victor to the goal, who vanquish\u2019d by his friend.", " Yet, for his galley sav\u2019d, the grateful prince Is pleas\u2019d th\u2019 unhappy chief to recompense.

From thence his way the Trojan hero bent Into the neighb\u2019ring plain, with mountains pent, Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. Full in the midst of this fair valley stood A native theatre, which, rising slow By just degrees, o\u2019erlook\u2019d the ground below. High on a sylvan throne the leader sate; A num\u2019rous train attend in solemn state. Here those that in the rapid course delight, Desire of honour and the prize invite. The rival runners without order stand; The Trojans mix\u2019d with the Sicilian band. First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears; Euryalus a boy of blooming years, With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown\u2019d; Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown\u2019d. Diores next, of Priam\u2019s royal race, Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place; But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, And Salius his from Arcananian earth; Then two Sicilian youths, the names of these, Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes: Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, And owning old Acestes for their head; With sev\u2019ral others of ignobler name, Whom time has not deliver\u2019d o\u2019er to fame.", " His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; His mother was a huntress of the wood, And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, But better skill\u2019d unerring shafts to send. Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend: Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast. Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. One was their care, and their delight was one: One common hazard in the war they shar\u2019d, And now were both by choice upon the guard. Then Nisus thus: \u201cOr do the gods inspire This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? A gen\u2019rous ardour boils within my breast, Eager of action, enemy to rest: This urges me to fight, and fires my mind To leave a memorable name behind. Thou see\u2019st the foe secure; how faintly shine Their scatter\u2019d fires! the most, in sleep supine Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; All hush\u2019d around."], "Who revives the Trojans' fortunes during the attack on their fortress?": [" Thus two tall oaks, that Padus\u2019 banks adorn, Lift up to heav\u2019n their leafy heads unshorn, And, overpress\u2019d with nature\u2019s heavy load, Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod. In flows a tide of Latians, when they see The gate set open, and the passage free; Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on, Equicolus, that in bright armour shone, And Haemon first; but soon repuls\u2019d they fly, Or in the well-defended pass they die. These with success are fir\u2019d, and those with rage, And each on equal terms at length engage. Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain, The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain. Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought, When suddenly th\u2019 unhop\u2019d-for news was brought, The foes had left the fastness of their place, Prevail\u2019d in fight, and had his men in chase. He quits th\u2019 attack, and, to prevent their fate, Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate.", " Such things as these Cassandra did relate. This day revives within my mind what she Foretold of Troy renew\u2019d in Italy, And Latian lands; but who could then have thought That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought, Or who believ\u2019d what mad Cassandra taught? Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.\u2019 \u201cHe said; and we with glad consent obey, Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, We spread our sails before the willing wind. Now from the sight of land our galleys move, With only seas around and skies above; When o\u2019er our heads descends a burst of rain, And night with sable clouds involves the main; The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; The scatter\u2019d fleet is forc\u2019d to sev\u2019ral ways; The face of heav\u2019n is ravish\u2019d from our eyes, And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. Cast from our course, we wander in the dark. No stars to guide, no point of land to mark. Ev\u2019n Palinurus no distinction found Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign\u2019d around.", " Retir\u2019d alone she found the daring man, And op\u2019d her rosy lips, and thus began: \u201cWhat none of all the gods could grant thy vows, That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. Aeneas, gone to seek th\u2019 Arcadian prince, Has left the Trojan camp without defence; And, short of succours there, employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs; Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.\u201d This said, on equal wings she pois\u2019d her weight, And form\u2019d a radiant rainbow in her flight. The Daunian hero lifts his hands and eyes, And thus invokes the goddess as she flies: \u201cIris, the grace of heav\u2019n, what pow\u2019r divine Has sent thee down, thro\u2019 dusky clouds to shine? See, they divide; immortal day appears, And glitt\u2019ring planets dancing in their spheres! With joy, these happy omens I obey, And follow to the war the god that leads the way.\u201d Thus having said, as by the brook he stood, He scoop\u2019d the water from the crystal flood; Then with his hands the drops to heav\u2019n he throws, And loads the pow\u2019rs above with offer\u2019d vows.", " The Tyrian queen stood fix\u2019d upon his face, Pleas\u2019d with his motions, ravish\u2019d with his grace; Admir\u2019d his fortunes, more admir\u2019d the man; Then recollected stood, and thus began: \u201cWhat fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow\u2019rs Have cast you shipwreck\u2019d on our barren shores? Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame, Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore To fam\u2019d Anchises on th\u2019 Idaean shore? It calls into my mind, tho\u2019 then a child, When Teucer came, from Salamis exil\u2019d, And sought my father\u2019s aid, to be restor\u2019d: My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare, And, conqu\u2019ring, finish\u2019d the successful war. From him the Trojan siege I understood, The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood. Your foe himself the Dardan valour prais\u2019d, And his own ancestry from Trojans rais\u2019d. Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find, If not a costly welcome, yet a kind: For I myself, like you, have been distress\u2019d, Till Heav\u2019n afforded me this place of rest; Like you, an alien in a land unknown, I learn to pity woes so like my own.\u201d She said, and to the palace led her guest; Then offer\u2019d incense, and proclaim\u2019d a feast."], "Why does Turnus flee the Trojans' fortress?": [" Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. Thro\u2019 the black forest and the ferny brake, Unknowingly secure, their way they take; From the rough mountains to the plain descend, And there, in order drawn, their line extend. Both armies now in open fields are seen; Nor far the distance of the space between. Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death.", " Turnus, the chief, toss\u2019d from his thund\u2019ring hand Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand: It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; The planks were season\u2019d, and the timber dry. Contagion caught the posts; it spread along, Scorch\u2019d, and to distance drove the scatter\u2019d throng. The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain, Still gath\u2019ring fast upon the trembling train; Till, crowding to the corners of the wall, Down the defence and the defenders fall. The mighty flaw makes heav\u2019n itself resound: The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground. The tow\u2019r, that follow\u2019d on the fallen crew, Whelm\u2019d o\u2019er their heads, and buried whom it slew: Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent; All the same equal ruin underwent. Young Lycus and Helenor only scape; Sav\u2019d\u2014how, they know not\u2014from the steepy leap. Helenor, elder of the two: by birth, On one side royal, one a son of earth, Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare, And sent her boasted bastard to the war (A privilege which none but freemen share).", " Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays The champions\u2019 fate, and each exactly weighs. On this side, life and lucky chance ascends; Loaded with death, that other scale descends. Rais\u2019d on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow Full on the helm of his unguarded foe: Shrill shouts and clamours ring on either side, As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide. But all in pieces flies the traitor sword, And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord. Now is but death, or flight; disarm\u2019d he flies, When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies. Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join\u2019d, Hurrying to war, disorder\u2019d in his mind, Snatch\u2019d the first weapon which his haste could find. \u2019Twas not the fated sword his father bore, But that his charioteer Metiscus wore. This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held; But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield, The mortal-temper\u2019d steel deceiv\u2019d his hand: The shiver\u2019d fragments shone amid the sand.", " I came not hither but by Heav\u2019n\u2019s command, And sent by fate to share the Latian land. Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied My proffer\u2019d friendship, and my promis\u2019d bride; Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try His cause in arms, to conquer or to die. My right and his are in dispute: the slain Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. In equal arms let us alone contend; And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. This is the way (so tell him) to possess The royal virgin, and restore the peace. Bear this message back, with ample leave, That your slain friends may fun\u2019ral rites receive.\u201d Thus having said\u2014th\u2019 embassadors, amaz\u2019d, Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz\u2019d. Drances, their chief, who harbour\u2019d in his breast Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess\u2019d, Broke silence first, and to the godlike man, With graceful action bowing, thus began: \u201cAuspicious prince, in arms a mighty name, But yet whose actions far transcend your fame; Would I your justice or your force express, Thought can but equal; and all words are less."], "Why does Aeneas hold several days of celebrations in Eryx?": [" This part is nam\u2019d from Ilium, that from Troy, And the new king ascends the throne with joy; A chosen senate from the people draws; Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws. Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin A rising temple to the Paphian queen. Anchises, last, is honour\u2019d as a god; A priest is added, annual gifts bestow\u2019d, And groves are planted round his blest abode. Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown\u2019d; And fumes of incense in the fanes abound. Then from the south arose a gentle breeze That curl\u2019d the smoothness of the glassy seas; The rising winds a ruffling gale afford, And call the merry mariners aboard. Now loud laments along the shores resound, Of parting friends in close embraces bound. The trembling women, the degenerate train, Who shunn\u2019d the frightful dangers of the main, Ev\u2019n those desire to sail, and take their share Of the rough passage and the promis\u2019d war: Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends To their new master\u2019s care his fearful friends.", " Acestes, fir\u2019d with just disdain, to see The palm usurp\u2019d without a victory, Reproach\u2019d Entellus thus, who sate beside, And heard and saw, unmov\u2019d, the Trojan\u2019s pride: \u201cOnce, but in vain, a champion of renown, So tamely can you bear the ravish\u2019d crown, A prize in triumph borne before your sight, And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight? Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name, The god who taught your thund\u2019ring arm the game? Where now your baffled honour? Where the spoil That fill\u2019d your house, and fame that fill\u2019d our isle?\u201d Entellus, thus: \u201cMy soul is still the same, Unmov\u2019d with fear, and mov\u2019d with martial fame; But my chill blood is curdled in my veins, And scarce the shadow of a man remains. O could I turn to that fair prime again, That prime of which this boaster is so vain, The brave, who this decrepid age defies, Should feel my force, without the promis\u2019d prize.\u201d He said; and, rising at the word, he threw Two pond\u2019rous gauntlets down in open view; Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield, And sheathe his hands with in the listed field.", " Faintly he stagger\u2019d thro\u2019 the hissing throng, And hung his head, and trail\u2019d his legs along. The sword and casque are carried by his train; But with his foe the palm and ox remain. The champion, then, before Aeneas came, Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame: \u201cO goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host, Mark with attention, and forgive my boast; Learn what I was, by what remains; and know From what impending fate you sav\u2019d my foe.\u201d Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull; And, on his ample forehead aiming full, The deadly stroke, descending, pierc\u2019d the skull. Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound, But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground. Then, thus: \u201cIn Dares\u2019 stead I offer this. Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice; Take the last gift my wither\u2019d arms can yield: Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field.\u201d This done, Aeneas orders, for the close, The strife of archers with contending bows.", " Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew, Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew, And sanguine streams the slipp\u2019ry ground embrue. First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace, He cries aloud, to make the combat cease: \u201cRutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire! The fight is mine; and me the gods require. \u2019Tis just that I should vindicate alone The broken truce, or for the breach atone. This day shall free from wars th\u2019 Ausonian state, Or finish my misfortunes in my fate.\u201d Both armies from their bloody work desist, And, bearing backward, form a spacious list. The Trojan hero, who receiv\u2019d from fame The welcome sound, and heard the champion\u2019s name, Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls, Greedy of war where greater glory calls. He springs to fight, exulting in his force His jointed armour rattles in the course. Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows, Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows, His head divine obscure in clouds he hides, And shakes the sounding forest on his sides."], "Who gets the Trojan women to burn their ships?": [" BOOK V THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage.

Their flaming crests above the waves they show; Their bellies seem to burn the seas below; Their speckled tails advance to steer their course, And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.", " Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn, And on your friends your fatal fury turn. Behold your own Ascanius!\u201d While he said, He drew his glitt\u2019ring helmet from his head, In which the youths to sportful arms he led. By this, Aeneas and his train appear; And now the women, seiz\u2019d with shame and fear, Dispers\u2019d, to woods and caverns take their flight, Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; Their friends acknowledge, and their error find, And shake the goddess from their alter\u2019d mind. Not so the raging fires their fury cease, But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, Work on their way amid the smould\u2019ring tow, Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.

Down to the keels, and upward to the sails, The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; Nor buckets pour\u2019d, nor strength of human hand, Can the victorious element withstand.", " The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide, And aid with eager shouts the favour\u2019d side. Cries, murmurs, clamours, with a mixing sound, From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound. Amidst the loud applauses of the shore, Gyas outstripp\u2019d the rest, and sprung before: Cloanthus, better mann\u2019d, pursued him fast, But his o\u2019er-masted galley check\u2019d his haste. The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine With equal oars, advancing in a line; And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead, And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead; Now board to board the rival vessels row, The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.

From thence he directs his course to Delos and asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his habitation. By a mistake of the oracle\u2019s answer, he settles in Crete. His household gods give him the true sense of the oracle in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy. He is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies.

The rest the fates from Helenus conceal, And Juno\u2019s angry pow\u2019r forbids to tell. First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh, Will far from your deluded wishes fly; Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy: For you must cruise along Sicilian shores, And stem the currents with your struggling oars; Then round th\u2019 Italian coast your navy steer; And, after this, to Circe\u2019s island veer; And, last, before your new foundations rise, Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies.", " And now, resign\u2019d to your superior might, And tir\u2019d with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.

Not far from hence, if I observ\u2019d aright The southing of the stars, and polar light, Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores In safety we may reach with struggling oars.\u201d Aeneas then replied: \u201cToo sure I find We strive in vain against the seas and wind: Now shift your sails; what place can please me more Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, Whose hallow\u2019d earth Anchises\u2019 bones contains, And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?\u201d The course resolv\u2019d, before the western wind They scud amain, and make the port assign\u2019d.

Aeneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage. He applies himself to celebrate the memory of his father with divine honours, and accordingly institues funeral games, and appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the ceremonies are performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan woman to burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them: which burned four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous shower extinguished it. Upon this, Aeneas, by the advice of one of his generals, and a vision of his father, builds a city for the women, old men, and others, who were either unfit for war, or weary of the voyage, and sails for Italy. Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting only his pilot Palinurus, who was unfortunately lost.", " Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat\u2019ry way, Fix\u2019d on his voyage, thro\u2019 the curling sea; Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze. The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind The fate of Dido from the fire divin\u2019d; He knew the stormy souls of womankind, What secret springs their eager passions move, How capable of death for injur\u2019d love. Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw; Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw. Now seas and skies their prospect only bound; An empty space above, a floating field around. But soon the heav\u2019ns with shadows were o\u2019erspread; A swelling cloud hung hov\u2019ring o\u2019er their head: Livid it look\u2019d, the threat\u2019ning of a storm: Then night and horror ocean\u2019s face deform. The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud: \u201cWhat gusts of weather from that gath\u2019ring cloud My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.\u201d The frighted crew perform the task assign\u2019d.", " Such things as these Cassandra did relate. This day revives within my mind what she Foretold of Troy renew\u2019d in Italy, And Latian lands; but who could then have thought That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought, Or who believ\u2019d what mad Cassandra taught? Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.\u2019 \u201cHe said; and we with glad consent obey, Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, We spread our sails before the willing wind. Now from the sight of land our galleys move, With only seas around and skies above; When o\u2019er our heads descends a burst of rain, And night with sable clouds involves the main; The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; The scatter\u2019d fleet is forc\u2019d to sev\u2019ral ways; The face of heav\u2019n is ravish\u2019d from our eyes, And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. Cast from our course, we wander in the dark. No stars to guide, no point of land to mark. Ev\u2019n Palinurus no distinction found Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign\u2019d around.", " Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press\u2019d, Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest, Who, while he steering view\u2019d the stars, and bore His course from Afric to the Latian shore, Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix\u2019d his view, And scarcely thro\u2019 the gloom the sullen shadow knew. Then thus the prince: \u201cWhat envious pow\u2019r, O friend, Brought your lov\u2019d life to this disastrous end? For Phoebus, ever true in all he said, Has in your fate alone my faith betray\u2019d. The god foretold you should not die, before You reach\u2019d, secure from seas, th\u2019 Italian shore. Is this th\u2019 unerring pow\u2019r?\u201d The ghost replied; \u201cNor Phoebus flatter\u2019d, nor his answers lied; Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep: But, while the stars and course of heav\u2019n I keep, My wearied eyes were seiz\u2019d with fatal sleep. I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain\u2019d Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain\u2019d. Now by the winds and raging waves I swear, Your safety, more than mine, was then my care; Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost, Your ship should run against the rocky coast."], "Whose temple does Aeneas go to when they reach Italy?": [" Then, to his fearless chief: \u201cNot Heav\u2019n,\u201d said he, \u201cTho\u2019 Jove himself should promise Italy, Can stem the torrent of this raging sea. Mark how the shifting winds from west arise, And what collected night involves the skies! Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea, Much less against the tempest force their way. \u2019Tis fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. Not far from hence, if I observ\u2019d aright The southing of the stars, and polar light, Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores In safety we may reach with struggling oars.\u201d Aeneas then replied: \u201cToo sure I find We strive in vain against the seas and wind: Now shift your sails; what place can please me more Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, Whose hallow\u2019d earth Anchises\u2019 bones contains, And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?\u201d The course resolv\u2019d, before the western wind They scud amain, and make the port assign\u2019d. Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, Beheld the fleet descending on the land; And, not unmindful of his ancient race, Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, And held the hero in a strict embrace.", " Then, when he saw no threat\u2019ning tempest nigh, But a sure promise of a settled sky, He gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep, Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep. \u201cAnd now the rising morn with rosy light Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight; When we from far, like bluish mists, descry The hills, and then the plains, of Italy. Achates first pronounc\u2019d the joyful sound; Then, \u2018Italy!\u2019 the cheerful crew rebound. My sire Anchises crown\u2019d a cup with wine, And, off\u2019ring, thus implor\u2019d the pow\u2019rs divine: \u2018Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas, And you who raging winds and waves appease, Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp\u2019rous wind, And smooth our passage to the port assign\u2019d!\u2019 The gentle gales their flagging force renew, And now the happy harbour is in view. Minerva\u2019s temple then salutes our sight, Plac\u2019d, as a landmark, on the mountain\u2019s height. We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore; The curling waters round the galleys roar.", " The coast, so long desir\u2019d (nor doubt th\u2019 event), Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach\u2019d, repent. Wars, horrid wars, I view; a field of blood, And Tiber rolling with a purple flood. Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there: A new Achilles shall in arms appear, And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno\u2019s hate, Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate. To what strange nations shalt not thou resort, Driv\u2019n to solicit aid at ev\u2019ry court! The cause the same which Ilium once oppress\u2019d; A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest. But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes, The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose. The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town.\u201d Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke, And the resisting air the thunder broke; The cave rebellow\u2019d, and the temple shook. Th\u2019 ambiguous god, who rul\u2019d her lab\u2019ring breast, In these mysterious words his mind express\u2019d; Some truths reveal\u2019d, in terms involv\u2019d the rest.", " At length Leucate\u2019s cloudy top appears, And the Sun\u2019s temple, which the sailor fears. Resolv\u2019d to breathe a while from labour past, Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast, And joyful to the little city haste. Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay To Jove, the guide and patron of our way. The customs of our country we pursue, And Trojan games on Actian shores renew. Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil, And exercise the wrastlers\u2019 noble toil; Pleas\u2019d to have sail\u2019d so long before the wind, And left so many Grecian towns behind. The sun had now fulfill\u2019d his annual course, And Boreas on the seas display\u2019d his force: I fix\u2019d upon the temple\u2019s lofty door The brazen shield which vanquish\u2019d Abas bore; The verse beneath my name and action speaks: \u2018These arms Aeneas took from conqu\u2019ring Greeks.\u2019 Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly."], "How does Aeneas find the tree with the golden bough?": [" Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, And throats of brass, inspir\u2019d with iron lungs, I could not half those horrid crimes repeat, Nor half the punishments those crimes have met. But let us haste our voyage to pursue: The walls of Pluto\u2019s palace are in view; The gate, and iron arch above it, stands On anvils labour\u2019d by the Cyclops\u2019 hands. Before our farther way the Fates allow, Here must we fix on high the golden bough.\u201d She said, and thro\u2019 the gloomy shades they pass\u2019d, And chose the middle path. Arriv\u2019d at last, The prince with living water sprinkled o\u2019er His limbs and body; then approach\u2019d the door, Possess\u2019d the porch, and on the front above He fix\u2019d the fatal bough requir\u2019d by Pluto\u2019s love. These holy rites perform\u2019d, they took their way Where long extended plains of pleasure lay: The verdant fields with those of heav\u2019n may vie, With ether vested, and a purple sky; The blissful seats of happy souls below.", " Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see The lurking gold upon the fatal tree: Then rend it off, as holy rites command; The willing metal will obey thy hand, Following with ease, if favour\u2019d by thy fate, Thou art foredoom\u2019d to view the Stygian state: If not, no labour can the tree constrain; And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain. Besides, you know not, while you here attend, Th\u2019 unworthy fate of your unhappy friend: Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, Depriv\u2019d of fun\u2019ral rites, pollutes your host. Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead, Two sable sheep around his hearse be led; Then, living turfs upon his body lay: This done, securely take the destin\u2019d way, To find the regions destitute of day.\u201d She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went Sad from the cave, and full of discontent, Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. Achates, the companion of his breast, Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress\u2019d.", " He knew his mother\u2019s birds; and thus he pray\u2019d: \u201cBe you my guides, with your auspicious aid, And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, Whose glitt\u2019ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.

They fed, and, flutt\u2019ring, by degrees withdrew Still farther from the place, but still in view: Hopping and flying, thus they led him on To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun They wing\u2019d their flight aloft; then, stooping low, Perch\u2019d on the double tree that bears the golden bough. Thro\u2019 the green leafs the glitt\u2019ring shadows glow; As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe, Where the proud mother views her precious brood, And happier branches, which she never sow\u2019d.", " The queen at length appears; on either hand The brawny guards in martial order stand.

Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase. But far above the rest in beauty shines The great Aeneas, the troop he joins; Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost Of wint\u2019ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast, When to his native Delos he resorts, Ordains the dances, and renews the sports; Where painted Scythians, mix\u2019d with Cretan bands, Before the joyful altars join their hands: Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below The merry madness of the sacred show. Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; A golden fillet binds his awful brows; His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen In manly presence, or in lofty mien."], "Whose souls does Charon refuse to ferry across the river?": [" Not far from hence, along the river\u2019s side, In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide, By Tarchon led.

Thither his warlike train the Trojan led, Refresh\u2019d his men, and wearied horses fed. Meantime the mother goddess, crown\u2019d with charms, Breaks thro\u2019 the clouds, and brings the fated arms. Within a winding vale she finds her son, On the cool river\u2019s banks, retir\u2019d alone. She shews her heav\u2019nly form without disguise, And gives herself to his desiring eyes. \u201cBehold,\u201d she said, \u201cperform\u2019d in ev\u2019ry part, My promise made, and Vulcan\u2019s labour\u2019d art.

A hundred years they wander on the shore; At length, their penance done, are wafted o\u2019er.\u201d The Trojan chief his forward pace repress\u2019d, Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast, He saw his friends, who, whelm\u2019d beneath the waves, Their fun\u2019ral honours claim\u2019d, and ask\u2019d their quiet graves.

Aeneas hastens, tho\u2019 with heavier pace\u2014 His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase, And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse\u2014 Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues. Thus, when a fearful stag is clos\u2019d around With crimson toils, or in a river found, High on the bank the deep-mouth\u2019d hound appears, Still opening, following still, where\u2019er he steers; The persecuted creature, to and fro, Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe: Steep is th\u2019 ascent, and, if he gains the land, The purple death is pitch\u2019d along the strand. His eager foe, determin\u2019d to the chase, Stretch\u2019d at his length, gains ground at ev\u2019ry pace; Now to his beamy head he makes his way, And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey: Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear; He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air: The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries; The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.", " Full in the midst of this infernal road, An elm displays her dusky arms abroad: The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head, And empty dreams on ev\u2019ry leaf are spread. Of various forms unnumber\u2019d spectres more, Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door. Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands, And Briareus with all his hundred hands; Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame; And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame. The chief unsheath\u2019d his shining steel, prepar\u2019d, Tho\u2019 seiz\u2019d with sudden fear, to force the guard, Off\u2019ring his brandish\u2019d weapon at their face; Had not the Sibyl stopp\u2019d his eager pace, And told him what those empty phantoms were: Forms without bodies, and impassive air. Hence to deep Acheron they take their way, Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay, Are whirl\u2019d aloft, and in Cocytus lost. There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast: A sordid god: down from his hoary chin A length of beard descends, uncomb\u2019d, unclean; His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire; A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire."], "Who does Aeneas see in the Fields of Mourning?": [" Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. Thro\u2019 the black forest and the ferny brake, Unknowingly secure, their way they take; From the rough mountains to the plain descend, And there, in order drawn, their line extend. Both armies now in open fields are seen; Nor far the distance of the space between. Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join\u2019d; But westward to the sea the sun declin\u2019d. Intrench\u2019d before the town both armies lie, While night with sable wings involves the sky. BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death.", " That conquer\u2019d earth be theirs, for which they fought, And which for us with their own blood they bought; But first the corpse of our unhappy friend To the sad city of Evander send, Who, not inglorious, in his age\u2019s bloom, Was hurried hence by too severe a doom.\u201d Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay. Acoetes watch\u2019d the corpse; whose youth deserv\u2019d The father\u2019s trust; and now the son he serv\u2019d With equal faith, but less auspicious care. Th\u2019 attendants of the slain his sorrow share. A troop of Trojans mix\u2019d with these appear, And mourning matrons with dishevel\u2019d hair. Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky. They rear his drooping forehead from the ground; But, when Aeneas view\u2019d the grisly wound Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore, And the fair flesh distain\u2019d with purple gore; First, melting into tears, the pious man Deplor\u2019d so sad a sight, then thus began: \u201cUnhappy youth!", " Rushing from out the gate, the people stand, Each with a fun\u2019ral flambeau in his hand. Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze: The fields are lighten\u2019d with a fiery blaze, That cast a sullen splendour on their friends, The marching troop which their dead prince attends. Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, And their mix\u2019d mourning rends the vaulted sky. The town is fill\u2019d with tumult and with tears, Till the loud clamours reach Evander\u2019s ears: Forgetful of his state, he runs along, With a disorder\u2019d pace, and cleaves the throng; Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies, With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes. Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks: \u201cO Pallas! thou hast fail\u2019d thy plighted word, To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword! I warn\u2019d thee, but in vain; for well I knew What perils youthful ardour would pursue, That boiling blood would carry thee too far, Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!", " The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force."], "What future event does Anchises show Aeneas?": [" Dismay\u2019d, and fearful of some dire event, Eurypylus t\u2019 enquire their fate was sent.

Ulysses took th\u2019 advantage of their fright; Call\u2019d Calchas, and produc\u2019d in open sight: Then bade him name the wretch, ordain\u2019d by fate The public victim, to redeem the state. Already some presag\u2019d the dire event, And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant. For twice five days the good old seer withstood Th\u2019 intended treason, and was dumb to blood, Till, tir\u2019d, with endless clamours and pursuit Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute; But, as it was agreed, pronounc\u2019d that I Was destin\u2019d by the wrathful gods to die.", " They wind the hill, and thro\u2019 the blissful meadows go.

Be mistress, and your full desires obtain; But quench the choler you foment in vain. From ancient blood th\u2019 Ausonian people sprung, Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue.", " But, O be present to thy people\u2019s aid, And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!\u201d Thus having said, two galleys from his stores, With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars. Now on the shore the fatal swine is found. Wond\u2019rous to tell!\u2014She lay along the ground: Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung; She white herself, and white her thirty young. Aeneas takes the mother and her brood, And all on Juno\u2019s altar are bestow\u2019d. The foll\u2019wing night, and the succeeding day, Propitious Tiber smooth\u2019d his wat\u2019ry way: He roll\u2019d his river back, and pois\u2019d he stood, A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore, Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. Shouts from the land give omen to their course, And the pitch\u2019d vessels glide with easy force. The woods and waters wonder at the gleam Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream. One summer\u2019s night and one whole day they pass Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.", " He calls me hand to hand, And I alone will answer his demand. Drances shall rest secure, and neither share The danger, nor divide the prize of war.\u201d While they debate, nor these nor those will yield, Aeneas draws his forces to the field, And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed Return, and thro\u2019 the frighted city spread Th\u2019 unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried, In battle marching by the river side, And bending to the town. They take th\u2019 alarm: Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. Th\u2019 impetuous youth press forward to the field; They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield: The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; Old feeble men with fainter groans reply; A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky, Like that of swans remurm\u2019ring to the floods, Or birds of diff\u2019ring kinds in hollow woods. Turnus th\u2019 occasion takes, and cries aloud: \u201cTalk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd: Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls, And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls.\u201d He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace, Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place: \u201cThou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band."], "What is the significance of the Trojans' meal of bread and fruit?": [" Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread His table on the turf, with cakes of bread; And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed. They sate; and, (not without the god\u2019s command,) Their homely fare dispatch\u2019d, the hungry band Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour, To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour. Ascanius this observ\u2019d, and smiling said: \u201cSee, we devour the plates on which we fed.\u201d The speech had omen, that the Trojan race Should find repose, and this the time and place. Aeneas took the word, and thus replies, Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes: \u201cAll hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods! Behold the destin\u2019d place of your abodes! For thus Anchises prophesied of old, And this our fatal place of rest foretold: \u2018When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat, By famine forc\u2019d, your trenchers you shall eat, Then ease your weary Trojans will attend, And the long labours of your voyage end.", " Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field, New fir\u2019d the Trojans, and their foes repell\u2019d. This son of Dolon bore his grandsire\u2019s name, But emulated more his father\u2019s fame; His guileful father, sent a nightly spy, The Grecian camp and order to descry: Hard enterprise! and well he might require Achilles\u2019 car and horses, for his hire: But, met upon the scout, th\u2019 Aetolian prince In death bestow\u2019d a juster recompense. Fierce Turnus view\u2019d the Trojan from afar, And launch\u2019d his jav\u2019lin from his lofty car; Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow, And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe, Wrench\u2019d from his feeble hold the shining sword, And plung\u2019d it in the bosom of its lord. \u201cPossess,\u201d said he, \u201cthe fruit of all thy pains, And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains. Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand; Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!\u201d Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew, Whom o\u2019er his neck his flound\u2019ring courser threw.", " \u201cInstructed from above, My lover I shall gain, or lose my love.

She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep, Reclaim\u2019d his rage, and sooth\u2019d him into sleep. She watch\u2019d the golden fruit; her charms unbind The chains of love, or fix them on the mind: She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry, Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky. The yawning earth rebellows to her call, Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall. Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part, How loth I am to try this impious art! Within the secret court, with silent care, Erect a lofty pile, expos\u2019d in air: Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest, Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest.", " And now in pomp the peaceful kings appear: Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear; Twelve golden beams around his temples play, To mark his lineage from the God of Day. Two snowy coursers Turnus\u2019 chariot yoke, And in his hand two massy spears he shook: Then issued from the camp, in arms divine, Aeneas, author of the Roman line; And by his side Ascanius took his place, The second hope of Rome\u2019s immortal race. Adorn\u2019d in white, a rev\u2019rend priest appears, And off\u2019rings to the flaming altars bears; A porket, and a lamb that never suffer\u2019d shears. Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes, And strews the beasts, design\u2019d for sacrifice, With salt and meal: with like officious care He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair. Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds; With the same gen\u2019rous juice the flame he feeds. Aeneas then unsheath\u2019d his shining sword, And thus with pious pray\u2019rs the gods ador\u2019d: \u201cAll-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil, For which I have sustain\u2019d so long a toil, Thou, King of Heav\u2019n, and thou, the Queen of Air, Propitious now, and reconcil\u2019d by pray\u2019r; Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway The labours and events of arms obey; Ye living fountains, and ye running floods, All pow\u2019rs of ocean, all ethereal gods, Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field, Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield, My Trojans shall encrease Evander\u2019s town; Ascanius shall renounce th\u2019 Ausonian crown: All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease; Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace."], "What does Latinus offer Aeneas in addition to land?": [" Of various things discoursing as he pass\u2019d, Anchises hither bends his steps at last. Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay. At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; Their heads are turn\u2019d to sea, their sterns to shore. BOOK VII THE ARGUMENT. King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related. And thou, O matron of immortal fame, Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; Cajeta still the place is call\u2019d from thee, The nurse of great Aeneas\u2019 infancy.", " The Tyrian queen stood fix\u2019d upon his face, Pleas\u2019d with his motions, ravish\u2019d with his grace; Admir\u2019d his fortunes, more admir\u2019d the man; Then recollected stood, and thus began: \u201cWhat fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow\u2019rs Have cast you shipwreck\u2019d on our barren shores? Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame, Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore To fam\u2019d Anchises on th\u2019 Idaean shore? It calls into my mind, tho\u2019 then a child, When Teucer came, from Salamis exil\u2019d, And sought my father\u2019s aid, to be restor\u2019d: My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare, And, conqu\u2019ring, finish\u2019d the successful war. From him the Trojan siege I understood, The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood. Your foe himself the Dardan valour prais\u2019d, And his own ancestry from Trojans rais\u2019d. Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find, If not a costly welcome, yet a kind: For I myself, like you, have been distress\u2019d, Till Heav\u2019n afforded me this place of rest; Like you, an alien in a land unknown, I learn to pity woes so like my own.\u201d She said, and to the palace led her guest; Then offer\u2019d incense, and proclaim\u2019d a feast.", " But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew His birth from Saturn, if records be true. Thus King Latinus, in the third degree, Had Saturn author of his family. But this old peaceful prince, as Heav\u2019n decreed, Was blest with no male issue to succeed: His sons in blooming youth were snatch\u2019d by fate; One only daughter heir\u2019d the royal state. Fir\u2019d with her love, and with ambition led, The neighb\u2019ring princes court her nuptial bed. Among the crowd, but far above the rest, Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address\u2019d. Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien, Was first, and favour\u2019d by the Latian queen; With him she strove to join Lavinia\u2019s hand, But dire portents the purpos\u2019d match withstand. Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood A laurel\u2019s trunk, a venerable wood; Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair Was kept and cut with superstitious care. This plant Latinus, when his town he wall\u2019d, Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call\u2019d; And last, in honour of his new abode, He vow\u2019d the laurel to the laurel\u2019s god.", " Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought, Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought. Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late, A foreign son is pointed out by fate; And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed, The wrath of Heav\u2019n is hov\u2019ring o\u2019er his head. The gods, he saw, espous\u2019d the juster side, When late their titles in the field were tried: Witness the fresh laments, and fun\u2019ral tears undried. Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all The Latian senate to the council hall. The princes come, commanded by their head, And crowd the paths that to the palace lead. Supreme in pow\u2019r, and reverenc\u2019d for his years, He takes the throne, and in the midst appears. Majestically sad, he sits in state, And bids his envoys their success relate. When Venulus began, the murmuring sound Was hush\u2019d, and sacred silence reign\u2019d around. \u201cWe have,\u201d said he, \u201cperform\u2019d your high command, And pass\u2019d with peril a long tract of land: We reach\u2019d the place desir\u2019d; with wonder fill\u2019d, The Grecian tents and rising tow\u2019rs beheld."], "Who angers the natives against the Trojans?": [" The Trojans to their customs shall be tied: I will, myself, their common rites provide; The natives shall command, the foreigners subside. All shall be Latium; Troy without a name; And her lost sons forget from whence they came. From blood so mix\u2019d, a pious race shall flow, Equal to gods, excelling all below. No nation more respect to you shall pay, Or greater off\u2019rings on your altars lay.\u201d Juno consents, well pleas\u2019d that her desires Had found success, and from the cloud retires. The peace thus made, the Thund\u2019rer next prepares To force the wat\u2019ry goddess from the wars. Deep in the dismal regions void of light, Three daughters at a birth were born to Night: These their brown mother, brooding on her care, Indued with windy wings to flit in air, With serpents girt alike, and crown\u2019d with hissing hair. In heav\u2019n the Dirae call\u2019d, and still at hand, Before the throne of angry Jove they stand, His ministers of wrath, and ready still The minds of mortal men with fears to fill, Whene\u2019er the moody sire, to wreak his hate On realms or towns deserving of their fate, Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care, And terrifies the guilty world with war.", " Soon thro\u2019 the joyful camp a rumour flew, The time was come their city to renew. Then ev\u2019ry brow with cheerful green is crown\u2019d, The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round. When next the rosy morn disclos\u2019d the day, The scouts to sev\u2019ral parts divide their way, To learn the natives\u2019 names, their towns explore, The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore: Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands; Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands. The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways To found his empire, and his town to raise, A hundred youths from all his train selects, And to the Latian court their course directs, (The spacious palace where their prince resides,) And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides. They go commission\u2019d to require a peace, And carry presents to procure access. Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs His new-elected seat, and draws the lines.", " A land there is, Hesperia call\u2019d of old, The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold. Th\u2019 Oenotrians held it once, by later fame Now call\u2019d Italia, from the leader\u2019s name. Jasius there and Dardanus were born; From thence we came, and thither must return. Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet. Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.\u2019 \u201cAstonish\u2019d at their voices and their sight, (Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night; I saw, I knew their faces, and descried, In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;) I started from my couch; a clammy sweat On all my limbs and shiv\u2019ring body sate. To heav\u2019n I lift my hands with pious haste, And sacred incense in the flames I cast. Thus to the gods their perfect honours done, More cheerful, to my good old sire I run, And tell the pleasing news. In little space He found his error of the double race; Not, as before he deem\u2019d, deriv\u2019d from Crete; No more deluded by the doubtful seat: Then said: \u2018O son, turmoil\u2019d in Trojan fate!", " At Aeneas\u2019 return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains."], "How does Ascanius inadvertently start the war?": [" And, as Aegaeon, when with heav\u2019n he strove, Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove; Mov\u2019d all his hundred hands, provok\u2019d the war, Defied the forky lightning from afar; At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires, And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires; In his right hand as many swords he wields, And takes the thunder on as many shields: With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood; And soon the fields with falling corps were strow\u2019d, When once his falchion found the taste of blood. With fury scarce to be conceiv\u2019d, he flew Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew. They, when they see the fiery chief advance, And pushing at their chests his pointed lance, Wheel\u2019d with so swift a motion, mad with fear, They threw their master headlong from the chair. They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before They bear the bounding chariot to the shore. Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains, With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins, And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains: Bold brethren both.", " To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars; Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores. The lots decide their place. Above the rest, Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest; The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows: Besmear\u2019d with oil, their naked shoulders shine. All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign: They gripe their oars; and ev\u2019ry panting breast Is rais\u2019d by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress\u2019d. The clangour of the trumpet gives the sign; At once they start, advancing in a line: With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies; Lash\u2019d with their oars, the smoky billows rise; Sparkles the briny main, and the vex\u2019d ocean fries. Exact in time, with equal strokes they row: At once the brushing oars and brazen prow Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below. Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race, Invade the field with half so swift a pace; Not the fierce driver with more fury lends The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends, Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.", " And now in pomp the peaceful kings appear: Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear; Twelve golden beams around his temples play, To mark his lineage from the God of Day. Two snowy coursers Turnus\u2019 chariot yoke, And in his hand two massy spears he shook: Then issued from the camp, in arms divine, Aeneas, author of the Roman line; And by his side Ascanius took his place, The second hope of Rome\u2019s immortal race.

Troy is too narrow for thy name.\u201d He said, And plunging downward shot his radiant head; Dispell\u2019d the breathing air, that broke his flight: Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. Old Butes\u2019 form he took, Anchises\u2019 squire, Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: \u201cSuffice it thee, thy father\u2019s worthy son, The warlike prize thou hast already won. The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. Now tempt the war no more.\u201d He said, and flew Obscure in air, and vanish\u2019d from their view.

Jupiter despatches Mercury to Aeneas, to warn him from Carthage. Aeneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister\u2019s entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But anxious cares already seiz\u2019d the queen: She fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero\u2019s valour, acts, and birth inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.

Th\u2019 Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw The mighty Thund\u2019rer with majestic awe, Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around, And scatter\u2019d tempests on the teeming ground. Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood Two stately towns, on either side the flood,) Saturnia\u2019s and Janiculum\u2019s remains; And either place the founder\u2019s name retains. Discoursing thus together, they resort Where poor Evander kept his country court. They view\u2019d the ground of Rome\u2019s litigious hall; (Once oxen low\u2019d, where now the lawyers bawl;) Then, stooping, thro\u2019 the narrow gate they press\u2019d, When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest: \u201cMean as it is, this palace, and this door, Receiv\u2019d Alcides, then a conqueror. Dare to be poor; accept our homely food, Which feasted him, and emulate a god.\u201d Then underneath a lowly roof he led The weary prince, and laid him on a bed; The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o\u2019erspread.", " Messapus and Catillus, post your force Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse. Some guard the passes, others man the wall; Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call.\u201d They swarm from ev\u2019ry quarter of the town, And with disorder\u2019d haste the rampires crown. Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late, The gath\u2019ring storm just breaking on the state, Dismiss\u2019d the council till a fitter time, And own\u2019d his easy temper as his crime, Who, forc\u2019d against his reason, had complied To break the treaty for the promis\u2019d bride. Some help to sink new trenches; others aid To ram the stones, or raise the palisade. Hoarse trumpets sound th\u2019 alarm; around the walls Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labour calls. A sad procession in the streets is seen, Of matrons, that attend the mother queen: High in her chair she sits, and, at her side, With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride. They mount the cliff, where Pallas\u2019 temple stands; Pray\u2019rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands, With censers first they fume the sacred shrine, Then in this common supplication join: \u201cO patroness of arms, unspotted maid, Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!"], "Which god turned Italy from a land of savages into a nation?": [" Much better had he curb\u2019d his high desires, And hover\u2019d o\u2019er his ill-extinguish\u2019d fires.

Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.\u2019 \u201cHe said; and we with glad consent obey, Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, We spread our sails before the willing wind. Now from the sight of land our galleys move, With only seas around and skies above; When o\u2019er our heads descends a burst of rain, And night with sable clouds involves the main; The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; The scatter\u2019d fleet is forc\u2019d to sev\u2019ral ways; The face of heav\u2019n is ravish\u2019d from our eyes, And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies.

Or, if by dearer ties you may be won, By your dead sire, and by your living son, Redeem from this reproach my wand\u2019ring ghost; Or with your navy seek the Velin coast, And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose; Or, if a nearer way your mother shows, Without whose aid you durst not undertake This frightful passage o\u2019er the Stygian lake, Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o\u2019er To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore.\u201d Scarce had he said, the prophetess began: \u201cWhat hopes delude thee, miserable man?"], "What does Vulcan begin making for Aeneas?": [" Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste, Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass\u2019d.

On their left arms their ample shields they bear, The right reclin\u2019d upon the bending spear. Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, And beg admission, eager to be heard: Th\u2019 affair important, not to be deferr\u2019d.

Much better had it been for you and me, Unforc\u2019d by this our last necessity, To have been earlier wise, than now to call A council, when the foe surrounds the wall. O citizens, we wage unequal war, With men not only Heav\u2019n\u2019s peculiar care, But Heav\u2019n\u2019s own race; unconquer\u2019d in the field, Or, conquer\u2019d, yet unknowing how to yield.", " Now hear what I revolve\u2014 A thought unripe\u2014and scarcely yet resolve.

The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d.

Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.", " Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed.

A thousand youths brave Massicus obey, Borne in the Tiger thro\u2019 the foaming sea; From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care: For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear."], "How does Juno get Turnus to leave the battle?": [" Leave what remains to me.\u201d Saturnia said: The sullen fiend her sounding wings display\u2019d, Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade. In midst of Italy, well known to fame, There lies a lake, Amsanctus is the name, Below the lofty mounts: on either side Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide. Full in the centre of the sacred wood An arm arises of the Stygian flood, Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound, Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around. Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell, And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell. To this infernal lake the Fury flies; Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab\u2019ring skies. Saturnian Juno now, with double care, Attends the fatal process of the war. The clowns, return\u2019d, from battle bear the slain, Implore the gods, and to their king complain. The corps of Almon and the rest are shown; Shrieks, clamours, murmurs, fill the frighted town.", " Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, To their expecting lord with peace return. But jealous Juno, from Pachynus\u2019 height, As she from Argos took her airy flight, Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight. She saw the Trojan and his joyful train Descend upon the shore, desert the main, Design a town, and, with unhop\u2019d success, Th\u2019 embassadors return with promis\u2019d peace. Then, pierc\u2019d with pain, she shook her haughty head, Sigh\u2019d from her inward soul, and thus she said: \u201cO hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! O fates of Troy, which Juno\u2019s fates oppose! Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, But slain revive, and, taken, scape again? When execrable Troy in ashes lay, Thro\u2019 fires and swords and seas they forc\u2019d their way. Then vanquish\u2019d Juno must in vain contend, Her rage disarm\u2019d, her empire at an end. Breathless and tir\u2019d, is all my fury spent? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?", " Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed.

Both armies now in open fields are seen; Nor far the distance of the space between. Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh.

Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied My proffer\u2019d friendship, and my promis\u2019d bride; Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try His cause in arms, to conquer or to die. My right and his are in dispute: the slain Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. In equal arms let us alone contend; And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. This is the way (so tell him) to possess The royal virgin, and restore the peace.

Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force.", " And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see A son whose death disgrac\u2019d his ancestry; Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev\u2019d: Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv\u2019d. He died no death to make thee wish, too late, Thou hadst not liv\u2019d to see his shameful fate: But what a champion has th\u2019 Ausonian coast, And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!\u201d Thus having mourn\u2019d, he gave the word around, To raise the breathless body from the ground; And chose a thousand horse, the flow\u2019r of all His warlike troops, to wait the funeral, To bear him back and share Evander\u2019s grief: A well-becoming, but a weak relief. Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier, Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear. The body on this rural hearse is borne: Strew\u2019d leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn. All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow\u2019r, New cropp\u2019d by virgin hands, to dress the bow\u2019r: Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below, No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.", " That conquer\u2019d earth be theirs, for which they fought, And which for us with their own blood they bought; But first the corpse of our unhappy friend To the sad city of Evander send, Who, not inglorious, in his age\u2019s bloom, Was hurried hence by too severe a doom.\u201d Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay. Acoetes watch\u2019d the corpse; whose youth deserv\u2019d The father\u2019s trust; and now the son he serv\u2019d With equal faith, but less auspicious care. Th\u2019 attendants of the slain his sorrow share. A troop of Trojans mix\u2019d with these appear, And mourning matrons with dishevel\u2019d hair. Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky. They rear his drooping forehead from the ground; But, when Aeneas view\u2019d the grisly wound Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore, And the fair flesh distain\u2019d with purple gore; First, melting into tears, the pious man Deplor\u2019d so sad a sight, then thus began: \u201cUnhappy youth!", " \u2019Tis long since I, for my celestial wife Loath\u2019d by the gods, have dragg\u2019d a ling\u2019ring life; Since ev\u2019ry hour and moment I expire, Blasted from heav\u2019n by Jove\u2019s avenging fire.\u2019 This oft repeated, he stood fix\u2019d to die: Myself, my wife, my son, my family, Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry. \u2018What, will he still persist, on death resolve, And in his ruin all his house involve!\u2019 He still persists his reasons to maintain; Our pray\u2019rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. \u201cUrg\u2019d by despair, again I go to try The fate of arms, resolv\u2019d in fight to die: \u2018What hope remains, but what my death must give? Can I, without so dear a father, live? You term it prudence, what I baseness call: Could such a word from such a parent fall? If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain, That nothing should of ruin\u2019d Troy remain, And you conspire with Fortune to be slain, The way to death is wide, th\u2019 approaches near: For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear, Reeking with Priam\u2019s blood: the wretch who slew The son (inhuman) in the father\u2019s view, And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew."], "What does Aeneas do that impresses the Latin messengers?": [" The captain gives command; the joyful train Glide thro\u2019 the gloomy shade, and leave the main. Now, Erato, thy poet\u2019s mind inspire, And fill his soul with thy celestial fire! Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings; Declare the past and present state of things, When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought, And how the rivals lov\u2019d, and how they fought. These are my theme, and how the war began, And how concluded by the godlike man: For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage, Which princes and their people did engage; And haughty souls, that, mov\u2019d with mutual hate, In fighting fields pursued and found their fate; That rous\u2019d the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms, And peaceful Italy involv\u2019d in arms. A larger scene of action is display\u2019d; And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh\u2019d. Latinus, old and mild, had long possess\u2019d The Latin scepter, and his people blest: His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame His mother; fair Marica was her name.", " Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus\u2019 hand, In vain the strongest of th\u2019 Arcadian band: Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford Availing aid against th\u2019 Aenean sword, Which to his naked heart pursued the course; Nor could his plated shield sustain the force. Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow\u2019rs, Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow\u2019rs, Were doom\u2019d to kill, while Heav\u2019n prolong\u2019d his date; But who can pass the bounds, prefix\u2019d by fate? In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held Two palaces, and was from each expell\u2019d: Of all the mighty man, the last remains A little spot of foreign earth contains. And now both hosts their broken troops unite In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight. Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line: Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads. They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, Resolv\u2019d on death, impatient of disgrace; And, where one falls, another fills his place.", " Beneath the walls they measure out the space; Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass, Where, with religious their common gods they place. In purest white the priests their heads attire; And living waters bear, and holy fire; And, o\u2019er their linen hoods and shaded hair, Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear. In order issuing from the town appears The Latin legion, arm\u2019d with pointed spears; And from the fields, advancing on a line, The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join: Their various arms afford a pleasing sight; A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar\u2019d for fight. Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride, Glitt\u2019ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed; Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line, And there Messapus, born of seed divine.

Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus\u2019 consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Aeneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed. Jupiter despatches Mercury to Aeneas, to warn him from Carthage. Aeneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister\u2019s entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But anxious cares already seiz\u2019d the queen: She fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero\u2019s valour, acts, and birth inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.

BOOK XI THE ARGUMENT. Aeneas erects a trophy of the spoils of Mezentius, grants a truce for burying the dead, and sends home the body of Pallas with great solemnity. Latinus calls a council, to propose offers of peace to Aeneas; which occasions great animosity betwixt Turnus and Drances. In the mean time there is a sharp engagement of the horse; wherein Camilla signalizes herself, is killed, and the Latine troops are entirely defeated. Scarce had the rosy Morning rais\u2019d her head Above the waves, and left her wat\u2019ry bed; The pious chief, whom double cares attend For his unburied soldiers and his friend, Yet first to Heav\u2019n perform\u2019d a victor\u2019s vows: He bar\u2019d an ancient oak of all her boughs; Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac\u2019d, Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac\u2019d. The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn, Now on a naked snag in triumph borne, Was hung on high, and glitter\u2019d from afar, A trophy sacred to the God of War.", " No more delays, but haste!\u201d With that, he wakes The nodding watch; each to his office takes. The guard reliev\u2019d, the gen\u2019rous couple went To find the council at the royal tent. All creatures else forgot their daily care, And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate In nightly council for th\u2019 indanger\u2019d state. They vote a message to their absent chief, Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief. Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, Remote from clamour, and secure from foes. On their left arms their ample shields they bear, The right reclin\u2019d upon the bending spear. Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, And beg admission, eager to be heard: Th\u2019 affair important, not to be deferr\u2019d. Ascanius bids \u2019em be conducted in, Ord\u2019ring the more experienc\u2019d to begin. Then Nisus thus: \u201cYe fathers, lend your ears; Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.", " Can they securely trust their feeble wall, A slight partition, a thin interval, Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho\u2019 built By hands divine, yet perish\u2019d by their guilt? Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands, To force from out their lines these dastard bands. Less than a thousand ships will end this war, Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare. Let all the Tuscans, all th\u2019 Arcadians, join! Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design. Let them not fear the treasons of the night, The robb\u2019d Palladium, the pretended flight: Our onset shall be made in open light. No wooden engine shall their town betray; Fires they shall have around, but fires by day. No Grecian babes before their camp appear, Whom Hector\u2019s arms detain\u2019d to the tenth tardy year. Now, since the sun is rolling to the west, Give we the silent night to needful rest: Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare; The morn shall end the small remains of war.\u201d The post of honour to Messapus falls, To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls, To pitch the fires at distances around, And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.", " \u201cSuch truths, O king,\u201d said he, \u201cyour words contain, As strike the sense, and all replies are vain; Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek What common needs require, but fear to speak. Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man, Whose pride this unauspicious war began; For whose ambition (let me dare to say, Fear set apart, tho\u2019 death is in my way) The plains of Latium run with blood around. So many valiant heroes bite the ground; Dejected grief in ev\u2019ry face appears; A town in mourning, and a land in tears; While he, th\u2019 undoubted author of our harms, The man who menaces the gods with arms, Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight, And sought his safety in ignoble flight. Now, best of kings, since you propose to send Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend; Add yet a greater at our joint request, One which he values more than all the rest: Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride; With that alliance let the league be tied, And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide."], "Who is left behind to defend the Latins' city?": [" Round in a spacious ring he rides the field, And vainly plies th\u2019 impenetrable shield. Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel\u2019d, Turn\u2019d as he turn\u2019d: the golden orb withstood The strokes, and bore about an iron wood. Impatient of delay, and weary grown, Still to defend, and to defend alone, To wrench the darts which in his buckler light, Urg\u2019d and o\u2019er-labour\u2019d in unequal fight; At length resolv\u2019d, he throws with all his force Full at the temples of the warrior horse. Just where the stroke was aim\u2019d, th\u2019 unerring spear Made way, and stood transfix\u2019d thro\u2019 either ear. Seiz\u2019d with unwonted pain, surpris\u2019d with fright, The wounded steed curvets, and, rais\u2019d upright, Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind. Down comes the rider headlong from his height: His horse came after with unwieldy weight, And, flound\u2019ring forward, pitching on his head, His lord\u2019s encumber\u2019d shoulder overlaid.", " For you I have provok\u2019d a tyrant\u2019s hate, Incens\u2019d the Libyan and the Tyrian state; For you alone I suffer in my fame, Bereft of honour, and expos\u2019d to shame. Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest? (That only name remains of all the rest!) What have I left? or whither can I fly?

Had you deferr\u2019d, at least, your hasty flight, And left behind some pledge of our delight, Some babe to bless the mother\u2019s mournful sight, Some young Aeneas, to supply your place, Whose features might express his father\u2019s face; I should not then complain to live bereft Of all my husband, or be wholly left.\u201d Here paus\u2019d the queen. Unmov\u2019d he holds his eyes, By Jove\u2019s command; nor suffer\u2019d love to rise, Tho\u2019 heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies: \u201cFair queen, you never can enough repeat Your boundless favours, or I own my debt; Nor can my mind forget Eliza\u2019s name, While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.", " Who has not heard the story of your woes, The name and fortune of your native place, The fame and valour of the Phrygian race?

Thither young Turnus took the well-known way, Possess\u2019d the pass, and in blind ambush lay. Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies, Beheld th\u2019 approaching war with hateful eyes, And call\u2019d the light-foot Opis to her aid, Her most belov\u2019d and ever-trusty maid; Then with a sigh began: \u201cCamilla goes To meet her death amidst her fatal foes: The nymphs I lov\u2019d of all my mortal train, Invested with Diana\u2019s arms, in vain.

Then, thro\u2019 the gate of iv\u2019ry, he dismiss\u2019d His valiant offspring and divining guest. Straight to the ships Aeneas took his way, Embark\u2019d his men, and skimm\u2019d along the sea, Still coasting, till he gain\u2019d Cajeta\u2019s bay.

King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother, and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes; whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related.

Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his entertainment. Juno, by Venus\u2019 consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives Aeneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed. Jupiter despatches Mercury to Aeneas, to warn him from Carthage. Aeneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister\u2019s entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes. But anxious cares already seiz\u2019d the queen: She fed within her veins a flame unseen; The hero\u2019s valour, acts, and birth inspire Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, Improve the passion, and increase the smart.", " But if it climb, with your assisting hands, The Trojan walls, and in the city stands; Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn, And the reverse of fate on us return.\u2019 \u201cWith such deceits he gain\u2019d their easy hearts, Too prone to credit his perfidious arts. What Diomede, nor Thetis\u2019 greater son, A thousand ships, nor ten years\u2019 siege, had done: False tears and fawning words the city won. \u201cA greater omen, and of worse portent, Did our unwary minds with fear torment, Concurring to produce the dire event. Laocoon, Neptune\u2019s priest by lot that year, With solemn pomp then sacrific\u2019d a steer; When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied Two serpents, rank\u2019d abreast, the seas divide, And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. Their flaming crests above the waves they show; Their bellies seem to burn the seas below; Their speckled tails advance to steer their course, And on the sounding shore the flying billows force."], "Who is Aeneas's primary enemy in Italy?": [" Not far from hence, along the river\u2019s side, In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide, By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground, Aeneas cast his wond\u2019ring eyes around, And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight, Stretch\u2019d on the spacious plain from left to right. Thither his warlike train the Trojan led, Refresh\u2019d his men, and wearied horses fed. Meantime the mother goddess, crown\u2019d with charms, Breaks thro\u2019 the clouds, and brings the fated arms. Within a winding vale she finds her son, On the cool river\u2019s banks, retir\u2019d alone. She shews her heav\u2019nly form without disguise, And gives herself to his desiring eyes. \u201cBehold,\u201d she said, \u201cperform\u2019d in ev\u2019ry part, My promise made, and Vulcan\u2019s labour\u2019d art. Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy, And haughty Turnus to the field defy.\u201d She said; and, having first her son embrac\u2019d, The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac\u2019d, Proud of the gift, he roll\u2019d his greedy sight Around the work, and gaz\u2019d with vast delight.", " His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; His mother was a huntress of the wood, And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, But better skill\u2019d unerring shafts to send. Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend: Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast. Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. One was their care, and their delight was one: One common hazard in the war they shar\u2019d, And now were both by choice upon the guard. Then Nisus thus: \u201cOr do the gods inspire This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? A gen\u2019rous ardour boils within my breast, Eager of action, enemy to rest: This urges me to fight, and fires my mind To leave a memorable name behind. Thou see\u2019st the foe secure; how faintly shine Their scatter\u2019d fires! the most, in sleep supine Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; All hush\u2019d around.", " He heav\u2019d it at a lift, and, pois\u2019d on high, Ran stagg\u2019ring on against his enemy, But so disorder\u2019d, that he scarcely knew His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw. His knocking knees are bent beneath the load, And shiv\u2019ring cold congeals his vital blood. The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short For want of vigour, mocks his vain effort. And as, when heavy sleep has clos\u2019d the sight, The sickly fancy labours in the night; We seem to run; and, destitute of force, Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course: In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry; The nerves, unbrac\u2019d, their usual strength deny; And on the tongue the falt\u2019ring accents die: So Turnus far\u2019d; whatever means he tried, All force of arms and points of art employ\u2019d, The Fury flew athwart, and made th\u2019 endeavor void. A thousand various thoughts his soul confound; He star\u2019d about, nor aid nor issue found; His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.", " BOOK V THE ARGUMENT.

Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a noble episode. The gates of heav\u2019n unfold: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall. Sublimely seated, he surveys from far The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, And all th\u2019 inferior world. From first to last, The sov\u2019reign senate in degrees are plac\u2019d. Then thus th\u2019 almighty sire began: \u201cYe gods, Natives or denizens of blest abodes, From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, This backward fate from what was first design\u2019d? Why this protracted war, when my commands Pronounc\u2019d a peace, and gave the Latian lands? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav\u2019ns, and arms our powers on diff\u2019rent sides? A lawful time of war at length will come, (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.", " You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post. More formidable Hydra stands within, Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin. The gaping gulf low to the centre lies, And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies. The rivals of the gods, the Titan race, Here, sing\u2019d with lightning, roll within th\u2019 unfathom\u2019d space. Here lie th\u2019 Alaean twins, (I saw them both,) Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth, Who dar\u2019d in fight the Thund\u2019rer to defy, Affect his heav\u2019n, and force him from the sky. Salmoneus, suff\u2019ring cruel pains, I found, For emulating Jove; the rattling sound Of mimic thunder, and the glitt\u2019ring blaze Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays. Thro\u2019 Elis and the Grecian towns he flew; Th\u2019 audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew: He wav\u2019d a torch aloft, and, madly vain, Sought godlike worship from a servile train. Ambitious fool!", " The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations. Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of his posterity. When Turnus had assembled all his pow\u2019rs, His standard planted on Laurentum\u2019s tow\u2019rs; When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, Had giv\u2019n the signal of approaching war, Had rous\u2019d the neighing steeds to scour the fields, While the fierce riders clatter\u2019d on their shields; Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare To join th\u2019 allies, and headlong rush to war. Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, With bold Mezentius, who blasphem\u2019d aloud. These thro\u2019 the country took their wasteful course, The fields to forage, and to gather force.", " Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn, And on your friends your fatal fury turn. Behold your own Ascanius!\u201d While he said, He drew his glitt\u2019ring helmet from his head, In which the youths to sportful arms he led. By this, Aeneas and his train appear; And now the women, seiz\u2019d with shame and fear, Dispers\u2019d, to woods and caverns take their flight, Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; Their friends acknowledge, and their error find, And shake the goddess from their alter\u2019d mind. Not so the raging fires their fury cease, But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, Work on their way amid the smould\u2019ring tow, Sure in destruction, but in motion slow. The silent plague thro\u2019 the green timber eats, And vomits out a tardy flame by fits. Down to the keels, and upward to the sails, The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; Nor buckets pour\u2019d, nor strength of human hand, Can the victorious element withstand."], "What is the role of homeland in The Aeneid?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AENEID *** Produced by Anonymous Volunteers and David Widger THE AENEID by Virgil Translated by John Dryden Contents BOOK I BOOK II BOOK III BOOK IV BOOK V BOOK VI BOOK VII BOOK VIII BOOK IX BOOK X BOOK XI BOOK XII BOOK I THE ARGUMENT. The Trojans, after a seven years\u2019 voyage, set sail for Italy, but are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Aeolus raises at the request of Juno. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune drives off the winds, and calms the sea. Aeneas, with his own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains to Jupiter of her son\u2019s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians. Aeneas, going out to discover the country, meets his mother in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and receives a kind entertainment from the queen."], "Why does Aeneas decide to kill Turnus at the end of the poem?": [" Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. Thro\u2019 the black forest and the ferny brake, Unknowingly secure, their way they take; From the rough mountains to the plain descend, And there, in order drawn, their line extend. Both armies now in open fields are seen; Nor far the distance of the space between. Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, Thro\u2019 smoking fields, his hast\u2019ning enemies; And Turnus views the Trojans in array, And hears th\u2019 approaching horses proudly neigh.

BOOK XII THE ARGUMENT. Turnus challenges Aeneas to a single combat: articles are agreed on, but broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus, forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death.", " What god can tell, what numbers can display, The various labours of that fatal day; What chiefs and champions fell on either side, In combat slain, or by what deaths they died; Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill\u2019d; Who shar\u2019d the fame and fortune of the field! Jove, could\u2019st thou view, and not avert thy sight, Two jarring nations join\u2019d in cruel fight, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite! Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found, Whose valour made the Trojans quit their ground; Betwixt his ribs the jav\u2019lin drove so just, It reach\u2019d his heart, nor needs a second thrust. Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew; First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw: Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail\u2019d Diores, and in equal fight prevail\u2019d. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place; Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace. Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw, Whom without respite at one charge he slew: Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress\u2019d, And sad Onythes, added to the rest, Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore.", " Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num\u2019rous train, Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take, And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake. A cloud of blinding dust is rais\u2019d around, Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground. Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far Beheld the progress of the moving war: With him the Latins view\u2019d the cover\u2019d plains, And the chill blood ran backward in their veins. Juturna saw th\u2019 advancing troops appear, And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear. Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train, Clos\u2019d in their ranks, and pouring on the plain. As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore From the mid ocean, drives the waves before; The painful hind with heavy heart foresees The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees; With like impetuous rage the prince appears Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears. And now both armies shock in open field; Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill\u2019d.", " This end the sessions had: the senate rise, And to his palace wait their sov\u2019reign thro\u2019 the skies. Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes Within their walls the Trojan host inclose: They wound, they kill, they watch at ev\u2019ry gate; Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate. Th\u2019 Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief, Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief. Thin on the tow\u2019rs they stand; and ev\u2019n those few A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew. Yet in the face of danger some there stood: The two bold brothers of Sarpedon\u2019s blood, Asius and Acmon; both th\u2019 Assaraci; Young Haemon, and tho\u2019 young, resolv\u2019d to die. With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join\u2019d; Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind. From Acmon\u2019s hands a rolling stone there came, So large, it half deserv\u2019d a mountain\u2019s name: Strong-sinew\u2019d was the youth, and big of bone; His brother Mnestheus could not more have done, Or the great father of th\u2019 intrepid son."], "What is the golden bough a sign of?": [" Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, And throats of brass, inspir\u2019d with iron lungs, I could not half those horrid crimes repeat, Nor half the punishments those crimes have met. But let us haste our voyage to pursue: The walls of Pluto\u2019s palace are in view; The gate, and iron arch above it, stands On anvils labour\u2019d by the Cyclops\u2019 hands. Before our farther way the Fates allow, Here must we fix on high the golden bough.\u201d She said, and thro\u2019 the gloomy shades they pass\u2019d, And chose the middle path. Arriv\u2019d at last, The prince with living water sprinkled o\u2019er His limbs and body; then approach\u2019d the door, Possess\u2019d the porch, and on the front above He fix\u2019d the fatal bough requir\u2019d by Pluto\u2019s love. These holy rites perform\u2019d, they took their way Where long extended plains of pleasure lay: The verdant fields with those of heav\u2019n may vie, With ether vested, and a purple sky; The blissful seats of happy souls below.", " The queen at length appears; on either hand The brawny guards in martial order stand. A flow\u2019r\u2019d simar with golden fringe she wore, And at her back a golden quiver bore; Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains, A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains. Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase. But far above the rest in beauty shines The great Aeneas, the troop he joins; Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost Of wint\u2019ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast, When to his native Delos he resorts, Ordains the dances, and renews the sports; Where painted Scythians, mix\u2019d with Cretan bands, Before the joyful altars join their hands: Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below The merry madness of the sacred show. Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; A golden fillet binds his awful brows; His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen In manly presence, or in lofty mien.", " These in my name are listed; and my son As many more has added in his own.\u201d Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest, With downcast eyes, their silent grief express\u2019d; Who, short of succours, and in deep despair, Shook at the dismal prospect of the war. But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud, To cheer her issue, thunder\u2019d thrice aloud; Thrice forky lightning flash\u2019d along the sky, And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear; And, in a heav\u2019n serene, refulgent arms appear: Redd\u2019ning the skies, and glitt\u2019ring all around, The temper\u2019d metals clash, and yield a silver sound. The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine; Aeneas only, conscious to the sign, Presag\u2019d th\u2019 event, and joyful view\u2019d, above, Th\u2019 accomplish\u2019d promise of the Queen of Love. Then, to th\u2019 Arcadian king: \u201cThis prodigy (Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me. Heav\u2019n calls me to the war: th\u2019 expected sign Is giv\u2019n of promis\u2019d aid, and arms divine.", " He knew his mother\u2019s birds; and thus he pray\u2019d: \u201cBe you my guides, with your auspicious aid, And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, Whose glitt\u2019ring shadow gilds the sacred ground. And thou, great parent, with celestial care, In this distress be present to my pray\u2019r!\u201d Thus having said, he stopp\u2019d with watchful sight, Observing still the motions of their flight, What course they took, what happy signs they shew. They fed, and, flutt\u2019ring, by degrees withdrew Still farther from the place, but still in view: Hopping and flying, thus they led him on To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun They wing\u2019d their flight aloft; then, stooping low, Perch\u2019d on the double tree that bears the golden bough. Thro\u2019 the green leafs the glitt\u2019ring shadows glow; As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe, Where the proud mother views her precious brood, And happier branches, which she never sow\u2019d."], "Why does Aeneas take the hearth gods with him when he leaves Troy?": [" Thou call\u2019st my lost Astyanax to mind; In thee his features and his form I find: His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame; Such were his motions; such was all his frame; And ah! had Heav\u2019n so pleas\u2019d, his years had been the same.\u2019 \u201cWith tears I took my last adieu, and said: \u2018Your fortune, happy pair, already made, Leaves you no farther wish. My diff\u2019rent state, Avoiding one, incurs another fate. To you a quiet seat the gods allow: You have no shores to search, no seas to plow, Nor fields of flying Italy to chase: (Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!) You see another Simois, and enjoy The labour of your hands, another Troy, With better auspice than her ancient tow\u2019rs, And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow\u2019rs. If e\u2019er the gods, whom I with vows adore, Conduct my steps to Tiber\u2019s happy shore; If ever I ascend the Latian throne, And build a city I may call my own; As both of us our birth from Troy derive, So let our kindred lines in concord live, And both in acts of equal friendship strive.", " He, when he saw his regal town on fire, His ruin\u2019d palace, and his ent\u2019ring foes, On ev\u2019ry side inevitable woes, In arms, disus\u2019d, invests his limbs, decay\u2019d, Like them, with age; a late and useless aid. His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain; Loaded, not arm\u2019d, he creeps along with pain, Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain! Uncover\u2019d but by heav\u2019n, there stood in view An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew, Dodder\u2019d with age, whose boughs encompass round The household gods, and shade the holy ground. Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain. Driv\u2019n like a flock of doves along the sky, Their images they hug, and to their altars fly. The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord, And hanging by his side a heavy sword, \u2018What rage,\u2019 she cried, \u2018has seiz\u2019d my husband\u2019s mind? What arms are these, and to what use design\u2019d? These times want other aids!", " To their united force it yields, tho\u2019 late, And mourns with mortal groans th\u2019 approaching fate: The roots no more their upper load sustain; But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro\u2019 the plain. \u201cDescending thence, I scape thro\u2019 foes and fire: Before the goddess, foes and flames retire. Arriv\u2019d at home, he, for whose only sake, Or most for his, such toils I undertake, The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight, I purpos\u2019d to secure on Ida\u2019s height, Refus\u2019d the journey, resolute to die And add his fun\u2019rals to the fate of Troy, Rather than exile and old age sustain. \u2018Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev\u2019ry vein. Had Heav\u2019n decreed that I should life enjoy, Heav\u2019n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. \u2019Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, And give this useless corpse a long adieu. These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; At least the pitying foes will aid my death, To take my spoils, and leave my body bare: As for my sepulcher, let Heav\u2019n take care.", " Patient of command In time he grew, and, growing us\u2019d to hand, He waited at his master\u2019s board for food; Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood, Where grazing all the day, at night he came To his known lodgings, and his country dame. This household beast, that us\u2019d the woodland grounds, Was view\u2019d at first by the young hero\u2019s hounds, As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat In the cool waters, and to quench his heat. Ascanius young, and eager of his game, Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim; But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides, Which pierc\u2019d his bowels thro\u2019 his panting sides. The bleeding creature issues from the floods, Possess\u2019d with fear, and seeks his known abodes, His old familiar hearth and household gods. He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans, Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans. Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud For succour from the clownish neighbourhood: The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay In the close woody covert, urg\u2019d their way."]}
