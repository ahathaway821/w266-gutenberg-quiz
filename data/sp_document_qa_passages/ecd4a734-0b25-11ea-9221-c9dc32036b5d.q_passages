But in this scene there are no rhyming lines except the couplet at the end. On the whole, it seems likely that the name was altered in the stage copies at the instance of some person of the name of Brook living at Windsor, who had sufficient acquaintance with the players, or interest with their patrons, to get it done.

It is impossible else to account for the sudden change of tone. It might have been conjectured that, being a parson, he wished to appear peacefully minded, and therefore made his offers of reconciliation aloud and his menaces in an under tone, but Caius\u2019s reply shews that it was the threat which had been made aloud.", " PAGE, } WILLIAM PAGE, a boy, son to Page.

Recent Editors have generally given them to _Anne_, on the ground that it is proved by IV. 6. 20 and V. 3. 11, 12, that she was to \u2018present the Fairy Queen,\u2019 and that the character of the speeches is unsuitable to Mrs Quickly. It has been argued, too, that the _Qui._ of the folios, line 35, may be a misprint for _Qu._, i.e. _Queen_. This however is contradicted by the fact that Mrs Quickly plays the Queen in the early Quartos, and that the recurrence of _Qui._, line 88, proves that the printer of the first Folio used either _Qui._ or _Qu._ indifferently as the abbreviation of _Quickly_. Most likely, in this and other respects the play was altered by its author, but the stage MSS. were not corrected throughout with sufficient care. This will account for the mistake about the colours \u2018green\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 in the final scene, lines 186, 190, 196.", " _Page._ Why, yet there want not many that do fear In deep of night to walk by this Herne\u2019s oak: But what of this? _Mrs Ford._ Marry, this is our device; 40 That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us. _Page._ Well, let it not be doubted but he\u2019ll come: And in this shape when you have brought him thither, What shall be done with him? what is your plot? _Mrs Page._ That likewise have we thought upon, and thus: 45 Nan Page my daughter and my little son And three or four more of their growth we\u2019ll dress Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white, With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads, And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden, 50 As Falstaff, she, and I, are newly met, Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once With some diffused song: upon their sight, We two in great amazedness will fly: Then let them all encircle him about, 55 And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight; And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel, In their so sacred paths he dares to tread In shape profane.", " Am I a woodman, ha?

By gar, I am cozened: I ha\u2019 married un gar\u00e7on, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened. 195 _Mrs Page._ Why, did you take her in green? _Caius._ Ay, by gar, and \u2019tis a boy: by gar, I\u2019ll raise all Windsor. [_Exit._ _Ford._ This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne? _Page._ My heart misgives me:--here comes Master 200 Fenton. _Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE._ How now, Master Fenton! _Anne._ Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon! _Page._ Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?", " _Quick._ Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer! _Caius._ Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if 110 I have not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door. Follow my heels, Rugby. [_Exeunt Caius and Rugby._ _Quick._ You shall have An fool\u2019s-head of your own. No, I know Anne\u2019s mind for that: never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne\u2019s mind than I do; nor can 115 do more than I do with her, I thank heaven. _Fent._ [_Within_] Who\u2019s within there? ho! _Quick._ Who\u2019s there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray you. _Enter FENTON._ _Fent._ How now, good woman! how dost thou? 120 _Quick._ The better that it pleases your good worship to ask. _Fen._ What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne? _Quick._ In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you that by 125 the way; I praise heaven for it.", " _Quick._ [_Aside to Simple_] Are you avised o\u2019 that? you 90 shall find it a great charge: and to be up early and down late;--but notwithstanding,--to tell you in your ear; I would have no words of it,--my master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but notwithstanding that, I know Anne\u2019s mind,--that\u2019s neither here nor there. 95 _Caius._ You jack\u2019nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in de park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good you tarry here. --By gar, I will cut all his two stones; by gar, he shall not 100 have a stone to throw at his dog. [_Exit Simple._ _Quick._ Alas, he speaks but for his friend. _Caius._ It is no matter-a ver dat:--do not you tell-a me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself?--By gar, I vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine host of de 105 Jarteer to measure our weapon:--By gar, I will myself have Anne Page."], "What does Mistress Quickly say they will do to Falstaff to prove whether or not he is corrupt?": [" Away; disperse: but till \u2019tis one o\u2019clock, Our dance of custom round about the oak Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget. _Evans._ Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set; 75 And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be, To guide our measure round about the tree.-- But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth. _Fal._ Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he transform me to a piece of cheese! 80 _Pist._ Vile worm, thou wast o\u2019erlook\u2019d even in thy birth. _Quick._ With trial-fire touch me his finger-end: If he be chaste, the flame will back descend, And turn him to no pain; but if he start, It is the flesh of a corrupted heart. 85 _Pist._ A trial, come. _Evans._ Come, will this wood take fire? [_They burn him with their tapers._ _Fal._ Oh, Oh, Oh! _Quick._ Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire! About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme; And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.", " [_Exit._ _First Serv._ Come, come, take it up. _Sec. Serv._ Pray heaven it be not full of knight again. _First Serv._ I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead. _Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS._ _Ford._ Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you 100 any way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket, villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!--O you panderly rascals! there\u2019s a knot, a ging, a pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil be shamed. --What, wife, I say!--Come, come forth! Behold what honest 105 clothes you send forth to bleaching! _Page._ Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go loose any longer; you must be pinioned. _Evans._ Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog! 110 _Shal._ Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed. _Ford._ So say I too, sir. _Re-enter MISTRESS FORD._ Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford, the honest woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that hath the jealous fool to her husband!", " Whether had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master\u2019s heels? _Rob._ I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf. 5 _Mrs Page._ O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you\u2019ll be a courtier. _Enter FORD._ _Ford._ Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you? _Mrs Page._ Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home? _Ford._ Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for 10 want of company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two would marry. _Mrs Page._ Be sure of that,--two other husbands. _Ford._ Where had you this pretty weathercock? _Mrs Page._ I cannot tell what the dickens his name is 15 husband had him of. --What do you call your knight\u2019s name, sirrah? _Rob._ Sir John Falstaff. _Ford._ Sir John Falstaff! _Mrs Page._ He, he; I can never hit on\u2019s name. There 20 is such a league between my good man and he!--Is your wife at home indeed? _Ford._ Indeed she is.", " _Mrs Ford._ Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page. 65 _Fal._ Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln. _Mrs Ford._ Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one day find it. 70 _Fal._ Keep in that mind; I\u2019ll deserve it. _Mrs Ford._ Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind. _Rob._ [_Within_] Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here\u2019s Mistress Page at the door, sweating, and blowing, and 75 looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently. _Fal._ She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras. _Mrs Ford._ Pray you, do so: she\u2019s a very tattling woman.

He doth object I am too great of birth; And that, my state being gall\u2019d with my expense, 5 I seek to heal it only by his wealth: Besides these, other bars he lays before me,-- My riots past, my wild societies; And tells me \u2019tis a thing impossible I should love thee but as a property. 10 _Anne._ May be he tells you true. _Fent._ No, heaven so speed me in my time to come! Albeit I will confess thy father\u2019s wealth Was the first motive that I woo\u2019d thee, Anne: Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value 15 Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags; And \u2019tis the very riches of thyself That now I aim at.", " _Mrs Ford._ And till he tell the truth, Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound, 60 And burn him with their tapers. _Mrs Page._ The truth being known, We\u2019ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit, And mock him home to Windsor. _Ford._ The children must Be practised well to this, or they\u2019ll ne\u2019er do\u2019t. _Evans._ I will teach the children their behaviours; and 65 I will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my taber. _Ford._ That will be excellent. I\u2019ll go and buy them vizards. _Mrs Page._ My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies, 70 Finely attired in a robe of white. _Page._ That silk will I go buy. [_Aside_] And in that time Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away, And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight. _Ford._ Nay, I\u2019ll to him again in name of Brook: 75 He\u2019ll tell me all his purpose: sure, he\u2019ll come. _Mrs Page._ Fear not you that.

I will never take you for my love again; but I will always count you my deer. 115 _Fal._ I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass. _Ford._ Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant. _Fal._ And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers, 120 drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they were fairies.", " _Fal._ Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught me more wit than ever I learned before in my 55 life; and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for my learning. _Enter BARDOLPH._ _Bard._ Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage! _Host._ Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto. 60 _Bard._ Run away with the cozeners: for so soon as I came beyond Eton, they threw me off, from behind one of them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses. _Host._ They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do 65 not say they be fled; Germans are honest men. _Enter SIR HUGH EVANS._ _Evans._ Where is mine host? _Host._ What is the matter, sir? _Evans._ Have a care of your entertainments: there is a friend of mine come to town, tells me there is three 70 cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and money."]}
