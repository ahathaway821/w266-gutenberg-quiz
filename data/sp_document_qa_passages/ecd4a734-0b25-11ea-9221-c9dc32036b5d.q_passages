I do not think the knight 155 would offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men; very rogues, now they be out of service. _Ford._ Were they his men? _Page._ Marry, were they. 160 _Ford._ I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter? _Page._ Ay, marry, does he.

I fear you love Mistress Page. 65 _Fal._ Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln. _Mrs Ford._ Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one day find it. 70 _Fal._ Keep in that mind; I\u2019ll deserve it. _Mrs Ford._ Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind. _Rob._ [_Within_] Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here\u2019s Mistress Page at the door, sweating, and blowing, and 75 looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently. _Fal._ She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras. _Mrs Ford._ Pray you, do so: she\u2019s a very tattling woman.

If it had not been i\u2019 the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and \u2019tis a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Page._ Upon my life, then, you took the wrong. 180 _Slen._ What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman\u2019s apparel, I would not have had him. _Page._ Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments? 185 _Slen._ I went to her in white, and cried \u2018mum,\u2019 and she cried \u2018budget,\u2019 as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Mrs Page._ Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose; turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, 190 she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married. _Enter CAIUS._ _Caius._ Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha\u2019 married un gar\u00e7on, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened. 195 _Mrs Page._ Why, did you take her in green? _Caius._ Ay, by gar, and \u2019tis a boy: by gar, I\u2019ll raise all Windsor.", " _Shal._ Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid? _Slen._ I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease 225 it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another; I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt: but if you say, \u2018Marry her,\u2019 I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely. _Evans._ It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in 230 the ort \u2018dissolutely:\u2019 the ort is, according to our meaning, \u2018resolutely:\u2019 his meaning is good. _Shal._ Ay, I think my cousin meant well. _Slen._ Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la! _Shal._ Here comes fair Mistress Anne. 235 _Re-enter ANNE PAGE._ Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne! _Anne._ The dinner is on the table; my father desires your worships\u2019 company. _Shal._ I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne. _Evans._ Od\u2019s plessed will! I will not be absence at the 240 grace.

Mr Staunton is unquestionably right in supposing that one part of Evans\u2019s speech is spoken aside to his opponent, and the other part aloud. It is impossible else to account for the sudden change of tone. It might have been conjectured that, being a parson, he wished to appear peacefully minded, and therefore made his offers of reconciliation aloud and his menaces in an under tone, but Caius\u2019s reply shews that it was the threat which had been made aloud. Evans\u2019s valour, it would seem, had already evaporated when he had \u2018a great dispositions to cry\u2019 (III. 1. 20) and, besides, he had just begun to see that he was being made a laughing-stock. As his former speech (74, 75,) is also conciliatory, it was probably spoken so as to be heard by Caius only. He wished to keep up his credit for courage in the eyes of the bystanders. In the corresponding scene of the first Quartos we have the words \u2018Hark van urd in your ear,\u2019 and the meaning of the text may have been obscured by some omission in the Folio. NOTE VIII. IV. 4. 41. No doubt there is an omission here in the Folio, which may be partly supplied from the Quarto. But it is probable that Mrs Ford gave a still fuller explanation of her device and the grounds on which the disguise was recommended to Falstaff, otherwise Page would not have been so confident of his falling into the snare. NOTE IX. IV. 5. 49. In the edition of 1778 Steevens reads \u2018Ay, sir Tike, like\u2019 ... but it is clear from Farmer\u2019s note that it should be \u2018Ay, sir Tike,\u2019 ... and so it is corrected in the later Editions of Steevens."], "When Mistress Page and Mistress Ford get Falstaff's letter, what do they think?": [" _Fal._ Well, Mistress Ford;--what of her? 50 _Quick._ Why, sir, she\u2019s a good creature. --Lord, Lord! your worship\u2019s a wanton!

Yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, 60 gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of the best and the fairest, that would have won any woman\u2019s heart; and, I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her: I 65 had myself twenty angels given me this morning; but I defy all angels--in any such sort, as they say--but in the way of honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which is more, pensioners; 70 but, I warrant you, all is one with her. _Fal._ But what says she to me? be brief, my good she-Mercury. _Quick._ Marry, she hath received your letter; for the which she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you 75 to notify, that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.", " I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe 55 were not, Nature thy friend.

If I find not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of me, \u2018As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow walnut for his wife\u2019s 145 leman.\u2019 Satisfy me once more; once more search with me.", " _Mrs Ford._ Why, does he talk of him? 25 _Mrs Page._ Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now here; and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport, to make another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad the 30 knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery. _Mrs Ford._ How near is he, Mistress Page? _Mrs Page._ Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon. _Mrs Ford._ I am undone!--the knight is here. _Mrs Page._ Why, then, you are utterly shamed, and 35 he\u2019s but a dead man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away with him! better shame than murder. _Mrs Ford._ Which way should he go? how should I bestow him? Shall I put him into the basket again? _Re-enter FALSTAFF._ _Fal._ No, I\u2019ll come no more i\u2019 the basket. May I not 40 go out ere he come? _Mrs Page._ Alas, three of Master Ford\u2019s brothers watch the door with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here? 45 _Fal._ What shall I do?--I\u2019ll creep up into the chimney. _Mrs Ford._ There they always use to discharge their birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole. _Fal._ Where is it? _Mrs Ford._ He will seek there, on my word. Neither 50 press, coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an abstract for the remembrance of such places, and goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.", " I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe 55 were not, Nature thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it. _Mrs Ford._ Believe me, there\u2019s no such thing in me. _Fal._ What made me love thee? let that persuade thee there\u2019s something extraordinary in thee. Come, I cannot cog, and say thou art this and that, like a many of these 60 lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like women in men\u2019s apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none but thee; and thou deservest it. _Mrs Ford._ Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page. 65 _Fal._ Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek of a lime-kiln. _Mrs Ford._ Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one day find it. 70 _Fal._ Keep in that mind; I\u2019ll deserve it. _Mrs Ford._ Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not be in that mind. _Rob._ [_Within_] Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here\u2019s Mistress Page at the door, sweating, and blowing, and 75 looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently. _Fal._ She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras. _Mrs Ford._ Pray you, do so: she\u2019s a very tattling woman. [_Falstaff hides himself._ 80 _Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN._ What\u2019s the matter? how now! _Mrs Page._ O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You\u2019re shamed, you\u2019re overthrown, you\u2019re undone for ever! _Mrs Ford._ What\u2019s the matter, good Mistress Page?"], "What is Page's response?": [" Whether had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master\u2019s heels? _Rob._ I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf. 5 _Mrs Page._ O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you\u2019ll be a courtier. _Enter FORD._ _Ford._ Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you? _Mrs Page._ Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home? _Ford._ Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for 10 want of company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two would marry. _Mrs Page._ Be sure of that,--two other husbands. _Ford._ Where had you this pretty weathercock? _Mrs Page._ I cannot tell what the dickens his name is 15 husband had him of. --What do you call your knight\u2019s name, sirrah? _Rob._ Sir John Falstaff. _Ford._ Sir John Falstaff! _Mrs Page._ He, he; I can never hit on\u2019s name. There 20 is such a league between my good man and he!--Is your wife at home indeed? _Ford._ Indeed she is. _Mrs Page._ By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her. [_Exeunt Mrs Page and Robin._ _Ford._ Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath 25 he any thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out his wife\u2019s inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she\u2019s going to my wife, and Falstaff\u2019s boy 30 with her.

I would all of the same strain were in the same distress. _Mrs Ford._ I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff\u2019s being here; for I never saw him so gross 165 in his jealousy till now. _Mrs Page._ I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine. _Mrs Ford._ Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress 170 Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water; and give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment? _Mrs Page._ We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow, eight o\u2019clock, to have amends.", " _Fal._ I\u2019ll go out, then. _Mrs Page._ If you go out in your own semblance, you 55 die, Sir John.

Mr Staunton is unquestionably right in supposing that one part of Evans\u2019s speech is spoken aside to his opponent, and the other part aloud. It is impossible else to account for the sudden change of tone. It might have been conjectured that, being a parson, he wished to appear peacefully minded, and therefore made his offers of reconciliation aloud and his menaces in an under tone, but Caius\u2019s reply shews that it was the threat which had been made aloud. Evans\u2019s valour, it would seem, had already evaporated when he had \u2018a great dispositions to cry\u2019 (III. 1. 20) and, besides, he had just begun to see that he was being made a laughing-stock. As his former speech (74, 75,) is also conciliatory, it was probably spoken so as to be heard by Caius only. He wished to keep up his credit for courage in the eyes of the bystanders. In the corresponding scene of the first Quartos we have the words \u2018Hark van urd in your ear,\u2019 and the meaning of the text may have been obscured by some omission in the Folio. NOTE VIII. IV. 4. 41. No doubt there is an omission here in the Folio, which may be partly supplied from the Quarto. But it is probable that Mrs Ford gave a still fuller explanation of her device and the grounds on which the disguise was recommended to Falstaff, otherwise Page would not have been so confident of his falling into the snare. NOTE IX. IV. 5. 49. In the edition of 1778 Steevens reads \u2018Ay, sir Tike, like\u2019 ... but it is clear from Farmer\u2019s note that it should be \u2018Ay, sir Tike,\u2019 ... and so it is corrected in the later Editions of Steevens.", " And Falstaff\u2019s boy with her!

If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and \u2019tis a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Page._ Upon my life, then, you took the wrong. 180 _Slen._ What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman\u2019s apparel, I would not have had him. _Page._ Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments? 185 _Slen._ I went to her in white, and cried \u2018mum,\u2019 and she cried \u2018budget,\u2019 as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Mrs Page._ Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose; turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, 190 she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married. _Enter CAIUS._ _Caius._ Vere is Mistress Page?

Good Master Fenton, I will not be your friend nor enemy: My daughter will I question how she loves you, And as I find her, so am I affected. 90 Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in; Her father will be angry. _Fent._ Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her. 85 _Quick._ Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you, too: and let me tell you in your ear, she\u2019s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as 90 any is in Windsor, whoe\u2019er be the other: and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home; but, she hopes, there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man: surely, I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth. 95 _Fal._ Not I, I assure thee: setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms. _Quick._ Blessing on your heart for\u2019t! _Fal._ But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford\u2019s wife and Page\u2019s wife acquainted each other how they love me? 100 _Quick._ That were a jest indeed! they have not so little grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed!

Whither go you? _Mrs Page._ Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home? _Ford._ Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for 10 want of company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two would marry. _Mrs Page._ Be sure of that,--two other husbands. _Ford._ Where had you this pretty weathercock? _Mrs Page._ I cannot tell what the dickens his name is 15 husband had him of. --What do you call your knight\u2019s name, sirrah? _Rob._ Sir John Falstaff. _Ford._ Sir John Falstaff! _Mrs Page._ He, he; I can never hit on\u2019s name.

[_Exeunt Page, Caius, and Evans._ _Mrs Page._ Is there not a double excellency in this? 155 _Mrs Ford._ I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir John. _Mrs Page._ What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket! _Mrs Ford._ I am half afraid he will have need of washing; 160 so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit. _Mrs Page._ Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the same distress. _Mrs Ford._ I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff\u2019s being here; for I never saw him so gross 165 in his jealousy till now. _Mrs Page._ I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine. _Mrs Ford._ Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress 170 Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water; and give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment? _Mrs Page._ We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow, eight o\u2019clock, to have amends.", " _Fal._ I\u2019ll go out, then. _Mrs Page._ If you go out in your own semblance, you 55 die, Sir John.

There is no woman\u2019s gown big enough for him; otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so escape. 60 _Fal._ Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather than a mischief. _Mrs Ford._ My maid\u2019s aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a gown above. _Mrs Page._ On my word, it will serve him; she\u2019s as big 65 as he is: and there\u2019s her thrummed hat, and her muffler too. Run up, Sir John. _Mrs Ford._ Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will look some linen for your head. _Mrs Page._ Quick, quick! we\u2019ll come dress you straight: 70 put on the gown the while. [_Exit Falstaff._ _Mrs Ford._ I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears she\u2019s a witch; forbade her my house, and hath threatened to beat her. 75 _Mrs Page._ Heaven guide him to thy husband\u2019s cudgel, and the devil guide his cudgel afterwards! _Mrs Ford._ But is my husband coming? _Mrs Page._ Ay, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket too, howsoever he hath had intelligence. 80 _Mrs Ford._ We\u2019ll try that; for I\u2019ll appoint my men to carry the basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as they did last time. _Mrs Page._ Nay, but he\u2019ll be here presently: let\u2019s go dress him like the witch of Brentford."], "How does Falstaff sneak out of the house the first time he visits Mistress Ford?": [" _Re-enter MISTRESS FORD._ Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford, the honest woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that hath the jealous fool to her husband!

Come away. 125 _Ford._ Empty the basket, I say! _Mrs Ford._ Why, man, why? _Ford._ Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is: my 130 intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable. Pluck me out all the linen. _Mrs Ford._ If you find a man there, he shall die a flea\u2019s death. _Page._ Here\u2019s no man. 135 _Shal._ By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this wrongs you. _Evans._ Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies. _Ford._ Well, he\u2019s not here I seek for. 140 _Page._ No, nor nowhere else but in your brain. _Ford._ Help to search my house this one time. If I find not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of me, \u2018As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow walnut for his wife\u2019s 145 leman.\u2019 Satisfy me once more; once more search with me.", " I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe 55 were not, Nature thy friend.

You would have married her most shamefully, Where there was no proportion held in love. The truth is, she and I, long since contracted, 210 Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us. The offence is holy that she hath committed; And this deceit loses the name of craft, Of disobedience, or unduteous title; Since therein she doth evitate and shun 215 A thousand irreligious cursed hours, Which forced marriage would have brought upon her. _Ford._ Stand not amazed; here is no remedy: In love the heavens themselves do guide the state; Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate. 220 _Fal._ I am glad, though you have ta\u2019en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced. _Page._ Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy! What cannot be eschew\u2019d must be embraced. 225 _Fal._ When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased. _Mrs Page._ Well, I will muse no further.

Good Master Fenton, I will not be your friend nor enemy: My daughter will I question how she loves you, And as I find her, so am I affected. 90 Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in; Her father will be angry. _Fent._ Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

She calls you, coz: I\u2019ll leave you. _Anne._ Now, Master Slender,-- _Slen._ Now, good Mistress Anne,-- _Anne._ What is your will? 55 _Slen._ My will! od\u2019s heartlings, that\u2019s a pretty jest indeed! I ne\u2019er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise. _Anne._ I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me? 60 _Slen._ Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath made motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They can tell you how things go better than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes. 65 _Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE._ _Page._ Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.-- Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here? You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house: I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of. _Fent._ Nay, Master Page, be not impatient. 70 _Mrs Page._ Good Master Fenton, come not to my child. _Page._ She is no match for you. _Fent._ Sir, will you hear me? _Page._ No, good Master Fenton. Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in. Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.", " _Page._ Son, how now! how now, son! have you 170 dispatched? _Slen._ Dispatched!--I\u2019ll make the best in Gloucestershire know on\u2019t; would I were hanged, la, else! _Page._ Of what, son? _Slen._ I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne 175 Page, and she\u2019s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i\u2019 the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and \u2019tis a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Page._ Upon my life, then, you took the wrong. 180 _Slen._ What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman\u2019s apparel, I would not have had him. _Page._ Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments? 185 _Slen._ I went to her in white, and cried \u2018mum,\u2019 and she cried \u2018budget,\u2019 as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Mrs Page._ Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose; turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, 190 she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married. _Enter CAIUS._ _Caius._ Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha\u2019 married un gar\u00e7on, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened. 195 _Mrs Page._ Why, did you take her in green? _Caius._ Ay, by gar, and \u2019tis a boy: by gar, I\u2019ll raise all Windsor."], "Mistress Page and Mistress Ford can't decide whether they more enjoy fooling Falstaff or:": [" I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe 55 were not, Nature thy friend.

In my house I am sure he is: my 130 intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable. Pluck me out all the linen. _Mrs Ford._ If you find a man there, he shall die a flea\u2019s death. _Page._ Here\u2019s no man. 135 _Shal._ By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this wrongs you. _Evans._ Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies. _Ford._ Well, he\u2019s not here I seek for. 140 _Page._ No, nor nowhere else but in your brain. _Ford._ Help to search my house this one time. If I find not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of me, \u2018As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow walnut for his wife\u2019s 145 leman.\u2019 Satisfy me once more; once more search with me.", " I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe 55 were not, Nature thy friend.

I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in to me, her assistant, 235 or go-between, parted from me: I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth.

Up, gentlemen; you shall see sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.

[_Exeunt Page, Caius, and Evans._ _Mrs Page._ Is there not a double excellency in this? 155 _Mrs Ford._ I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir John. _Mrs Page._ What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket! _Mrs Ford._ I am half afraid he will have need of washing; 160 so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit. _Mrs Page._ Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the same distress. _Mrs Ford._ I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff\u2019s being here; for I never saw him so gross 165 in his jealousy till now. _Mrs Page._ I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine. _Mrs Ford._ Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress 170 Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water; and give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment? _Mrs Page._ We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow, eight o\u2019clock, to have amends.", " Fie, fie! he\u2019ll never come. _Evans._ You say he has been thrown in the rivers, and 20 has been grievously peaten, as an old \u2019oman: methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have no desires. _Page._ So think I too. _Mrs Ford._ Devise but how you\u2019ll use him when he comes, 25 And let us two devise to bring him thither. _Mrs Page._ There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter, Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest, Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight, Walk round about an oak, with great ragg\u2019d horns; 30 And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle, And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain In a most hideous and dreadful manner: You have heard of such a spirit; and well you know The superstitious idle-headed eld 35 Receiv\u2019d, and did deliver to our age, This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth. _Page._ Why, yet there want not many that do fear In deep of night to walk by this Herne\u2019s oak: But what of this? _Mrs Ford._ Marry, this is our device; 40 That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us. _Page._ Well, let it not be doubted but he\u2019ll come: And in this shape when you have brought him thither, What shall be done with him? what is your plot? _Mrs Page._ That likewise have we thought upon, and thus: 45 Nan Page my daughter and my little son And three or four more of their growth we\u2019ll dress Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white, With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads, And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden, 50 As Falstaff, she, and I, are newly met, Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once With some diffused song: upon their sight, We two in great amazedness will fly: Then let them all encircle him about, 55 And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight; And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel, In their so sacred paths he dares to tread In shape profane.", " And Falstaff\u2019s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid; and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming Mistress Page, divulge 35 Page himself for a secure and wilful Act\u00e6on; and to these violent proceedings all my neighbours shall cry aim. [_Clock heard._] The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as positive as the 40 earth is firm that Falstaff is there: I will go. _Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, HOST, SIR HUGH EVANS, CAIUS, and RUGBY._ _Shal., Page, &c._ Well met, Master Ford. _Ford._ Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home; and I pray you all go with me. _Shal._ I must excuse myself, Master Ford. 45 _Slen._ And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for more money than I\u2019ll speak of. _Shal._ We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have 50 our answer. _Slen._ I hope I have your good will, father Page. _Page._ You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:--but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether. _Caius._ Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my 55 nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush. _Host._ What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will carry\u2019t, he will carry\u2019t; \u2019tis in his buttons; he will carry\u2019t.", " _Ay, sir, tike,_ Collier.

Hark, good mine host. To-night at Herne\u2019s oak, just \u2019twixt twelve and one, Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen; 20 The purpose why, is here: in which disguise, While other jests are something rank on foot, Her father hath commanded her to slip Away with Slender, and with him at Eton Immediately to marry: she hath consented: 25 Now, sir, Her mother, even strong against that match, And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed That he shall likewise shuffle her away, While other sports are tasking of their minds, And at the deanery, where a priest attends, Straight marry her: to this her mother\u2019s plot She seemingly obedient likewise hath Made promise to the doctor."], "Who marries Anne Page?": [" _Page._ Son, how now! how now, son! have you 170 dispatched? _Slen._ Dispatched!--I\u2019ll make the best in Gloucestershire know on\u2019t; would I were hanged, la, else! _Page._ Of what, son? _Slen._ I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne 175 Page, and she\u2019s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i\u2019 the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and \u2019tis a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Page._ Upon my life, then, you took the wrong. 180 _Slen._ What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman\u2019s apparel, I would not have had him. _Page._ Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments? 185 _Slen._ I went to her in white, and cried \u2018mum,\u2019 and she cried \u2018budget,\u2019 as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Mrs Page._ Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose; turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, 190 she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married. _Enter CAIUS._ _Caius._ Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha\u2019 married un gar\u00e7on, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened. 195 _Mrs Page._ Why, did you take her in green? _Caius._ Ay, by gar, and \u2019tis a boy: by gar, I\u2019ll raise all Windsor.", " _Caius._ Sir Hugh send-a you?

THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR. Besides the copies of the _Merry Wives of Windsor_ appearing in the folios and modern editions, a quarto, Q3, has been collated in these Notes, of which the following is the title: The | Merry Wives | of Windsor.", " In the Edition annotated by Fanner, mentioned in note V., we find another conjecture of his: \u2018Ay, sir, if you like,\u2019 ... or it may have been \u2018Ay, sir, an you like,\u2019 for the word preceding \u2018you\u2019 has been cut away by the binder. NOTE X. The stage direction of the early Quartos is: _Enter Sir Hugh like a Satyre, and boyes drest like Fayries, Mistresse Quickly, like the Queene of Fayries; they sing a song about him and afterward speake._ The Folio enumerates at the commencement of the scene all who take part in it, including _Anne Page_, _Fairies_, _Quickly_ and _Pistol_, and in this place has merely _Enter Fairies_. Malone introduced _Anne Page as the Fairy Queen_, and at the end, _with waxen tapers on their heads_. He however still assigned the speeches 35-39, 53-74, 82-85, and 88-90 to _Quickly_. Recent Editors have generally given them to _Anne_, on the ground that it is proved by IV. 6. 20 and V. 3. 11, 12, that she was to \u2018present the Fairy Queen,\u2019 and that the character of the speeches is unsuitable to Mrs Quickly. It has been argued, too, that the _Qui._ of the folios, line 35, may be a misprint for _Qu._, i.e. _Queen_. This however is contradicted by the fact that Mrs Quickly plays the Queen in the early Quartos, and that the recurrence of _Qui._, line 88, proves that the printer of the first Folio used either _Qui._ or _Qu._ indifferently as the abbreviation of _Quickly_.", " And Falstaff\u2019s boy with her!

Creep into the kiln-hole. _Fal._ Where is it? _Mrs Ford._ He will seek there, on my word.

Q1 and Q2 are editions of an early sketch of the same play. The variations between the text of these quartos and the received text are so great that collation cannot be attempted. The text printed at the end of the play is taken _literatim_ from Q1, the edition of 1602, of which a copy is preserved among Capell\u2019s SHAKESPEARIANA, and this text is collated _verbatim_ with Q2, the second quarto printed in 1619. Q1 was reprinted in 1842 for the Shakespeare Society by Mr J. O. Halliwell. This text, which differs in one or two places from Capell\u2019s Q1, has also been collated. Q2 is given among TWENTY OF THE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE, edited by Steevens.

Good Master Fenton, I will not be your friend nor enemy: My daughter will I question how she loves you, And as I find her, so am I affected. 90 Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in; Her father will be angry. _Fent._ Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

[_Exit Fenton._] A kind heart he hath: a woman would run 100 through fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her: I will do what I can for them all three; for so I have promised, and I\u2019ll be as good as my word; 105 but speciously for Master Fenton.", " _Page._ Son, how now! how now, son! have you 170 dispatched? _Slen._ Dispatched!--I\u2019ll make the best in Gloucestershire know on\u2019t; would I were hanged, la, else! _Page._ Of what, son? _Slen._ I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne 175 Page, and she\u2019s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i\u2019 the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and \u2019tis a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Page._ Upon my life, then, you took the wrong. 180 _Slen._ What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman\u2019s apparel, I would not have had him. _Page._ Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments? 185 _Slen._ I went to her in white, and cried \u2018mum,\u2019 and she cried \u2018budget,\u2019 as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Mrs Page._ Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose; turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, 190 she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married. _Enter CAIUS._ _Caius._ Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha\u2019 married un gar\u00e7on, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened. 195 _Mrs Page._ Why, did you take her in green? _Caius._ Ay, by gar, and \u2019tis a boy: by gar, I\u2019ll raise all Windsor.", " Pa._ No sir _Iohn_ but boyes. _Fal._ By the Lord I was twice or thrise in the mind 90 They were not, and yet the grosnesse Of the fopperie perswaded me they were.

Whither go you? _Mrs Page._ Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home? _Ford._ Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for 10 want of company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two would marry. _Mrs Page._ Be sure of that,--two other husbands. _Ford._ Where had you this pretty weathercock? _Mrs Page._ I cannot tell what the dickens his name is 15 husband had him of. --What do you call your knight\u2019s name, sirrah? _Rob._ Sir John Falstaff. _Ford._ Sir John Falstaff! _Mrs Page._ He, he; I can never hit on\u2019s name. There 20 is such a league between my good man and he!--Is your wife at home indeed? _Ford._ Indeed she is. _Mrs Page._ By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her. [_Exeunt Mrs Page and Robin._ _Ford._ Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath 25 he any thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out his wife\u2019s inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she\u2019s going to my wife, and Falstaff\u2019s boy 30 with her.

NOTE IV. I. 3. 95. Perhaps, as in the _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, III. 1. 315, and other passages, some of which are mentioned by Sidney Walker in his \u2018Criticisms,\u2019 Vol. II. p. 13 sqq., this vexed passage may be emended by supplying a word. We venture to suggest \u2019the revolt of mine _anger_ is dangerous.\u2019 The recurrence of the same letters +anger+ in the word \u2018dangerous,\u2019 might mislead the printer\u2019s eye and cause the omission. NOTE V. II. 1. 5. In the copy of Johnson\u2019s Edition, which belongs to Emmanuel College, there is a MS. note of Dr Farmer\u2019s referring to Sonnet CXLVII. in support of the conjecture \u2018physician\u2019 for \u2018precisian;\u2019 we find there \u2018My reason, the physician to my love,\u2019 &c.

That the former was the original name is proved by the jest in II. 2. 136, where the Folios make sheer nonsense. Mr Halliwell suggests that the following lines, IV. 4. 75, 76, \u2019Nay I\u2019ll to him again in name of Broome; He\u2019ll tell me all his purpose: sure he\u2019ll come,\u2019 were intended to rhyme and therefore favour the later reading. But in this scene there are no rhyming lines except the couplet at the end. On the whole, it seems likely that the name was altered in the stage copies at the instance of some person of the name of Brook living at Windsor, who had sufficient acquaintance with the players, or interest with their patrons, to get it done.", " | As it hath been diuers times Acted by the right Honorable | my Lord Chamberlaines seruants.

NOTE X. The stage direction of the early Quartos is: _Enter Sir Hugh like a Satyre, and boyes drest like Fayries, Mistresse Quickly, like the Queene of Fayries; they sing a song about him and afterward speake._ The Folio enumerates at the commencement of the scene all who take part in it, including _Anne Page_, _Fairies_, _Quickly_ and _Pistol_, and in this place has merely _Enter Fairies_. Malone introduced _Anne Page as the Fairy Queen_, and at the end, _with waxen tapers on their heads_. He however still assigned the speeches 35-39, 53-74, 82-85, and 88-90 to _Quickly_. Recent Editors have generally given them to _Anne_, on the ground that it is proved by IV. 6. 20 and V. 3. 11, 12, that she was to \u2018present the Fairy Queen,\u2019 and that the character of the speeches is unsuitable to Mrs Quickly. It has been argued, too, that the _Qui._ of the folios, line 35, may be a misprint for _Qu._, i.e. _Queen_. This however is contradicted by the fact that Mrs Quickly plays the Queen in the early Quartos, and that the recurrence of _Qui._, line 88, proves that the printer of the first Folio used either _Qui._ or _Qu._ indifferently as the abbreviation of _Quickly_.", " Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter? 25 Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome! [_Noise within._ _Mrs Page._ Alas, what noise? _Mrs Ford._ Heaven forgive our sins! _Fal._ What should this be? 30 _Mrs Ford._} Away, away! [_They run off._ _Mrs Page._} _Fal._ I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the oil that\u2019s in me should set hell on fire; he would never else cross me thus. _Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before; PISTOL, as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and others, as Fairies, with tapers._ _Quick._ Fairies, black, grey, green, and white, 35 You moonshine revellers, and shades of night, You orphan heirs of fixed destiny, Attend your office and your quality. Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes. _Pist._ Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys. 40 Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap: Where fires thou find\u2019st unraked and hearths unswept, There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry: Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery. _Fal._ They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die: 45 I\u2019ll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.

Go you, and where you find a maid That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said, Raise up the organs of her fantasy; Sleep she as sound as careless infancy: 50 But those as sleep and think not on their sins, Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and shins.", " _Ay, sir, tike,_ Collier.

Hark, good mine host. To-night at Herne\u2019s oak, just \u2019twixt twelve and one, Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen; 20 The purpose why, is here: in which disguise, While other jests are something rank on foot, Her father hath commanded her to slip Away with Slender, and with him at Eton Immediately to marry: she hath consented: 25 Now, sir, Her mother, even strong against that match, And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed That he shall likewise shuffle her away, While other sports are tasking of their minds, And at the deanery, where a priest attends, Straight marry her: to this her mother\u2019s plot She seemingly obedient likewise hath Made promise to the doctor.", " Fie, fie! he\u2019ll never come. _Evans._ You say he has been thrown in the rivers, and 20 has been grievously peaten, as an old \u2019oman: methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have no desires. _Page._ So think I too. _Mrs Ford._ Devise but how you\u2019ll use him when he comes, 25 And let us two devise to bring him thither. _Mrs Page._ There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter, Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest, Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight, Walk round about an oak, with great ragg\u2019d horns; 30 And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle, And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain In a most hideous and dreadful manner: You have heard of such a spirit; and well you know The superstitious idle-headed eld 35 Receiv\u2019d, and did deliver to our age, This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth. _Page._ Why, yet there want not many that do fear In deep of night to walk by this Herne\u2019s oak: But what of this? _Mrs Ford._ Marry, this is our device; 40 That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us. _Page._ Well, let it not be doubted but he\u2019ll come: And in this shape when you have brought him thither, What shall be done with him? what is your plot? _Mrs Page._ That likewise have we thought upon, and thus: 45 Nan Page my daughter and my little son And three or four more of their growth we\u2019ll dress Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white, With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads, And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden, 50 As Falstaff, she, and I, are newly met, Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once With some diffused song: upon their sight, We two in great amazedness will fly: Then let them all encircle him about, 55 And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight; And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel, In their so sacred paths he dares to tread In shape profane."], "Who hope to ruin Falstaff?": [" I\u2019ll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury. _Mrs Ford._ \u2018Boarding,\u2019 call you it? I\u2019ll be sure to keep 80 him above deck. _Mrs Page._ So will I: if he come under my hatches, I\u2019ll never to sea again. Let\u2019s be revenged on him: let\u2019s appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath 85 pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter. _Mrs Ford._ Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him, that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O, that my husband saw this letter! it would give eternal food to his jealousy. 90 _Mrs Page._ Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he\u2019s as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause; and that, I hope, is an unmeasurable distance. _Mrs Ford._ You are the happier woman. 95 _Mrs Page._ Let\u2019s consult together against this greasy knight. Come hither.

I would all of the same strain were in the same distress. _Mrs Ford._ I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff\u2019s being here; for I never saw him so gross 165 in his jealousy till now. _Mrs Page._ I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine. _Mrs Ford._ Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress 170 Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water; and give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment? _Mrs Page._ We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow, eight o\u2019clock, to have amends.", " Whether had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master\u2019s heels? _Rob._ I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf. 5 _Mrs Page._ O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you\u2019ll be a courtier. _Enter FORD._ _Ford._ Well met, Mistress Page.

Master Brook, Falstaff\u2019s a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford\u2019s but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty 110 pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for it, Master Brook."], "What quality describes Page?": [" Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter? 25 Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome! [_Noise within._ _Mrs Page._ Alas, what noise? _Mrs Ford._ Heaven forgive our sins! _Fal._ What should this be? 30 _Mrs Ford._} Away, away!

But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed, I am sure, I have received none; unless experience be a jewel that I have 185 purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this: \u2018Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues; Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.\u2019 _Fal._ Have you received no promise of satisfaction at 190 her hands? _Ford._ Never. _Fal._ Have you importuned her to such a purpose? _Ford._ Never. _Fal._ Of what quality was your love, then?", " Whether had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master\u2019s heels? _Rob._ I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf. 5 _Mrs Page._ O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you\u2019ll be a courtier. _Enter FORD._ _Ford._ Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you? _Mrs Page._ Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home? _Ford._ Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for 10 want of company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two would marry. _Mrs Page._ Be sure of that,--two other husbands. _Ford._ Where had you this pretty weathercock? _Mrs Page._ I cannot tell what the dickens his name is 15 husband had him of. --What do you call your knight\u2019s name, sirrah? _Rob._ Sir John Falstaff. _Ford._ Sir John Falstaff! _Mrs Page._ He, he; I can never hit on\u2019s name. There 20 is such a league between my good man and he!--Is your wife at home indeed? _Ford._ Indeed she is. _Mrs Page._ By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her. [_Exeunt Mrs Page and Robin._ _Ford._ Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath 25 he any thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score.

Mr Staunton is unquestionably right in supposing that one part of Evans\u2019s speech is spoken aside to his opponent, and the other part aloud. It is impossible else to account for the sudden change of tone. It might have been conjectured that, being a parson, he wished to appear peacefully minded, and therefore made his offers of reconciliation aloud and his menaces in an under tone, but Caius\u2019s reply shews that it was the threat which had been made aloud. Evans\u2019s valour, it would seem, had already evaporated when he had \u2018a great dispositions to cry\u2019 (III. 1. 20) and, besides, he had just begun to see that he was being made a laughing-stock. As his former speech (74, 75,) is also conciliatory, it was probably spoken so as to be heard by Caius only. He wished to keep up his credit for courage in the eyes of the bystanders. In the corresponding scene of the first Quartos we have the words \u2018Hark van urd in your ear,\u2019 and the meaning of the text may have been obscured by some omission in the Folio. NOTE VIII. IV. 4. 41. No doubt there is an omission here in the Folio, which may be partly supplied from the Quarto. But it is probable that Mrs Ford gave a still fuller explanation of her device and the grounds on which the disguise was recommended to Falstaff, otherwise Page would not have been so confident of his falling into the snare. NOTE IX. IV. 5. 49. In the edition of 1778 Steevens reads \u2018Ay, sir Tike, like\u2019 ... but it is clear from Farmer\u2019s note that it should be \u2018Ay, sir Tike,\u2019 ... and so it is corrected in the later Editions of Steevens.", " Let me speak with the gentlemen: 5 they speak English? _Bard._ Ay, sir; I\u2019ll call them to you. _Host._ They shall have my horses; but I\u2019ll make them pay; I\u2019ll sauce them: they have had my house a week at command; I have turned away my other guests: they must 10 come off; I\u2019ll sauce them.

Henceforth do what thou wilt; I rather will suspect the sun with cold Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand, In him that was of late an heretic, As firm as faith. _Page._ \u2019Tis well, \u2019tis well; no more: 10 Be not as extreme in submission As in offence. But let our plot go forward: let our wives Yet once again, to make us public sport, Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow, 15 Where we may take him, and disgrace him for it. _Ford._ There is no better way than that they spoke of. _Page._ How? to send him word they\u2019ll meet him in the Park at midnight?", " And Falstaff\u2019s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid; and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming Mistress Page, divulge 35 Page himself for a secure and wilful Act\u00e6on; and to these violent proceedings all my neighbours shall cry aim. [_Clock heard._] The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as positive as the 40 earth is firm that Falstaff is there: I will go. _Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, HOST, SIR HUGH EVANS, CAIUS, and RUGBY._ _Shal., Page, &c._ Well met, Master Ford. _Ford._ Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home; and I pray you all go with me. _Shal._ I must excuse myself, Master Ford. 45 _Slen._ And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for more money than I\u2019ll speak of. _Shal._ We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have 50 our answer. _Slen._ I hope I have your good will, father Page. _Page._ You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:--but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether. _Caius._ Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my 55 nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush. _Host._ What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will carry\u2019t, he will carry\u2019t; \u2019tis in his buttons; he will carry\u2019t.", " _Mrs Ford._ And till he tell the truth, Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound, 60 And burn him with their tapers. _Mrs Page._ The truth being known, We\u2019ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit, And mock him home to Windsor. _Ford._ The children must Be practised well to this, or they\u2019ll ne\u2019er do\u2019t. _Evans._ I will teach the children their behaviours; and 65 I will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my taber. _Ford._ That will be excellent. I\u2019ll go and buy them vizards. _Mrs Page._ My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies, 70 Finely attired in a robe of white. _Page._ That silk will I go buy. [_Aside_] And in that time Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away, And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight. _Ford._ Nay, I\u2019ll to him again in name of Brook: 75 He\u2019ll tell me all his purpose: sure, he\u2019ll come. _Mrs Page._ Fear not you that. Go get us properties And tricking for our fairies. _Evans._ Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries. [_Exeunt Page, Ford, and Evans._ 80 _Mrs Page._ Go, Mistress Ford, Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind. [_Exit Mrs Ford._ I\u2019ll to the doctor: he hath my good will, And none but he, to marry with Nan Page. That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot; 85 And he my husband best of all affects. The doctor is well money\u2019d, and his friends Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her, Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her."], "Who does Anne marry in the end?": [" _Shal._ Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid? _Slen._ I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease 225 it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another; I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt: but if you say, \u2018Marry her,\u2019 I will marry her; that I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely. _Evans._ It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in 230 the ort \u2018dissolutely:\u2019 the ort is, according to our meaning, \u2018resolutely:\u2019 his meaning is good. _Shal._ Ay, I think my cousin meant well. _Slen._ Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la! _Shal._ Here comes fair Mistress Anne. 235 _Re-enter ANNE PAGE._ Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne! _Anne._ The dinner is on the table; my father desires your worships\u2019 company. _Shal._ I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne. _Evans._ Od\u2019s plessed will! I will not be absence at the 240 grace. [_Exeunt Shallow and Evans._ _Anne._ Will\u2019t please your worship to come in, sir? _Slen._ No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well. _Anne._ The dinner attends you, sir. 245 _Slen._ I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go, sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow.

Do you understand me? 190 _Slen._ Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so, I shall do that that is reason. _Shal._ Nay, but understand me. _Slen._ So I do, sir. _Evans._ Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will 195 description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it. _Slen._ Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray you, pardon me; he\u2019s a justice of peace in his country, simple though I stand here. _Evans._ But that is not the question: the question is 200 concerning your marriage. _Shal._ Ay, there\u2019s the point, sir. _Evans._ Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page. _Slen._ Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable 205 demands. _Evans._ But can you affection the \u2019oman? Let us command to know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your good will to the 210 maid? _Shal._ Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her? _Slen._ I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason. _Evans._ Nay, Got\u2019s lords and his ladies! you must 215 speak possitable, if you can carry her your desires towards her. _Shal._ That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her? _Slen._ I will do a greater thing than that, upon your 220 request, cousin, in any reason.", " _Page._ Son, how now! how now, son! have you 170 dispatched? _Slen._ Dispatched!--I\u2019ll make the best in Gloucestershire know on\u2019t; would I were hanged, la, else! _Page._ Of what, son? _Slen._ I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne 175 Page, and she\u2019s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i\u2019 the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and \u2019tis a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Page._ Upon my life, then, you took the wrong. 180 _Slen._ What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman\u2019s apparel, I would not have had him. _Page._ Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments? 185 _Slen._ I went to her in white, and cried \u2018mum,\u2019 and she cried \u2018budget,\u2019 as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Mrs Page._ Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose; turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, 190 she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married. _Enter CAIUS._ _Caius._ Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha\u2019 married un gar\u00e7on, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened. 195 _Mrs Page._ Why, did you take her in green? _Caius._ Ay, by gar, and \u2019tis a boy: by gar, I\u2019ll raise all Windsor.", " 30 _Shal._ The council shall hear it; it is a riot. _Evans._ It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a riot; take your vizaments in that. 35 _Shal._ Ha! o\u2019 my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it. _Evans._ It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it: and there is also another device in my prain, which peradventure prings goot discretions with it:--there is Anne 40 Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas Page, which is pretty virginity. _Slen._ Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman. _Evans._ It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as 45 you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his death\u2019s-bed (Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!) give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles and prabbles, and desire a marriage between 50 Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page. _Slen._ Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound? _Evans._ Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny. _Slen._ I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts. 55 _Evans._ Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts. _Shal._ Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there? _Evans._ Shall I tell you a lie?

I will peat the door for Master Page. [_Knocks_] What, hoa!

I thank 70 you for my venison, Master Shallow. _Shal._ Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it your good heart! I wished your venison better; it was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?--and I thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart. 75 _Page._ Sir, I thank you. _Shal._ Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do. _Page._ I am glad to see you, good Master Slender. _Slen._ How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he was outrun on Cotsall. 80 _Page._ It could not be judged, sir. _Slen._ You\u2019ll not confess, you\u2019ll not confess. _Shal._ That he will not. \u2019Tis your fault, \u2019tis your fault; \u2019tis a good dog. _Page._ A cur, sir. 85 _Shal._ Sir, he\u2019s a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here? _Page._ Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office between you. _Evans._ It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak. 90 _Shal._ He hath wronged me, Master Page. _Page._ Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.", " _Shal._ He will maintain you like a gentlewoman. 45 _Slen._ Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the degree of a squire. _Shal._ He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure. _Anne._ Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself. 50 _Shal._ Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good comfort. She calls you, coz: I\u2019ll leave you. _Anne._ Now, Master Slender,-- _Slen._ Now, good Mistress Anne,-- _Anne._ What is your will? 55 _Slen._ My will! od\u2019s heartlings, that\u2019s a pretty jest indeed! I ne\u2019er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise. _Anne._ I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me? 60 _Slen._ Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath made motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They can tell you how things go better than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes. 65 _Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE._ _Page._ Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.-- Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here? You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house: I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of. _Fent._ Nay, Master Page, be not impatient. 70 _Mrs Page._ Good Master Fenton, come not to my child. _Page._ She is no match for you. _Fent._ Sir, will you hear me? _Page._ No, good Master Fenton. Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in. Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.", " _Fal._ Well, Mistress Ford;--what of her? 50 _Quick._ Why, sir, she\u2019s a good creature. --Lord, Lord! your worship\u2019s a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all of us, I pray! _Fal._ Mistress Ford;--come, Mistress Ford,-- _Quick._ Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you 55 have brought her into such a canaries as \u2019tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her to such a canary.

I do not think the knight 155 would offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men; very rogues, now they be out of service. _Ford._ Were they his men? _Page._ Marry, were they. 160 _Ford._ I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter? _Page._ Ay, marry, does he.

Your father and my uncle hath made motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They can tell you how things go better than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes. 65 _Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE._ _Page._ Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.-- Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here? You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house: I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of. _Fent._ Nay, Master Page, be not impatient. 70 _Mrs Page._ Good Master Fenton, come not to my child. _Page._ She is no match for you. _Fent._ Sir, will you hear me? _Page._ No, good Master Fenton.

[_Aside_] This is my father\u2019s choice. O, what a world of vile ill-favour\u2019d faults Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year! _Quick._ And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you. 35 _Shal._ She\u2019s coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father! _Slen._ I had a father, Mistress Anne;--my uncle can tell you good jests of him.

I have had ford enough; I was thrown into the ford; I have my belly full of ford. _Quick._ Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault: she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection. 35 _Fal._ So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman\u2019s promise. _Quick._ Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her 40 between eight and nine: I must carry her word quickly: she\u2019ll make you amends, I warrant you. _Fal._ Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her think what a man is: let her consider his frailty, and then judge of my merit.", " _Bard._ And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; 160 and so conclusions passed the careires. _Slen._ Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but \u2019tis no matter: I\u2019ll ne\u2019er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick: if I be drunk, I\u2019ll be drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not 165 with drunken knaves. _Evans._ So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind. _Fal._ You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it. _Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE, following._ _Page._ Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we\u2019ll drink 170 within.

[_Aside to her_] Speak louder. _Mrs Page._ Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here. 15 _Mrs Ford._ Why? _Mrs Page._ Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again: he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails against all married mankind; so curses all Eve\u2019s daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets himself 20 on the forehead, crying, \u2018Peer out, peer out!\u2019 that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience, to this his distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.", " I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe 55 were not, Nature thy friend.

I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her own appointment; even as you came in to me, her assistant, 235 or go-between, parted from me: I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall know how I speed. _Ford._. I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know 240 Ford, sir? _Fal._ Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave!

I will use her as the key of the 245 cuckoldly rogue\u2019s coffer; and there\u2019s my harvest-home. _Ford._ I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him, if you saw him. _Fal._ Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue!

In my house I am sure he is: my 130 intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable. Pluck me out all the linen. _Mrs Ford._ If you find a man there, he shall die a flea\u2019s death. _Page._ Here\u2019s no man. 135 _Shal._ By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this wrongs you. _Evans._ Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies. _Ford._ Well, he\u2019s not here I seek for. 140 _Page._ No, nor nowhere else but in your brain. _Ford._ Help to search my house this one time.

If it had not been i\u2019 the church, I would have swinged him, or he should have swinged me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and \u2019tis a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Page._ Upon my life, then, you took the wrong. 180 _Slen._ What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman\u2019s apparel, I would not have had him. _Page._ Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments? 185 _Slen._ I went to her in white, and cried \u2018mum,\u2019 and she cried \u2018budget,\u2019 as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster\u2019s boy. _Mrs Page._ Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose; turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, 190 she is now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married. _Enter CAIUS._ _Caius._ Vere is Mistress Page?

I would not ha\u2019 your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor Castle. _Ford._ \u2019Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it. _Evans._ You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is 195 as honest a \u2019omans as I will desires among five thousand, and five hundred too. _Caius._ By gar, I see \u2019tis an honest woman. _Ford._ Well, I promised you a dinner. --Come, come, walk in the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter 200 make known to you why I have done this. --Come, wife; come, Mistress Page. --I pray you, pardon me; pray heartily pardon me. _Page._ Let\u2019s go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we\u2019ll mock him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my 205 house to breakfast: after, we\u2019ll a-birding together; I have a fine hawk for the bush.", " _Re-enter MISTRESS FORD._ Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford, the honest woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that hath the jealous fool to her husband!

[_Pulling clothes out of the basket._ 120 _Page._ This passes! _Mrs Ford._ Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone. _Ford._ I shall find you anon. _Evans._ \u2019Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife\u2019s clothes? Come away. 125 _Ford._ Empty the basket, I say! _Mrs Ford._ Why, man, why? _Ford._ Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is: my 130 intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable. Pluck me out all the linen. _Mrs Ford._ If you find a man there, he shall die a flea\u2019s death. _Page._ Here\u2019s no man. 135 _Shal._ By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this wrongs you. _Evans._ Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies. _Ford._ Well, he\u2019s not here I seek for. 140 _Page._ No, nor nowhere else but in your brain. _Ford._ Help to search my house this one time. If I find not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of me, \u2018As jealous as Ford, that searched a hollow walnut for his wife\u2019s 145 leman.\u2019 Satisfy me once more; once more search with me.", " _Fal._ Ten and eleven. _Quick._ Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford, her 80 husband, will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him! he\u2019s a very jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with him, good heart. _Fal._ Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will not fail her. 85 _Quick._ Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you, too: and let me tell you in your ear, she\u2019s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as 90 any is in Windsor, whoe\u2019er be the other: and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home; but, she hopes, there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man: surely, I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth. 95 _Fal._ Not I, I assure thee: setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms. _Quick._ Blessing on your heart for\u2019t! _Fal._ But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford\u2019s wife and Page\u2019s wife acquainted each other how they love me? 100 _Quick._ That were a jest indeed! they have not so little grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves: her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page; and, truly, Master Page is an honest man."], "Mistresses Ford and Page ask their servants to be ready with ___ for Falstaff\u2019s arrival.": [" _destiny_ Anon. conj. 63: _Poins_] _Poyntz_ F1 Q3 F2. _Poinz_ F3 F4.

I see you are obsequious in your love, and I profess requital to a hair\u2019s breadth; not only, Mistress Ford, in the simple office of love, but in all the accoutrement, complement, and ceremony of it. But are you sure 5 of your husband now? _Mrs Ford._ He\u2019s a-birding, sweet Sir John. _Mrs Page._ [_Within_] What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho! _Mrs Ford._ Step into the chamber, Sir John. [_Exit Falstaff._ _Enter MISTRESS PAGE._ _Mrs Page._ How now, sweetheart! who\u2019s at home besides 10 yourself? _Mrs Ford._ Why, none but mine own people. _Mrs Page._ Indeed! _Mrs Ford._ No, certainly. [_Aside to her_] Speak louder. _Mrs Page._ Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here. 15 _Mrs Ford._ Why? _Mrs Page._ Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again: he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails against all married mankind; so curses all Eve\u2019s daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets himself 20 on the forehead, crying, \u2018Peer out, peer out!\u2019 that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience, to this his distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.", " 85 _Mrs Ford._ I\u2019ll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket. Go up; I\u2019ll bring linen for him straight. [_Exit._ _Mrs Page._ Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough. We\u2019ll leave a proof, by that which we will do, 90 Wives may be merry, and yet honest too: We do not act that often jest and laugh; \u2019Tis old, but true,--Still swine eat all the draff. [_Exit._ _Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two SERVANTS._ _Mrs Ford._ Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders: your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it 95 down, obey him: quickly, dispatch. [_Exit._ _First Serv._ Come, come, take it up. _Sec. Serv._ Pray heaven it be not full of knight again. _First Serv._ I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead. _Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS._ _Ford._ Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you 100 any way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket, villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!--O you panderly rascals! there\u2019s a knot, a ging, a pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil be shamed. --What, wife, I say!--Come, come forth! Behold what honest 105 clothes you send forth to bleaching! _Page._ Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go loose any longer; you must be pinioned. _Evans._ Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog! 110 _Shal._ Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed. _Ford._ So say I too, sir."], "Mistress Page rushes in with news that her husband is coming with ___ to search for a gentleman.": [" _Mrs Page._ O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an 85 honest man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion! _Mrs Ford._ What cause of suspicion? _Mrs Page._ What cause of suspicion! Out upon you! how am I mistook in you! 90 _Mrs Ford._ Why, alas, what\u2019s the matter? _Mrs Page._ Your husband\u2019s coming hither, woman, with all the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house, by your consent, to take an ill advantage of his absence: you are undone. 95 _Mrs Ford._ \u2019Tis not so, I hope. _Mrs Page._ Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man here! but \u2019tis most certain your husband\u2019s coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If you know yourself clear, 100 why, I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here, convey, convey him out. Be not amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever. _Mrs Ford._ What shall I do? There is a gentleman 105 my dear friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the house. _Mrs Page._ For shame! never stand \u2018you had rather\u2019 and \u2018you had rather:\u2019 your husband\u2019s here at hand; bethink 110 you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking: or,--it is whiting-time,--send him by your two 115 men to Datchet-mead.", " Let me stop this way first. [_Locking the door._] So, now uncape. 145 _Page._ Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much. _Ford._ True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen; you shall see sport anon: follow me, gentlemen. [_Exit._ _Evans._ This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies. 150 _Caius._ By gar, \u2019tis no the fashion of France; it is not jealous in France. _Page._ Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search. [_Exeunt Page, Caius, and Evans._ _Mrs Page._ Is there not a double excellency in this? 155 _Mrs Ford._ I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceived, or Sir John. _Mrs Page._ What a taking was he in when your husband asked who was in the basket! _Mrs Ford._ I am half afraid he will have need of washing; 160 so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit. _Mrs Page._ Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the same distress. _Mrs Ford._ I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff\u2019s being here; for I never saw him so gross 165 in his jealousy till now. _Mrs Page._ I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine. _Mrs Ford._ Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress 170 Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water; and give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment? _Mrs Page._ We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow, eight o\u2019clock, to have amends.", " _destiny_ Anon. conj. 63: _Poins_] _Poyntz_ F1 Q3 F2. _Poinz_ F3 F4.

Unless you go out disguised,-- _Mrs Ford._ How might we disguise him? _Mrs Page._ Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman\u2019s gown big enough for him; otherwise he might put on a hat, a muffler, and a kerchief, and so escape. 60 _Fal._ Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather than a mischief. _Mrs Ford._ My maid\u2019s aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a gown above. _Mrs Page._ On my word, it will serve him; she\u2019s as big 65 as he is: and there\u2019s her thrummed hat, and her muffler too.

You would have married her most shamefully, Where there was no proportion held in love. The truth is, she and I, long since contracted, 210 Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us. The offence is holy that she hath committed; And this deceit loses the name of craft, Of disobedience, or unduteous title; Since therein she doth evitate and shun 215 A thousand irreligious cursed hours, Which forced marriage would have brought upon her. _Ford._ Stand not amazed; here is no remedy: In love the heavens themselves do guide the state; Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate. 220 _Fal._ I am glad, though you have ta\u2019en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced. _Page._ Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy! What cannot be eschew\u2019d must be embraced. 225 _Fal._ When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased. _Mrs Page._ Well, I will muse no further.

I ne\u2019er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise. _Anne._ I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me? 60 _Slen._ Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath made motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They can tell you how things go better than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes. 65 _Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE._ _Page._ Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.-- Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here? You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house: I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of. _Fent._ Nay, Master Page, be not impatient. 70 _Mrs Page._ Good Master Fenton, come not to my child. _Page._ She is no match for you. _Fent._ Sir, will you hear me? _Page._ No, good Master Fenton. Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in. Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.", " _Host._ Conceal them, or thou diest. 40 _Sim._ Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne Page; to know if it were my master\u2019s fortune to have her or no. _Fal._ \u2019Tis, \u2019tis his fortune. _Sim._ What, sir? 45 _Fal._ To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so. _Sim._ May I be bold to say so, sir? _Fal._ Ay, sir; like who more bold. _Sim._ I thank your worship: I shall make my master 50 glad with these tidings. [_Exit._ _Host._ Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was there a wise woman with thee? _Fal._ Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught me more wit than ever I learned before in my 55 life; and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for my learning. _Enter BARDOLPH._ _Bard._ Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage! _Host._ Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto. 60 _Bard._ Run away with the cozeners: for so soon as I came beyond Eton, they threw me off, from behind one of them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away, like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses. _Host._ They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do 65 not say they be fled; Germans are honest men. _Enter SIR HUGH EVANS._ _Evans._ Where is mine host? _Host._ What is the matter, sir? _Evans._ Have a care of your entertainments: there is a friend of mine come to town, tells me there is three 70 cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and money."], "Mistress Quickly thinks Fenton is ___.": [" 75 [_Exeunt Page, Shal., and Slen._ _Quick._ Speak to Mistress Page. _Fent._ Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter In such a righteous fashion as I do, Perforce, against all checks, rebukes and manners, I must advance the colours of my love, 80 And not retire: let me have your good will. _Anne._ Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool. _Mrs Page._ I mean it not; I seek you a better husband. _Quick._ That\u2019s my master, master doctor. _Anne._ Alas, I had rather be set quick i\u2019 the earth, 85 And bowl\u2019d to death with turnips! _Mrs Page._ Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton, I will not be your friend nor enemy: My daughter will I question how she loves you, And as I find her, so am I affected. 90 Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in; Her father will be angry. _Fent._ Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan. [_Exeunt Mrs Page and Anne._ _Quick._ This is my doing now: \u2018Nay,\u2019 said I, \u2018will you cast away your child on a fool, and a physician?

[_Exit Fenton._] A kind heart he hath: a woman would run 100 through fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her: I will do what I can for them all three; for so I have promised, and I\u2019ll be as good as my word; 105 but speciously for Master Fenton.", " [_Exit._ _Ford._ This is strange.

You would have married her most shamefully, Where there was no proportion held in love. The truth is, she and I, long since contracted, 210 Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us. The offence is holy that she hath committed; And this deceit loses the name of craft, Of disobedience, or unduteous title; Since therein she doth evitate and shun 215 A thousand irreligious cursed hours, Which forced marriage would have brought upon her. _Ford._ Stand not amazed; here is no remedy: In love the heavens themselves do guide the state; Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate. 220 _Fal._ I am glad, though you have ta\u2019en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced. _Page._ Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy! What cannot be eschew\u2019d must be embraced. 225 _Fal._ When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased. _Mrs Page._ Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton, Heaven give you many, many merry days!

[_Aside_] This is my father\u2019s choice. O, what a world of vile ill-favour\u2019d faults Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year! _Quick._ And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you. 35 _Shal._ She\u2019s coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father! _Slen._ I had a father, Mistress Anne;--my uncle can tell you good jests of him.

Well: on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master 95 Brook: I suffered the pangs of three several deaths; first, an intolerable fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in, like a strong distillation, with 100 stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.", " I see what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe 55 were not, Nature thy friend.

FALSTAFF pulls off his buck\u2019s head, and rises._ _Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD._ _Page._ Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch\u2019d you now: Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn? _Mrs Page._ I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher. Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives? See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes 105 Become the forest better than the town? _Ford._ Now, sir, who\u2019s a cuckold now? Master Brook, Falstaff\u2019s a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford\u2019s but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty 110 pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for it, Master Brook.", " 85 _Mrs Ford._ I\u2019ll first direct my men what they shall do with the basket. Go up; I\u2019ll bring linen for him straight. [_Exit._ _Mrs Page._ Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough. We\u2019ll leave a proof, by that which we will do, 90 Wives may be merry, and yet honest too: We do not act that often jest and laugh; \u2019Tis old, but true,--Still swine eat all the draff. [_Exit._ _Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two SERVANTS._ _Mrs Ford._ Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders: your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it 95 down, obey him: quickly, dispatch. [_Exit._ _First Serv._ Come, come, take it up. _Sec. Serv._ Pray heaven it be not full of knight again. _First Serv._ I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead. _Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS._ _Ford._ Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you 100 any way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket, villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!--O you panderly rascals! there\u2019s a knot, a ging, a pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil be shamed. --What, wife, I say!--Come, come forth! Behold what honest 105 clothes you send forth to bleaching! _Page._ Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go loose any longer; you must be pinioned. _Evans._ Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog! 110 _Shal._ Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed. _Ford._ So say I too, sir.", " Go bear thou this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive. _Pist._ Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become, And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all! 70 _Nym._ I will run no base humour: here, take the humour-letter: I will keep the haviour of reputation. _Fal._ [_To Robin_] Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly; Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores. Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go; 75 Trudge, plod away o\u2019 the hoof; seek shelter, pack! Falstaff will learn the humour of the age, French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page. [_Exeunt Falstaff and Robin._ _Pist._ Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds, And high and low beguiles the rich and poor: 80 Tester I\u2019ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack, Base Phrygian Turk! _Nym._ I have operations which be humours of revenge. _Pist._ Wilt thou revenge? _Nym._ By welkin and her star! 85 _Pist._ With wit or steel? _Nym._ With both the humours, I: I will discuss the humour of this love to Page. _Pist._ And I to Ford shall eke unfold How Falstaff, varlet vile, 90 His dove will prove, his gold will hold, And his soft couch defile. _Nym._ My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to deal with poison; I will possess him with yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous: that is my true humour. 95 _Pist._ Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.", " Whether had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master\u2019s heels? _Rob._ I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf. 5 _Mrs Page._ O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you\u2019ll be a courtier. _Enter FORD._ _Ford._ Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you? _Mrs Page._ Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home? _Ford._ Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for 10 want of company. I think, if your husbands were dead, you two would marry. _Mrs Page._ Be sure of that,--two other husbands. _Ford._ Where had you this pretty weathercock? _Mrs Page._ I cannot tell what the dickens his name is 15 husband had him of. --What do you call your knight\u2019s name, sirrah? _Rob._ Sir John Falstaff. _Ford._ Sir John Falstaff! _Mrs Page._ He, he; I can never hit on\u2019s name. There 20 is such a league between my good man and he!--Is your wife at home indeed? _Ford._ Indeed she is. _Mrs Page._ By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her. [_Exeunt Mrs Page and Robin._ _Ford._ Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath 25 he any thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out his wife\u2019s inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she\u2019s going to my wife, and Falstaff\u2019s boy 30 with her. A man may hear this shower sing in the wind."], "Evans tells Falstaff that the fairies won't bother him if he serves who or what?": [" _Mrs Ford._ Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet. I will never take you for my love again; but I will always count you my deer. 115 _Fal._ I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass. _Ford._ Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant. _Fal._ And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers, 120 drove the grossness of the foppery into a received belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when \u2019tis upon ill employment! _Evans._ Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your 125 desires, and fairies will not pinse you. _Ford._ Well said, fairy Hugh. _Evans._ And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you. _Ford._ I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her in good English. 130 _Fal._ Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross o\u2019erreaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I have a coxcomb of frize? Tis time I were choked with a piece of toasted cheese. 135 _Evans._ Seese is not good to give putter; your pelly is all putter. _Fal._ \u2018Seese\u2019 and \u2019putter\u2019! have I lived to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.", " _Mrs Ford._ And till he tell the truth, Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound, 60 And burn him with their tapers. _Mrs Page._ The truth being known, We\u2019ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit, And mock him home to Windsor. _Ford._ The children must Be practised well to this, or they\u2019ll ne\u2019er do\u2019t. _Evans._ I will teach the children their behaviours; and 65 I will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my taber. _Ford._ That will be excellent. I\u2019ll go and buy them vizards. _Mrs Page._ My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies, 70 Finely attired in a robe of white. _Page._ That silk will I go buy. [_Aside_] And in that time Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away, And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight. _Ford._ Nay, I\u2019ll to him again in name of Brook: 75 He\u2019ll tell me all his purpose: sure, he\u2019ll come. _Mrs Page._ Fear not you that. Go get us properties And tricking for our fairies. _Evans._ Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries. [_Exeunt Page, Ford, and Evans._ 80 _Mrs Page._ Go, Mistress Ford, Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind. [_Exit Mrs Ford._ I\u2019ll to the doctor: he hath my good will, And none but he, to marry with Nan Page. That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot; 85 And he my husband best of all affects. The doctor is well money\u2019d, and his friends Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her, Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.", " _Caius._ I know vat I have to do. Adieu. 5 _Mrs Page._ Fare you well, sir. [_Exit Caius._] My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor\u2019s marrying my daughter: but \u2019tis no matter; better a little chiding than a great deal of heart-break. 10 _Mrs Ford._ Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the Welsh devil Hugh? _Mrs Page._ They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne\u2019s oak, with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of Falstaff\u2019s and our meeting, they will at once 15 display to the night. _Mrs Ford._ That cannot choose but amaze him. _Mrs Page._ If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be amazed, he will every way be mocked. _Mrs Ford._ We\u2019ll betray him finely. 20 _Mrs Page._ Against such lewdsters and their lechery Those that betray them do no treachery. _Mrs Ford._ The hour draws on.

[_They burn him with their tapers._ _Fal._ Oh, Oh, Oh! _Quick._ Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire! About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme; And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time. 90 SONG. Fie on sinful fantasy! Fie on lust and luxury! Lust is but a bloody fire, Kindled with unchaste desire, Fed in heart, whose flames aspire, 95 As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher. Pinch him, fairies, mutually; Pinch him for his villany; Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about, Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out. 100 _During this song they pinch FALSTAFF.
