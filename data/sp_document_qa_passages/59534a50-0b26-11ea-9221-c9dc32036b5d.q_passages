{"Which characteris late for Katherine and Petruchio\u2019s wedding?": [" PETRUCHIO. Father, \u2019tis thus: yourself and all the world That talk\u2019d of her have talk\u2019d amiss of her: If she be curst, it is for policy, For she\u2019s not froward, but modest as the dove; She is not hot, but temperate as the morn; For patience she will prove a second Grissel, And Roman Lucrece for her chastity; And to conclude, we have \u2019greed so well together That upon Sunday is the wedding-day. KATHERINA. I\u2019ll see thee hang\u2019d on Sunday first. GREMIO. Hark, Petruchio; she says she\u2019ll see thee hang\u2019d first. TRANIO. Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part! PETRUCHIO. Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself; If she and I be pleas\u2019d, what\u2019s that to you? \u2019Tis bargain\u2019d \u2019twixt us twain, being alone, That she shall still be curst in company. I tell you, \u2019tis incredible to believe How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, That in a twink she won me to her love. O! you are novices: \u2019tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice, To buy apparel \u2019gainst the wedding-day. Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests; I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine. BAPTISTA. I know not what to say; but give me your hands. God send you joy, Petruchio! \u2019Tis a match. GREMIO, TRANIO. Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.", " [Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.] GREMIO. My cake is dough, but I\u2019ll in among the rest; Out of hope of all but my share of the feast. [Exit.] Petruchio and Katherina advance. KATHERINA. Husband, let\u2019s follow to see the end of this ado. PETRUCHIO. First kiss me, Kate, and we will. KATHERINA. What! in the midst of the street? PETRUCHIO. What! art thou ashamed of me? KATHERINA. No, sir; God forbid; but ashamed to kiss. PETRUCHIO. Why, then, let\u2019s home again. Come, sirrah, let\u2019s away. KATHERINA. Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay. PETRUCHIO. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate: Better once than never, for never too late. [Exeunt.] SCENE II. A room in LUCENTIO\u2019S house. Enter Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Pedant, Lucentio, Bianca, Petruchio, Katherina, Hortensio and Widow. Tranio, Biondello and Grumio and Others, attending. LUCENTIO. At last, though long, our jarring notes agree: And time it is when raging war is done, To smile at \u2019scapes and perils overblown. My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, While I with self-same kindness welcome thine. Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina, And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow, Feast with the best, and welcome to my house: My banquet is to close our stomachs up, After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down; For now we sit to chat as well as eat. [They sit at table.] PETRUCHIO. Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!", " KATHERINA. Go, fool, and whom thou keep\u2019st command. PETRUCHIO. Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait? O! be thou Dian, and let her be Kate, And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful! KATHERINA. Where did you study all this goodly speech? PETRUCHIO. It is extempore, from my mother-wit. KATHERINA. A witty mother! witless else her son. PETRUCHIO. Am I not wise? KATHERINA. Yes; keep you warm. PETRUCHIO. Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed; And therefore, setting all this chat aside, Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented That you shall be my wife your dowry \u2019greed on; And will you, nill you, I will marry you. Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn; For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,\u2014 Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,\u2014 Thou must be married to no man but me; For I am he am born to tame you, Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates. Re-enter Baptista, Gremio and Tranio. Here comes your father. Never make denial; I must and will have Katherine to my wife. BAPTISTA. Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter? PETRUCHIO. How but well, sir? how but well? It were impossible I should speed amiss. BAPTISTA. Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps? KATHERINA. Call you me daughter? Now I promise you You have show\u2019d a tender fatherly regard To wish me wed to one half lunatic, A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack, That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.", " PETRUCHIO. Why, what\u2019s a moveable? KATHERINA. A joint-stool. PETRUCHIO. Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me. KATHERINA. Asses are made to bear, and so are you. PETRUCHIO. Women are made to bear, and so are you. KATHERINA. No such jade as bear you, if me you mean. PETRUCHIO. Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee; For, knowing thee to be but young and light,\u2014 KATHERINA. Too light for such a swain as you to catch; And yet as heavy as my weight should be. PETRUCHIO. Should be! should buz! KATHERINA. Well ta\u2019en, and like a buzzard. PETRUCHIO. O, slow-wing\u2019d turtle! shall a buzzard take thee? KATHERINA. Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard. PETRUCHIO. Come, come, you wasp; i\u2019 faith, you are too angry. KATHERINA. If I be waspish, best beware my sting. PETRUCHIO. My remedy is then to pluck it out. KATHERINA. Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies. PETRUCHIO. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail. KATHERINA. In his tongue. PETRUCHIO. Whose tongue? KATHERINA. Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell. PETRUCHIO. What! with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again, Good Kate; I am a gentleman. KATHERINA. That I\u2019ll try. [Striking him.] PETRUCHIO. I swear I\u2019ll cuff you if you strike again. KATHERINA. So may you lose your arms: If you strike me, you are no gentleman; And if no gentleman, why then no arms. PETRUCHIO. A herald, Kate? O! put me in thy books. KATHERINA."], "Who becomes Bianca\u2019smusic teacher?": [" BAPTISTA. Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina! KATHERINA. What is your will sir, that you send for me? PETRUCHIO. Where is your sister, and Hortensio\u2019s wife? KATHERINA. They sit conferring by the parlour fire. PETRUCHIO. Go fetch them hither; if they deny to come, Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands. Away, I say, and bring them hither straight. [Exit Katherina.] LUCENTIO. Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder. HORTENSIO. And so it is. I wonder what it bodes. PETRUCHIO. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life, An awful rule, and right supremacy; And, to be short, what not that\u2019s sweet and happy. BAPTISTA. Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio! The wager thou hast won; and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns; Another dowry to another daughter, For she is chang\u2019d, as she had never been. PETRUCHIO. Nay, I will win my wager better yet, And show more sign of her obedience, Her new-built virtue and obedience. See where she comes, and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion. Re-enter Katherina with Bianca and Widow. Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not: Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot. [Katherina pulls off her cap and throws it down.] WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass! BIANCA. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this? LUCENTIO.

What, master, read you? First resolve me that. LUCENTIO. I read that I profess, The Art to Love. BIANCA. And may you prove, sir, master of your art! LUCENTIO.

I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful. HORTENSIO. Mistake no more; I am not Licio. Nor a musician as I seem to be; But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentleman And makes a god of such a cullion: Know, sir, that I am call\u2019d Hortensio. TRANIO.

Ne\u2019er ask me what raiment I\u2019ll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet: nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the over-leather.

Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all. PETRUCHIO. Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance, Let\u2019s each one send unto his wife, And he whose wife is most obedient, To come at first when he doth send for her, Shall win the wager which we will propose. HORTENSIO. Content. What\u2019s the wager?"], "How does Traniotrick the pedant?": [" GREMIO. I marvel Cambio comes not all this while. Enter Petruchio, Katherina, Vincentio and Attendants. PETRUCHIO. Sir, here\u2019s the door; this is Lucentio\u2019s house: My father\u2019s bears more toward the market-place; Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir. VINCENTIO. You shall not choose but drink before you go. I think I shall command your welcome here, And by all likelihood some cheer is toward. [Knocks.] GREMIO. They\u2019re busy within; you were best knock louder. Enter Pedant above, at a window. PEDANT. What\u2019s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate? VINCENTIO. Is Signior Lucentio within, sir? PEDANT. He\u2019s within, sir, but not to be spoken withal. VINCENTIO. What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make merry withal? PEDANT. Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall need none so long as I live. PETRUCHIO. Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him. PEDANT. Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking out at the window. VINCENTIO. Art thou his father? PEDANT. Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her. PETRUCHIO. [To Vincentio] Why, how now, gentleman! why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man\u2019s name. PEDANT. Lay hands on the villain: I believe a means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.", " TRANIO. What is he, Biondello? BIONDELLO. Master, a mercatante or a pedant, I know not what; but formal in apparel, In gait and countenance surely like a father. LUCENTIO. And what of him, Tranio? TRANIO. If he be credulous and trust my tale, I\u2019ll make him glad to seem Vincentio, And give assurance to Baptista Minola, As if he were the right Vincentio. Take in your love, and then let me alone. [Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.] Enter a Pedant. PEDANT. God save you, sir! TRANIO. And you, sir! you are welcome. Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest? PEDANT. Sir, at the farthest for a week or two; But then up farther, and as far as Rome; And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life. TRANIO. What countryman, I pray? PEDANT. Of Mantua. TRANIO. Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid, And come to Padua, careless of your life! PEDANT. My life, sir! How, I pray? for that goes hard. TRANIO. \u2019Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua. Know you not the cause? Your ships are stay\u2019d at Venice; and the Duke,\u2014 For private quarrel \u2019twixt your Duke and him,\u2014 Hath publish\u2019d and proclaim\u2019d it openly. \u2019Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come You might have heard it else proclaim\u2019d about. PEDANT. Alas, sir! it is worse for me than so; For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence, and must here deliver them. TRANIO. Well, sir, to do you courtesy, This will I do, and this I will advise you: First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?", " Padua. Before BAPTISTA\u2019S house. Enter Tranio and the Pedant dressed like Vincentio TRANIO. Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call? PEDANT. Ay, what else? and, but I be deceived, Signior Baptista may remember me, Near twenty years ago in Genoa, Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus. TRANIO. \u2019Tis well; and hold your own, in any case, With such austerity as \u2019longeth to a father. PEDANT. I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy; \u2019Twere good he were school\u2019d. Enter Biondello. TRANIO. Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello, Now do your duty throughly, I advise you. Imagine \u2019twere the right Vincentio. BIONDELLO. Tut! fear not me. TRANIO. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista? BIONDELLO. I told him that your father was at Venice, And that you look\u2019d for him this day in Padua. TRANIO. Th\u2019art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink. Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir. Enter Baptista and Lucentio. Signior Baptista, you are happily met. [To the Pedant] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of; I pray you stand good father to me now; Give me Bianca for my patrimony. PEDANT. Soft, son! Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself: And,\u2014for the good report I hear of you, And for the love he beareth to your daughter, And she to him,\u2014to stay him not too long, I am content, in a good father\u2019s care, To have him match\u2019d; and, if you please to like No worse than I, upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestow\u2019d; For curious I cannot be with you, Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.", " PEDANT. Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, Pisa renowned for grave citizens. TRANIO. Among them know you one Vincentio? PEDANT. I know him not, but I have heard of him, A merchant of incomparable wealth. TRANIO. He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say, In countenance somewhat doth resemble you. BIONDELLO. [Aside.] As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one. TRANIO. To save your life in this extremity, This favour will I do you for his sake; And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio. His name and credit shall you undertake, And in my house you shall be friendly lodg\u2019d; Look that you take upon you as you should! You understand me, sir; so shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city. If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it. PEDANT. O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty. TRANIO. Then go with me to make the matter good. This, by the way, I let you understand: My father is here look\u2019d for every day To pass assurance of a dower in marriage \u2019Twixt me and one Baptista\u2019s daughter here: In all these circumstances I\u2019ll instruct you. Go with me to clothe you as becomes you. [Exeunt.] SCENE III. A room in PETRUCHIO\u2019S house. Enter Katherina and Grumio. GRUMIO. No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life. KATHERINA. The more my wrong, the more his spite appears. What, did he marry me to famish me? Beggars that come unto my father\u2019s door Upon entreaty have a present alms; If not, elsewhere they meet with charity; But I, who never knew how to entreat, Nor never needed that I should entreat, Am starv\u2019d for meat, giddy for lack of sleep; With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed."], "Who becomes Bianca\u2019sLatin teacher?": [" BAPTISTA. Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina! KATHERINA. What is your will sir, that you send for me? PETRUCHIO. Where is your sister, and Hortensio\u2019s wife? KATHERINA. They sit conferring by the parlour fire. PETRUCHIO. Go fetch them hither; if they deny to come, Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands. Away, I say, and bring them hither straight. [Exit Katherina.] LUCENTIO. Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder. HORTENSIO. And so it is. I wonder what it bodes. PETRUCHIO. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life, An awful rule, and right supremacy; And, to be short, what not that\u2019s sweet and happy. BAPTISTA. Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio! The wager thou hast won; and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns; Another dowry to another daughter, For she is chang\u2019d, as she had never been. PETRUCHIO. Nay, I will win my wager better yet, And show more sign of her obedience, Her new-built virtue and obedience. See where she comes, and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion. Re-enter Katherina with Bianca and Widow. Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not: Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot. [Katherina pulls off her cap and throws it down.] WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass! BIANCA. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this? LUCENTIO. I would your duty were as foolish too; The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!", " [Exit.] SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA\u2019S house. Enter Tranio and Hortensio. TRANIO. Is \u2019t possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio? I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand. HORTENSIO. Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said, Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching. [They stand aside.] Enter Bianca and Lucentio. LUCENTIO. Now, mistress, profit you in what you read? BIANCA. What, master, read you? First resolve me that. LUCENTIO. I read that I profess, The Art to Love. BIANCA. And may you prove, sir, master of your art! LUCENTIO. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart. [They retire.] HORTENSIO. Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray, You that durst swear that your Mistress Bianca Lov\u2019d none in the world so well as Lucentio. TRANIO. O despiteful love! unconstant womankind! I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful. HORTENSIO. Mistake no more; I am not Licio. Nor a musician as I seem to be; But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentleman And makes a god of such a cullion: Know, sir, that I am call\u2019d Hortensio. TRANIO. Signior Hortensio, I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca; And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, I will with you, if you be so contented, Forswear Bianca and her love for ever. HORTENSIO. See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio, Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more, but do forswear her, As one unworthy all the former favours That I have fondly flatter\u2019d her withal.", " HORTENSIO. From all such devils, good Lord deliver us! GREMIO. And me, too, good Lord! TRANIO. Husht, master! Here\u2019s some good pastime toward: That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward. LUCENTIO. But in the other\u2019s silence do I see Maid\u2019s mild behaviour and sobriety. Peace, Tranio! TRANIO. Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill. BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, that I may soon make good What I have said,\u2014Bianca, get you in: And let it not displease thee, good Bianca, For I will love thee ne\u2019er the less, my girl. KATHERINA. A pretty peat! it is best put finger in the eye, and she knew why. BIANCA. Sister, content you in my discontent. Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe: My books and instruments shall be my company, On them to look, and practise by myself. LUCENTIO. Hark, Tranio! thou mayst hear Minerva speak. HORTENSIO. Signior Baptista, will you be so strange? Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca\u2019s grief. GREMIO. Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell, And make her bear the penance of her tongue? BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv\u2019d. Go in, Bianca. [Exit Bianca.] And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments, and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio, Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such, Prefer them hither; for to cunning men I will be very kind, and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up; And so, farewell.", " TRANIO. And here I take the like unfeigned oath, Never to marry with her though she would entreat; Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him! HORTENSIO. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn! For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov\u2019d me As I have lov\u2019d this proud disdainful haggard. And so farewell, Signior Lucentio. Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, Shall win my love; and so I take my leave, In resolution as I swore before. [Exit Hortensio. Lucentio and Bianca advance.] TRANIO. Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace As \u2019longeth to a lover\u2019s blessed case! Nay, I have ta\u2019en you napping, gentle love, And have forsworn you with Hortensio. BIANCA. Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me? TRANIO. Mistress, we have. LUCENTIO. Then we are rid of Licio. TRANIO. I\u2019 faith, he\u2019ll have a lusty widow now, That shall be woo\u2019d and wedded in a day. BIANCA. God give him joy! TRANIO. Ay, and he\u2019ll tame her. BIANCA. He says so, Tranio. TRANIO. Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school. BIANCA. The taming-school! What, is there such a place? TRANIO. Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master, That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long, To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue. Enter Biondello, running. BIONDELLO. O master, master! I have watch\u2019d so long That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied An ancient angel coming down the hill Will serve the turn."], "How does Petruchioset his wedding date?": [" PETRUCHIO. Father, \u2019tis thus: yourself and all the world That talk\u2019d of her have talk\u2019d amiss of her: If she be curst, it is for policy, For she\u2019s not froward, but modest as the dove; She is not hot, but temperate as the morn; For patience she will prove a second Grissel, And Roman Lucrece for her chastity; And to conclude, we have \u2019greed so well together That upon Sunday is the wedding-day. KATHERINA. I\u2019ll see thee hang\u2019d on Sunday first. GREMIO. Hark, Petruchio; she says she\u2019ll see thee hang\u2019d first. TRANIO. Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part! PETRUCHIO. Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself; If she and I be pleas\u2019d, what\u2019s that to you? \u2019Tis bargain\u2019d \u2019twixt us twain, being alone, That she shall still be curst in company. I tell you, \u2019tis incredible to believe How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, That in a twink she won me to her love. O! you are novices: \u2019tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice, To buy apparel \u2019gainst the wedding-day. Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests; I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine. BAPTISTA. I know not what to say; but give me your hands. God send you joy, Petruchio! \u2019Tis a match. GREMIO, TRANIO. Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.", " BIANCA. Is it for him you do envy me so? Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while: I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands. KATHERINA. If that be jest, then all the rest was so. [Strikes her.] Enter Baptista. BAPTISTA. Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence? Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps. Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her. For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit, Why dost thou wrong her that did ne\u2019er wrong thee? When did she cross thee with a bitter word? KATHERINA. Her silence flouts me, and I\u2019ll be reveng\u2019d. [Flies after Bianca.] BAPTISTA. What! in my sight? Bianca, get thee in. [Exit Bianca.] KATHERINA. What! will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see She is your treasure, she must have a husband; I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day, And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell. Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge. [Exit.] BAPTISTA. Was ever gentleman thus griev\u2019d as I? But who comes here? Enter Gremio, with Lucentio in the habit of a mean man; Petruchio, with Hortensio as a musician; and Tranio, with Biondello bearing a lute and books. GREMIO. Good morrow, neighbour Baptista. BAPTISTA. Good morrow, neighbour Gremio. God save you, gentlemen! PETRUCHIO. And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter Call\u2019d Katherina, fair and virtuous? BAPTISTA. I have a daughter, sir, call\u2019d Katherina.", " GREMIO. Trembled and shook, for why, he stamp\u2019d and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him. But after many ceremonies done, He calls for wine: \u2018A health!\u2019 quoth he, as if He had been abroad, carousing to his mates After a storm; quaff\u2019d off the muscadel, And threw the sops all in the sexton\u2019s face, Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seem\u2019d to ask him sops as he was drinking. This done, he took the bride about the neck, And kiss\u2019d her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo. And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame; And after me, I know, the rout is coming. Such a mad marriage never was before. Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play. [Music plays.] Enter Petrucio, Katherina, Bianca, Baptista, Hortensio, Grumio and Train. PETRUCHIO. Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains: I know you think to dine with me today, And have prepar\u2019d great store of wedding cheer But so it is, my haste doth call me hence, And therefore here I mean to take my leave. BAPTISTA. Is\u2019t possible you will away tonight? PETRUCHIO. I must away today before night come. Make it no wonder: if you knew my business, You would entreat me rather go than stay. And, honest company, I thank you all, That have beheld me give away myself To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife. Dine with my father, drink a health to me. For I must hence; and farewell to you all.", " Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not: Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice, To change true rules for odd inventions. Enter a Servant. SERVANT. Mistress, your father prays you leave your books, And help to dress your sister\u2019s chamber up: You know tomorrow is the wedding-day. BIANCA. Farewell, sweet masters, both: I must be gone. [Exeunt Bianca and Servant.] LUCENTIO. Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay. [Exit.] HORTENSIO. But I have cause to pry into this pedant: Methinks he looks as though he were in love. Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble To cast thy wand\u2019ring eyes on every stale, Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging, Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing. [Exit.] SCENE II. The same. Before BAPTISTA\u2019S house. Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio, Katherina, Bianca, Lucentio and Attendants. BAPTISTA. [To Tranio.] Signior Lucentio, this is the \u2019pointed day That Katherine and Petruchio should be married, And yet we hear not of our son-in-law. What will be said? What mockery will it be To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage! What says Lucentio to this shame of ours? KATHERINA. No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc\u2019d To give my hand, oppos\u2019d against my heart, Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen; Who woo\u2019d in haste and means to wed at leisure. I told you, I, he was a frantic fool, Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour; And to be noted for a merry man, He\u2019ll woo a thousand, \u2019point the day of marriage, Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banns; Yet never means to wed where he hath woo\u2019d."], "What is a \u201cshrew,\u201das defined by this play?": [" SLY.

Take your assurance of her, cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum; to the church! take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses. If this be not that you look for, I have more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day. [Going.] LUCENTIO. Hear\u2019st thou, Biondello? BIONDELLO. I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir; and so adieu, sir.

Tranio, since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua, nursery of arts, I am arriv\u2019d for fruitful Lombardy, The pleasant garden of great Italy, And by my father\u2019s love and leave am arm\u2019d With his good will and thy good company, My trusty servant well approv\u2019d in all, Here let us breathe, and haply institute A course of learning and ingenious studies. Pisa, renowned for grave citizens, Gave me my being and my father first, A merchant of great traffic through the world, Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii. Vincentio\u2019s son, brought up in Florence, It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv\u2019d, To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds: And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, Virtue and that part of philosophy Will I apply that treats of happiness By virtue specially to be achiev\u2019d. Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep, And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst. TRANIO. Mi perdonato, gentle master mine; I am in all affected as yourself; Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. Only, good master, while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline, Let\u2019s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray; Or so devote to Aristotle\u2019s checks As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur\u2019d."], "Tranio pleads with Lucentio to not forget ___ while pursuing academics.": [" LUCENTIO. Gramercies, lad; go forward; this contents; The rest will comfort, for thy counsel\u2019s sound. TRANIO. Master, you look\u2019d so longly on the maid. Perhaps you mark\u2019d not what\u2019s the pith of all. LUCENTIO. O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face, Such as the daughter of Agenor had, That made great Jove to humble him to her hand, When with his knees he kiss\u2019d the Cretan strand. TRANIO. Saw you no more? mark\u2019d you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din? LUCENTIO. Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move, And with her breath she did perfume the air; Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her. TRANIO. Nay, then, \u2019tis time to stir him from his trance. I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid, Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands: Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd, That till the father rid his hands of her, Master, your love must live a maid at home; And therefore has he closely mew\u2019d her up, Because she will not be annoy\u2019d with suitors. LUCENTIO. Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father\u2019s he! But art thou not advis\u2019d he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her? TRANIO. Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now \u2019tis plotted. LUCENTIO. I have it, Tranio. TRANIO. Master, for my hand, Both our inventions meet and jump in one. LUCENTIO. Tell me thine first. TRANIO.

Basta, content thee, for I have it full. We have not yet been seen in any house, Nor can we be distinguish\u2019d by our faces For man or master: then it follows thus: Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead, Keep house and port and servants, as I should; I will some other be; some Florentine, Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa. \u2019Tis hatch\u2019d, and shall be so: Tranio, at once Uncase thee; take my colour\u2019d hat and cloak. When Biondello comes, he waits on thee; But I will charm him first to keep his tongue. [They exchange habits] TRANIO. So had you need.

Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes, While I make way from hence to save my life. You understand me? BIONDELLO. I, sir! Ne\u2019er a whit. LUCENTIO.

O! you are novices: \u2019tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice, To buy apparel \u2019gainst the wedding-day. Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests; I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine. BAPTISTA.

Would Katherine had never seen him though! [Exit weeping, followed by Bianca and others.] BAPTISTA. Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep, For such an injury would vex a very saint; Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour. Enter Biondello. Master, master! News! old news, and such news as you never heard of! BAPTISTA. Is it new and old too? How may that be? BIONDELLO. Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio\u2019s coming? BAPTISTA. Is he come? BIONDELLO. Why, no, sir. BAPTISTA. What then? BIONDELLO. He is coming. BAPTISTA. When will he be here? BIONDELLO. When he stands where I am and sees you there. TRANIO. But say, what to thine old news? BIONDELLO.

Go, fool, and whom thou keep\u2019st command. PETRUCHIO. Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?

A witty mother! witless else her son. PETRUCHIO. Am I not wise? KATHERINA. Yes; keep you warm. PETRUCHIO.

Happy the parents of so fair a child; Happier the man whom favourable stars Allot thee for his lovely bedfellow. PETRUCHIO. Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad: This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither\u2019d, And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is. KATHERINA.

Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all. PETRUCHIO.

For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit, Why dost thou wrong her that did ne\u2019er wrong thee? When did she cross thee with a bitter word? KATHERINA.

KATHERINA. I\u2019ll see thee hang\u2019d on Sunday first. GREMIO. Hark, Petruchio; she says she\u2019ll see thee hang\u2019d first. TRANIO. Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!

I tell you, \u2019tis incredible to believe How much she loves me: O! the kindest Kate She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, That in a twink she won me to her love. O! you are novices: \u2019tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice, To buy apparel \u2019gainst the wedding-day. Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests; I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine. BAPTISTA.

No, sir; God forbid; but ashamed to kiss. PETRUCHIO. Why, then, let\u2019s home again. Come, sirrah, let\u2019s away. KATHERINA. Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay. PETRUCHIO.

Tell him from me\u2014as he will win my love,\u2014 He bear himself with honourable action, Such as he hath observ\u2019d in noble ladies Unto their lords, by them accomplished; Such duty to the drunkard let him do, With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, And say \u2018What is\u2019t your honour will command, Wherein your lady and your humble wife May show her duty and make known her love?\u2019 And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, And with declining head into his bosom, Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy\u2019d To see her noble lord restor\u2019d to health, Who for this seven years hath esteemed him No better than a poor and loathsome beggar. And if the boy have not a woman\u2019s gift To rain a shower of commanded tears, An onion will do well for such a shift, Which, in a napkin being close convey\u2019d, Shall in despite enforce a watery eye."]}
