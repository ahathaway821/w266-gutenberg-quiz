Sir, at the farthest for a week or two; But then up farther, and as far as Rome; And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life. TRANIO. What countryman, I pray? PEDANT. Of Mantua. TRANIO. Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid, And come to Padua, careless of your life! PEDANT. My life, sir! How, I pray? for that goes hard. TRANIO. \u2019Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua. Know you not the cause? Your ships are stay\u2019d at Venice; and the Duke,\u2014 For private quarrel \u2019twixt your Duke and him,\u2014 Hath publish\u2019d and proclaim\u2019d it openly. \u2019Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come You might have heard it else proclaim\u2019d about.", " PEDANT. Alas, sir! it is worse for me than so; For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence, and must here deliver them. TRANIO. Well, sir, to do you courtesy, This will I do, and this I will advise you: First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa? PEDANT. Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, Pisa renowned for grave citizens. TRANIO. Among them know you one Vincentio? PEDANT. I know him not, but I have heard of him, A merchant of incomparable wealth. TRANIO. He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say, In countenance somewhat doth resemble you. BIONDELLO. [Aside.] As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one. TRANIO. To save your life in this extremity, This favour will I do you for his sake; And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio. His name and credit shall you undertake, And in my house you shall be friendly lodg\u2019d; Look that you take upon you as you should!", " HORTENSIO. Why, so this gallant will command the sun.

Ay, what else? and, but I be deceived, Signior Baptista may remember me, Near twenty years ago in Genoa, Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus. TRANIO. \u2019Tis well; and hold your own, in any case, With such austerity as \u2019longeth to a father. PEDANT. I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy; \u2019Twere good he were school\u2019d.

Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps? KATHERINA. Call you me daughter? Now I promise you You have show\u2019d a tender fatherly regard To wish me wed to one half lunatic, A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack, That thinks with oaths to face the matter out. PETRUCHIO. Father, \u2019tis thus: yourself and all the world That talk\u2019d of her have talk\u2019d amiss of her: If she be curst, it is for policy, For she\u2019s not froward, but modest as the dove; She is not hot, but temperate as the morn; For patience she will prove a second Grissel, And Roman Lucrece for her chastity; And to conclude, we have \u2019greed so well together That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.", " Call you this gamut?

Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day: First were we sad, fearing you would not come; Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.

Hark, Tranio! thou mayst hear Minerva speak. HORTENSIO. Signior Baptista, will you be so strange? Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca\u2019s grief. GREMIO. Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell, And make her bear the penance of her tongue? BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv\u2019d. Go in, Bianca. [Exit Bianca.] And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments, and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio, Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such, Prefer them hither; for to cunning men I will be very kind, and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up; And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay; For I have more to commune with Bianca.", " HORTENSIO. See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio, Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more, but do forswear her, As one unworthy all the former favours That I have fondly flatter\u2019d her withal. TRANIO. And here I take the like unfeigned oath, Never to marry with her though she would entreat; Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him! HORTENSIO. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn! For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, I will be married to a wealthy widow Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov\u2019d me As I have lov\u2019d this proud disdainful haggard. And so farewell, Signior Lucentio. Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, Shall win my love; and so I take my leave, In resolution as I swore before. [Exit Hortensio.

Farewell: yet, for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father. HORTENSIO. So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,\u2014that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca\u2019s love,\u2014to labour and effect one thing specially.

Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is: why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne\u2019er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two-and-fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.", " Go, fool, and whom thou keep\u2019st command.

Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed; And therefore, setting all this chat aside, Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented That you shall be my wife your dowry \u2019greed on; And will you, nill you, I will marry you. Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn; For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,\u2014 Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,\u2014 Thou must be married to no man but me; For I am he am born to tame you, Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates.", " PETRUCHIO.

So may you lose your arms: If you strike me, you are no gentleman; And if no gentleman, why then no arms. PETRUCHIO. A herald, Kate? O! put me in thy books. KATHERINA. What is your crest? a coxcomb? PETRUCHIO. A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen. KATHERINA. No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven. PETRUCHIO. Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour. KATHERINA. It is my fashion when I see a crab. PETRUCHIO. Why, here\u2019s no crab, and therefore look not sour. KATHERINA. There is, there is. PETRUCHIO. Then show it me. KATHERINA. Had I a glass I would.

Re-enter Katherina with Bianca and Widow. Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not: Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot. [Katherina pulls off her cap and throws it down.] WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass! BIANCA. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this? LUCENTIO. I would your duty were as foolish too; The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time! BIANCA. The more fool you for laying on my duty. PETRUCHIO. Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands. WIDOW. Come, come, you\u2019re mocking; we will have no telling. PETRUCHIO.
