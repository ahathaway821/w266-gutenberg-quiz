{"What is the nameof Sissy\u2019s father\u2019s dog?": [" \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth. And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as if he was in pain. And I said, \u201cHave you hurt yourself, father?\u201d (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, \u201cA little, my darling.\u201d And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying. The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first he shook all over, and said nothing but \u201cMy darling;\u201d and \u201cMy love!\u201d\u2019 Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much of that at present.", " Perthon of the name of Thleary, in the Horthe-Riding way\u2014thtout man\u2014game eye?\u201d And whether that dog mightn\u2019t have thed, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t thay I know him mythelf, but I know a dog that I think would be likely to be acquainted with him.\u201d And whether that dog mightn\u2019t have thought it over, and thed, \u201cThleary, Thleary! O yeth, to be thure! A friend of mine menthioned him to me at one time. I can get you hith addreth directly.\u201d In conthequenth of my being afore the public, and going about tho muth, you thee, there mutht be a number of dogth acquainted with me, Thquire, that _I_ don\u2019t know!\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this speculation. \u2018Any way,\u2019 said Sleary, after putting his lips to his brandy and water, \u2018ith fourteen month ago, Thquire, thinthe we wath at Chethter. We wath getting up our Children in the Wood one morning, when there cometh into our Ring, by the thtage door, a dog. He had travelled a long way, he wath in a very bad condithon, he wath lame, and pretty well blind. He went round to our children, one after another, as if he wath a theeking for a child he know\u2019d; and then he come to me, and throwd hithelf up behind, and thtood on hith two forelegth, weak ath he wath, and then he wagged hith tail and died. Thquire, that dog wath Merrylegth.\u2019 \u2018Sissy\u2019s father\u2019s dog!\u2019 \u2018Thethilia\u2019th father\u2019th old dog. Now, Thquire, I can take my oath, from my knowledge of that dog, that that man wath dead\u2014and buried\u2014afore that dog come back to me.", " Likewithe if you wath to thtand a collar for the dog, or a thet of bellth for the horthe, I thould be very glad to take \u2019em. Brandy and water I alwayth take.\u2019 He had already called for a glass, and now called for another. \u2018If you wouldn\u2019t think it going too far, Thquire, to make a little thpread for the company at about three and thixth ahead, not reckoning Luth, it would make \u2019em happy.\u2019 All these little tokens of his gratitude, Mr. Gradgrind very willingly undertook to render. Though he thought them far too slight, he said, for such a service. \u2018Very well, Thquire; then, if you\u2019ll only give a Horthe-riding, a bethpeak, whenever you can, you\u2019ll more than balanthe the account. Now, Thquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, I thould like one parting word with you.\u2019 Louisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; Mr. Sleary, stirring and drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went on: \u2018Thquire,\u2014you don\u2019t need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.\u2019 \u2018Their instinct,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018is surprising.\u2019 \u2018Whatever you call it\u2014and I\u2019m bletht if _I_ know what to call it\u2019\u2014said Sleary, \u2018it ith athtonithing. The way in whith a dog\u2019ll find you\u2014the dithtanthe he\u2019ll come!\u2019 \u2018His scent,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018being so fine.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m bletht if I know what to call it,\u2019 repeated Sleary, shaking his head, \u2018but I have had dogth find me, Thquire, in a way that made me think whether that dog hadn\u2019t gone to another dog, and thed, \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know a perthon of the name of Thleary, do you?", " Sometimes they played tricks upon him; but they never knew how he felt them, and shrunk up, when he was alone with me. He was far, far timider than they thought!\u2019 \u2018And you were his comfort through everything?\u2019 She nodded, with the tears rolling down her face. \u2018I hope so, and father said I was. It was because he grew so scared and trembling, and because he felt himself to be a poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to be his words), that he wanted me so much to know a great deal, and be different from him. I used to read to him to cheer his courage, and he was very fond of that. They were wrong books\u2014I am never to speak of them here\u2014but we didn\u2019t know there was any harm in them.\u2019 \u2018And he liked them?\u2019 said Louisa, with a searching gaze on Sissy all this time. \u2018O very much! They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm. And often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or would have her head cut off before it was finished.\u2019 \u2018And your father was always kind? To the last?\u2019 asked Louisa contravening the great principle, and wondering very much. \u2018Always, always!\u2019 returned Sissy, clasping her hands. \u2018Kinder and kinder than I can tell. He was angry only one night, and that was not to me, but Merrylegs. Merrylegs;\u2019 she whispered the awful fact; \u2018is his performing dog.\u2019 \u2018Why was he angry with the dog?\u2019 Louisa demanded."], "What is the mainprinciple of Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s philosophy?": [" Good-bye, Thethilia!\u2019 \u2018Good-bye, Cecilia!\u2019 \u2018Good-bye, Sissy!\u2019 \u2018God bless you, dear!\u2019 In a variety of voices from all the room. But the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine oils in her bosom, and he now interposed with \u2018Leave the bottle, my dear; ith large to carry; it will be of no uthe to you now. Give it to me!\u2019 \u2018No, no!\u2019 she said, in another burst of tears. \u2018Oh, no! Pray let me keep it for father till he comes back! He will want it when he comes back. He had never thought of going away, when he sent me for it. I must keep it for him, if you please!\u2019 \u2018Tho be it, my dear. (You thee how it ith, Thquire!) Farewell, Thethilia! My latht wordth to you ith thith, Thtick to the termth of your engagement, be obedient to the Thquire, and forget uth. But if, when you\u2019re grown up and married and well off, you come upon any horthe-riding ever, don\u2019t be hard upon it, don\u2019t be croth with it, give it a Bethpeak if you can, and think you might do wurth. People mutht be amuthed, Thquire, thomehow,\u2019 continued Sleary, rendered more pursy than ever, by so much talking; \u2018they can\u2019t be alwayth a working, nor yet they can\u2019t be alwayth a learning. Make the betht of uth; not the wurtht. I\u2019ve got my living out of the horthe-riding all my life, I know; but I conthider that I lay down the philothophy of the thubject when I thay to you, Thquire, make the betht of uth: not the wurtht!\u2019 The Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs and the fixed eye of Philosophy\u2014and its rolling eye, too\u2014soon lost the three figures and the basket in the darkness of the street.", " Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind; and I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed, would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank.\u2019 \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would have said, See how miserable I am! \u2018Bitzer, I have but one chance left to soften you. You were many years at my school. If, in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son, I entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance.\u2019 \u2018I really wonder, sir,\u2019 rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative manner, \u2018to find you taking a position so untenable. My schooling was paid for; it was a bargain; and when I came away, the bargain ended.\u2019 It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid for. Nobody was ever on any account to give anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase. Gratitude was to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be. Every inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a bargain across a counter. And if we didn\u2019t get to Heaven that way, it was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there. \u2018I don\u2019t deny,\u2019 added Bitzer, \u2018that my schooling was cheap.", " It was not so unlike her father\u2019s principles, and her early training, that it need startle her. Where was the great difference between the two schools, when each chained her down to material realities, and inspired her with no faith in anything else? What was there in her soul for James Harthouse to destroy, which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its state of innocence! It was even the worse for her at this pass, that in her mind\u2014implanted there before her eminently practical father began to form it\u2014a struggling disposition to believe in a wider and nobler humanity than she had ever heard of, constantly strove with doubts and resentments. With doubts, because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth. With resentments, because of the wrong that had been done her, if it were indeed a whisper of the truth. Upon a nature long accustomed to self-suppression, thus torn and divided, the Harthouse philosophy came as a relief and justification. Everything being hollow and worthless, she had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing. What did it matter, she had said to her father, when he proposed her husband. What did it matter, she said still. With a scornful self-reliance, she asked herself, What did anything matter\u2014and went on. Towards what? Step by step, onward and downward, towards some end, yet so gradually, that she believed herself to remain motionless. As to Mr. Harthouse, whither _he_ tended, he neither considered nor cared.", " Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything? Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can have got into the house? Because, in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so incomprehensible.\u2019 \u2018Stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility. \u2018You have one of those strollers\u2019 children in the school.\u2019 \u2018Cecilia Jupe, by name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken look at his friend. \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby."], "Mrs. Pegler isthe mother of which character?": [" Pegler glanced timidly but proudly round the walls\u2014\u2018such a fine house as this. Indeed, indeed, it is not my fault! My dear, noble, stately boy! I have always lived quiet, and secret, Josiah, my dear. I have never broken the condition once. I have never said I was your mother. I have admired you at a distance; and if I have come to town sometimes, with long times between, to take a proud peep at you, I have done it unbeknown, my love, and gone away again.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets, walked in impatient mortification up and down at the side of the long dining-table, while the spectators greedily took in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler\u2019s appeal, and at each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed. Mr. Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr. Gradgrind addressed that maligned old lady: \u2018I am surprised, madam,\u2019 he observed with severity, \u2018that in your old age you have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son, after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him.\u2019 \u2018_Me_ unnatural!\u2019 cried poor old Mrs. Pegler. \u2018_Me_ inhuman! To my dear boy?\u2019 \u2018Dear!\u2019 repeated Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Yes; dear in his self-made prosperity, madam, I dare say. Not very dear, however, when you deserted him in his infancy, and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother.\u2019 \u2018_I_ deserted my Josiah!\u2019 cried Mrs. Pegler, clasping her hands. \u2018Now, Lord forgive you, sir, for your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal against the memory of my poor mother, who died in my arms before Josiah was born.", " \u2018I ha never thowt yet, missus,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018o\u2019 askin thy name.\u2019 The old lady announced herself as \u2018Mrs. Pegler.\u2019 \u2018A widder, I think?\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Oh, many long years!\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s husband (one of the best on record) was already dead, by Mrs. Pegler\u2019s calculation, when Stephen was born. \u2018\u2019Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Onny children?\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted some nervousness on her part. \u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018Not now, not now.\u2019 \u2018Dead, Stephen,\u2019 Rachael softly hinted. \u2018I\u2019m sooary I ha spok\u2019n on \u2019t,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018I ought t\u2019 hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place. I\u2014I blame myseln.\u2019 While he excused himself, the old lady\u2019s cup rattled more and more. \u2018I had a son,\u2019 she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; \u2018and he did well, wonderfully well. But he is not to be spoken of if you please. He is\u2014\u2019 Putting down her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have added, by her action, \u2018dead!\u2019 Then she said aloud, \u2018I have lost him.\u2019 Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear. Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was uttered. \u2018Bounderby!\u2019 she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. \u2018Oh hide me!", " And I never have, except with looking at him once a year, when he has never knowed it. And it\u2019s right,\u2019 said poor old Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate championship, \u2018that I _should_ keep down in my own part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a many unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my pride in my Josiah to myself, and I can love for love\u2019s own sake! And I am ashamed of you, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Pegler, lastly, \u2018for your slanders and suspicions. And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no. And I shouldn\u2019t be here now, if it hadn\u2019t been for being brought here. And for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my son standing here to tell you so different!\u2019 The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had never ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and larger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short. \u2018I don\u2019t exactly know,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018how I come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company, but I don\u2019t inquire. When they\u2019re quite satisfied, perhaps they\u2019ll be so good as to disperse; whether they\u2019re satisfied or not, perhaps they\u2019ll be so good as to disperse.", " May you repent of it, sir, and live to know better!\u2019 She was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind, shocked by the possibility which dawned upon him, said in a gentler tone: \u2018Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son to\u2014to be brought up in the gutter?\u2019 \u2018Josiah in the gutter!\u2019 exclaimed Mrs. Pegler. \u2018No such a thing, sir. Never! For shame on you! My dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to know, that though he come of humble parents, he come of parents that loved him as dear as the best could, and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he might write and cipher beautiful, and I\u2019ve his books at home to show it! Aye, have I!\u2019 said Mrs. Pegler, with indignant pride. \u2018And my dear boy knows, and will give _you_ to know, sir, that after his beloved father died, when he was eight years old, his mother, too, could pinch a bit, as it was her duty and her pleasure and her pride to do it, to help him out in life, and put him \u2019prentice. And a steady lad he was, and a kind master he had to lend him a hand, and well he worked his own way forward to be rich and thriving. And _I_\u2019ll give you to know, sir\u2014for this my dear boy won\u2019t\u2014that though his mother kept but a little village shop, he never forgot her, but pensioned me on thirty pound a year\u2014more than I want, for I put by out of it\u2014only making the condition that I was to keep down in my own part, and make no boasts about him, and not trouble him."], "Who robs the bank?": [" \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you\u2019ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I\u2019ll mention it. Never mind a light, man!\u2019 Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. \u2018It don\u2019t want a light.\u2019 Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand. \u2018I say!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I think I can do you a good turn. Don\u2019t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there\u2019s no harm in my trying.\u2019 His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\u2019s ear, it was so hot. \u2018That was our light porter at the Bank,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018who brought you the message to-night. I call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.\u2019 Stephen thought, \u2018What a hurry he is in!\u2019 He spoke so confusedly. \u2018Well!\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! When are you off?\u2019 \u2018T\u2019 day\u2019s Monday,\u2019 replied Stephen, considering. \u2018Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh \u2019bout.\u2019 \u2018Friday or Saturday,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you\u2014that\u2019s my sister, you know, in your room\u2014but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there\u2019s no harm done. So I tell you what. You\u2019ll know our light porter again?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sure,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Very well,\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018When you leave work of a night, between this and your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?", " But I touch him up with you when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an understanding. I say! Has father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday, Loo?\u2019 \u2018No, Tom. But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning.\u2019 \u2018Ah! That\u2019s what I mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Do you know where he is to-night?\u2019\u2014with a very deep expression. \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll tell you. He\u2019s with old Bounderby. They are having a regular confab together up at the Bank. Why at the Bank, do you think? Well, I\u2019ll tell you again. To keep Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s ears as far off as possible, I expect.\u2019 With her hand upon her brother\u2019s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire. Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him. \u2018You are very fond of me, an\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 \u2018Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me.\u2019 \u2018Well, sister of mine,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018when you say that, you are near my thoughts. We might be so much oftener together\u2014mightn\u2019t we? Always together, almost\u2014mightn\u2019t we? It would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what, Loo. It would be a splendid thing for me. It would be uncommonly jolly!\u2019 Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny. He could make nothing of her face. He pressed her in his arm, and kissed her cheek. She returned the kiss, but still looked at the fire.", " \u2018Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told her! Never knew her do such a thing before. Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!\u2019 She still looked faint and pale. James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed. \u2018Why, I am going to tell you,\u2019 said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you before. You know this lady (for she _is_ a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?\u2019 \u2018I have already had the honour\u2014\u2019 \u2018Very well. And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him too on the same occasion?\u2019 Mr. Harthouse inclined his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead. \u2018Very well. They live at the Bank. You know they live at the Bank, perhaps? Very well. Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything was put away as usual. In the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much. In the little safe in young Tom\u2019s closet, the safe used for petty purposes, there was a hundred and fifty odd pound.\u2019 \u2018A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Come!\u2019 retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him, \u2018let\u2019s have none of _your_ interruptions. It\u2019s enough to be robbed while you\u2019re snoring because you\u2019re too comfortable, without being put right with _your_ four seven ones.", " Thou\u2019rt beside it now. Thou mak\u2019st me see it wi\u2019 a better eye. Bless thee. Good night. Good-bye!\u2019 It was but a hurried parting in a common street, yet it was a sacred remembrance to these two common people. Utilitarian economists, skeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact, genteel and used-up infidels, gabblers of many little dog\u2019s-eared creeds, the poor you will have always with you. Cultivate in them, while there is yet time, the utmost graces of the fancies and affections, to adorn their lives so much in need of ornament; or, in the day of your triumph, when romance is utterly driven out of their souls, and they and a bare existence stand face to face, Reality will take a wolfish turn, and make an end of you. Stephen worked the next day, and the next, uncheered by a word from any one, and shunned in all his comings and goings as before. At the end of the second day, he saw land; at the end of the third, his loom stood empty. He had overstayed his hour in the street outside the Bank, on each of the two first evenings; and nothing had happened there, good or bad. That he might not be remiss in his part of the engagement, he resolved to wait full two hours, on this third and last night. There was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby\u2019s house, sitting at the first-floor window as he had seen her before; and there was the light porter, sometimes talking with her there, and sometimes looking over the blind below which had BANK upon it, and sometimes coming to the door and standing on the steps for a breath of air."], "What is the commonname for poor Coketown factory workers?": [" The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round the placards, devouring them with eager eyes. Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read. These people, as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud\u2014there was always some such ready to help them\u2014stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil. Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling wheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets, there were still as many readers as before. Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had brought it in his pocket. Oh, my friends and fellow-countrymen, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown, oh, my fellow-brothers and fellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellow-men, what a to-do was there, when Slackbridge unfolded what he called \u2018that damning document,\u2019 and held it up to the gaze, and for the execration of the working-man community! \u2018Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what a traitor in the camp of those great spirits who are enrolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and of Union, is appropriately capable!", " Besides Mr. Bounderby\u2019s gold spoon which was generally received in Coketown, another prevalent fiction was very popular there. It took the form of a threat. Whenever a Coketowner felt he was ill-used\u2014that is to say, whenever he was not left entirely alone, and it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences of any of his acts\u2014he was sure to come out with the awful menace, that he would \u2018sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic.\u2019 This had terrified the Home Secretary within an inch of his life, on several occasions. However, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that they never had pitched their property into the Atlantic yet, but, on the contrary, had been kind enough to take mighty good care of it. So there it was, in the haze yonder; and it increased and multiplied. The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun was so bright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown, and could not be looked at steadily. Stokers emerged from low underground doorways into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts, and palings, wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals. The whole town seemed to be frying in oil. There was a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere. The steam-engines shone with it, the dresses of the Hands were soiled with it, the mills throughout their many stories oozed and trickled it. The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled languidly in the desert.", " \u2018I say, Loo! I thought I\u2019d come, and just hint to you what was going on: though I supposed you\u2019d most likely guess, even if you didn\u2019t know. I can\u2019t stay, because I\u2019m engaged to some fellows to-night. You won\u2019t forget how fond you are of me?\u2019 \u2018No, dear Tom, I won\u2019t forget.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a capital girl,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Good-bye, Loo.\u2019 She gave him an affectionate good-night, and went out with him to the door, whence the fires of Coketown could be seen, making the distance lurid. She stood there, looking steadfastly towards them, and listening to his departing steps. They retreated quickly, as glad to get away from Stone Lodge; and she stood there yet, when he was gone and all was quiet. It seemed as if, first in her own fire within the house, and then in the fiery haze without, she tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he had already spun into a woman. But his factory is a secret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes. CHAPTER XV FATHER AND DAUGHTER ALTHOUGH Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard, his room was quite a blue chamber in its abundance of blue books. Whatever they could prove (which is usually anything you like), they proved there, in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits. In that charmed apartment, the most complicated social questions were cast up, got into exact totals, and finally settled\u2014if those concerned could only have been brought to know it.", " So, Stephen Blackpool\u2019s tombstone, with her father\u2019s record of his death, was almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be. These things she could plainly see. But, how much of the Future? A working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once again appearing at the ringing of the Factory bell, and passing to and fro at the set hours, among the Coketown Hands; a woman of pensive beauty, always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and even cheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have compassion on a degraded, drunken wretch of her own sex, who was sometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her, and crying to her; a woman working, ever working, but content to do it, and preferring to do it as her natural lot, until she should be too old to labour any more? Did Louisa see this? Such a thing was to be. A lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on paper blotted with tears, that her words had too soon come true, and that all the treasures in the world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her dear face? At length this brother coming nearer home, with hope of seeing her, and being delayed by illness; and then a letter, in a strange hand, saying \u2018he died in hospital, of fever, such a day, and died in penitence and love of you: his last word being your name\u2019? Did Louisa see these things? Such things were to be. Herself again a wife\u2014a mother\u2014lovingly watchful of her children, ever careful that they should have a childhood of the mind no less than a childhood of the body, as knowing it to be even a more beautiful thing, and a possession, any hoarded scrap of which, is a blessing and happiness to the wisest?"], "Sissy believesher father abandoned her for what reason?": [" \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth. And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as if he was in pain. And I said, \u201cHave you hurt yourself, father?\u201d (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, \u201cA little, my darling.\u201d And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying. The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first he shook all over, and said nothing but \u201cMy darling;\u201d and \u201cMy love!\u201d\u2019 Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much of that at present.", " It\u2019s as much as he can do to write; and it\u2019s more than people in general can do to read his writing. Though it\u2019s plain to _me_.\u2019 \u2018Your mother?\u2019 \u2018Father says she was quite a scholar. She died when I was born. She was;\u2019 Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; \u2018she was a dancer.\u2019 \u2018Did your father love her?\u2019 Louisa asked these questions with a strong, wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and hiding in solitary places. \u2018O yes! As dearly as he loves me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from that time.\u2019 \u2018Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do. When he left me for my good\u2014he never would have left me for his own\u2014I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial. He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back.\u2019 \u2018Tell me more about him,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018I will never ask you again. Where did you live?\u2019 \u2018We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in. Father\u2019s a;\u2019 Sissy whispered the awful word, \u2018a clown.\u2019 \u2018To make the people laugh?\u2019 said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence. \u2018Yes. But they wouldn\u2019t laugh sometimes, and then father cried. Lately, they very often wouldn\u2019t laugh, and he used to come home despairing. Father\u2019s not like most. Those who didn\u2019t know him as well as I do, and didn\u2019t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right.", " The reason is (as you know) the only faculty to which education should be addressed. \u2018And yet, Bounderby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day, though in itself a trifling one, as if something had crept into Thomas\u2019s and Louisa\u2019s minds which is\u2014or rather, which is not\u2014I don\u2019t know that I can express myself better than by saying\u2014which has never been intended to be developed, and in which their reason has no part.\u2019 \u2018There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds,\u2019 returned Bounderby. \u2018When I was a vagabond myself, nobody looked with any interest at _me_; I know that.\u2019 \u2018Then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his eyes on the fire, \u2018in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you in what. In idle imagination.\u2019 \u2018I hope not,\u2019 said the eminently practical; \u2018I confess, however, that the misgiving _has_ crossed me on my way home.\u2019 \u2018In idle imagination, Gradgrind,\u2019 repeated Bounderby. \u2018A very bad thing for anybody, but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa. I should ask Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s pardon for strong expressions, but that she knows very well I am not a refined character. Whoever expects refinement in _me_ will be disappointed. I hadn\u2019t a refined bringing up.\u2019 \u2018Whether,\u2019 said Gradgrind, pondering with his hands in his pockets, and his cavernous eyes on the fire, \u2018whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything?", " And that was wrong, too.\u2019 \u2018Of course it was.\u2019 \u2018Then Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said he would try me once more. And he said, Here are the stutterings\u2014\u2019 \u2018Statistics,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Yes, Miss Louisa\u2014they always remind me of stutterings, and that\u2019s another of my mistakes\u2014of accidents upon the sea. And I find (Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death. What is the percentage? And I said, Miss;\u2019 here Sissy fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest error; \u2018I said it was nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Miss\u2014to the relations and friends of the people who were killed. I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed."], "Which of the followingcharacters dies during the course of the novel?": [" Spite o\u2019 all that, they can be set free for smaller wrongs than mine. So, I mun be ridden o\u2019 this woman, and I want t\u2019 know how?\u2019 \u2018No how,\u2019 returned Mr. Bounderby. \u2018If I do her any hurt, sir, there\u2019s a law to punish me?\u2019 \u2018Of course there is.\u2019 \u2018If I flee from her, there\u2019s a law to punish me?\u2019 \u2018Of course there is.\u2019 \u2018If I marry t\u2019oother dear lass, there\u2019s a law to punish me?\u2019 \u2018Of course there is.\u2019 \u2018If I was to live wi\u2019 her an\u2019 not marry her\u2014saying such a thing could be, which it never could or would, an\u2019 her so good\u2014there\u2019s a law to punish me, in every innocent child belonging to me?\u2019 \u2018Of course there is.\u2019 \u2018Now, a\u2019 God\u2019s name,\u2019 said Stephen Blackpool, \u2018show me the law to help me!\u2019 \u2018Hem!

Whatsoever the public meeting held in Coketown, and whatsoever the subject of such meeting, some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical friend Gradgrind. This always pleased the eminently practical friend. He knew it to be his due, but his due was acceptable. He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which was neither town nor country, and yet was either spoiled, when his ears were invaded by the sound of music. The clashing and banging band attached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up its rest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray. A flag, floating from the summit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was \u2018Sleary\u2019s Horse-riding\u2019 which claimed their suffrages. Sleary himself, a stout modern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture, took the money. Miss Josephine Sleary, as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act. Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to \u2018elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing dog Merrylegs.\u2019 He was also to exhibit \u2018his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head, thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.\u2019 The same Signor Jupe was to \u2018enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.\u2019 Lastly, he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in \u2018the highly novel and laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor\u2019s Journey to Brentford.\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.", " \u2018He may be got abroad yet.\u2019 It was the more hopeful as the town to which Sissy had directed him was within three hours\u2019 journey of Liverpool, whence he could be swiftly dispatched to any part of the world. But, caution being necessary in communicating with him\u2014for there was a greater danger every moment of his being suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr. Bounderby himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might play a Roman part\u2014it was consented that Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in question, by a circuitous course, alone; and that the unhappy father, setting forth in an opposite direction, should get round to the same bourne by another and wider route. It was further agreed that he should not present himself to Mr. Sleary, lest his intentions should be mistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to take flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to Sissy and Louisa to open; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery and disgrace, of his father\u2019s being at hand and of the purpose for which they had come. When these arrangements had been well considered and were fully understood by all three, it was time to begin to carry them into execution. Early in the afternoon, Mr. Gradgrind walked direct from his own house into the country, to be taken up on the line by which he was to travel; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different course, encouraged by not seeing any face they knew.", " She hurried by the train to town, she ran from town to this house, through a raging storm, and presented herself before me in a state of distraction. Of course, she has remained here ever since. Let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to be more quiet.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments, in every direction except Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s direction; and then, abruptly turning upon the niece of Lady Scadgers, said to that wretched woman: \u2018Now, ma\u2019am! We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer, for going about the country at express pace, with no other luggage than a Cock-and-a-Bull, ma\u2019am!\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 whispered Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018my nerves are at present too much shaken, and my health is at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears.\u2019 (Which she did.) \u2018Well, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family, what I have got to add to that, is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge, namely, a coach. And the coach in which we came here being at the door, you\u2019ll allow me to hand you down to it, and pack you home to the Bank: where the best course for you to pursue, will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear, and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed.\u2019 With these words, Mr. Bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady, and escorted her to the conveyance in question, shedding many plaintive sneezes by the way."], "Who is Kidderminster?": [" \u2018By your leaves, gentlemen,\u2019 said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, glancing round the room. \u2018It was you, I believe, that were wishing to see Jupe!\u2019 \u2018It was,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018His daughter has gone to fetch him, but I can\u2019t wait; therefore, if you please, I will leave a message for him with you.\u2019 \u2018You see, my friend,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby put in, \u2018we are the kind of people who know the value of time, and you are the kind of people who don\u2019t know the value of time.\u2019 \u2018I have not,\u2019 retorted Mr. Childers, after surveying him from head to foot, \u2018the honour of knowing _you_,\u2014but if you mean that you can make more money of your time than I can of mine, I should judge from your appearance, that you are about right.\u2019 \u2018And when you have made it, you can keep it too, I should think,\u2019 said Cupid. \u2018Kidderminster, stow that!\u2019 said Mr. Childers. (Master Kidderminster was Cupid\u2019s mortal name.) \u2018What does he come here cheeking us for, then?\u2019 cried Master Kidderminster, showing a very irascible temperament. \u2018If you want to cheek us, pay your ochre at the doors and take it out.\u2019 \u2018Kidderminster,\u2019 said Mr. Childers, raising his voice, \u2018stow that!\u2014Sir,\u2019 to Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018I was addressing myself to you. You may or you may not be aware (for perhaps you have not been much in the audience), that Jupe has missed his tip very often, lately.\u2019 \u2018Has\u2014what has he missed?\u2019 asked Mr. Gradgrind, glancing at the potent Bounderby for assistance.", " If Mr. Sleary were taking the money, he would be sure to know her, and would proceed with discretion. If he were not, he would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what he had done with the fugitive, would proceed with discretion still. Therefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the well-remembered booth. The flag with the inscription SLEARY\u2019S HORSE-RIDING was there; and the Gothic niche was there; but Mr. Sleary was not there. Master Kidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received by the wildest credulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to the invincible force of circumstances (and his beard), and, in the capacity of a man who made himself generally useful, presided on this occasion over the exchequer\u2014having also a drum in reserve, on which to expend his leisure moments and superfluous forces. In the extreme sharpness of his look out for base coin, Mr. Kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw anything but money; so Sissy passed him unrecognised, and they went in. The Emperor of Japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled with black spots, was twirling five wash-hand basins at once, as it is the favourite recreation of that monarch to do. Sissy, though well acquainted with his Royal line, had no personal knowledge of the present Emperor, and his reign was peaceful. Miss Josephine Sleary, in her celebrated graceful Equestrian Tyrolean Flower Act, was then announced by a new clown (who humorously said Cauliflower Act), and Mr. Sleary appeared, leading her in.", " \u2018Missed his tip.\u2019 \u2018Offered at the Garters four times last night, and never done \u2019em once,\u2019 said Master Kidderminster. \u2018Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was loose in his ponging.\u2019 \u2018Didn\u2019t do what he ought to do. Was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling,\u2019 Mr. Childers interpreted. \u2018Oh!\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018that is tip, is it?\u2019 \u2018In a general way that\u2019s missing his tip,\u2019 Mr. E. W. B. Childers answered. \u2018Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners, and Ponging, eh!\u2019 ejaculated Bounderby, with his laugh of laughs. \u2018Queer sort of company, too, for a man who has raised himself!\u2019 \u2018Lower yourself, then,\u2019 retorted Cupid. \u2018Oh Lord! if you\u2019ve raised yourself so high as all that comes to, let yourself down a bit.\u2019 \u2018This is a very obtrusive lad!\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, turning, and knitting his brows on him. \u2018We\u2019d have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were coming,\u2019 retorted Master Kidderminster, nothing abashed. \u2018It\u2019s a pity you don\u2019t have a bespeak, being so particular. You\u2019re on the Tight-Jeff, ain\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018What does this unmannerly boy mean,\u2019 asked Mr. Gradgrind, eyeing him in a sort of desperation, \u2018by Tight-Jeff?\u2019 \u2018There! Get out, get out!\u2019 said Mr. Childers, thrusting his young friend from the room, rather in the prairie manner. \u2018Tight-Jeff or Slack-Jeff, it don\u2019t much signify: it\u2019s only tight-rope and slack-rope. You were going to give me a message for Jupe?\u2019 \u2018Yes, I was.\u2019 \u2018Then,\u2019 continued Mr. Childers, quickly, \u2018my opinion is, he will never receive it.", " \u2018Jupe sent his daughter out on an errand not an hour ago, and then was seen to slip out himself, with his hat over his eyes, and a bundle tied up in a handkerchief under his arm. She will never believe it of him, but he has cut away and left her.\u2019 \u2018Pray,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018why will she never believe it of him?\u2019 \u2018Because those two were one. Because they were never asunder. Because, up to this time, he seemed to dote upon her,\u2019 said Childers, taking a step or two to look into the empty trunk. Both Mr. Childers and Master Kidderminster walked in a curious manner; with their legs wider apart than the general run of men, and with a very knowing assumption of being stiff in the knees. This walk was common to all the male members of Sleary\u2019s company, and was understood to express, that they were always on horseback. \u2018Poor Sissy! He had better have apprenticed her,\u2019 said Childers, giving his hair another shake, as he looked up from the empty box. \u2018Now, he leaves her without anything to take to.\u2019 \u2018It is creditable to you, who have never been apprenticed, to express that opinion,\u2019 returned Mr. Gradgrind, approvingly. \u2018_I_ never apprenticed? I was apprenticed when I was seven year old.\u2019 \u2018Oh! Indeed?\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, rather resentfully, as having been defrauded of his good opinion. \u2018I was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to\u2014\u2019 \u2018Idleness,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh."], "What does Rachaelfind that leads her to believe Stephen has been murdered?": [" \u2018I ha never thowt yet, missus,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018o\u2019 askin thy name.\u2019 The old lady announced herself as \u2018Mrs. Pegler.\u2019 \u2018A widder, I think?\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Oh, many long years!\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s husband (one of the best on record) was already dead, by Mrs. Pegler\u2019s calculation, when Stephen was born. \u2018\u2019Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Onny children?\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted some nervousness on her part. \u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018Not now, not now.\u2019 \u2018Dead, Stephen,\u2019 Rachael softly hinted. \u2018I\u2019m sooary I ha spok\u2019n on \u2019t,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018I ought t\u2019 hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place. I\u2014I blame myseln.\u2019 While he excused himself, the old lady\u2019s cup rattled more and more. \u2018I had a son,\u2019 she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; \u2018and he did well, wonderfully well. But he is not to be spoken of if you please. He is\u2014\u2019 Putting down her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have added, by her action, \u2018dead!\u2019 Then she said aloud, \u2018I have lost him.\u2019 Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear. Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was uttered. \u2018Bounderby!\u2019 she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. \u2018Oh hide me!", " And yet I\u2014\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t mistrust her now, Rachael?\u2019 \u2018Now that you have brought us more together, no. But I can\u2019t at all times keep out of my mind\u2014\u2019 Her voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself, that Sissy, sitting by her side, was obliged to listen with attention. \u2018I can\u2019t at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one. I can\u2019t think who \u2019tis, I can\u2019t think how or why it may be done, but I mistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way. I mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord, and showing himself innocent before them all, some one would be confounded, who\u2014to prevent that\u2014has stopped him, and put him out of the way.\u2019 \u2018That is a dreadful thought,\u2019 said Sissy, turning pale. \u2018It _is_ a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered.\u2019 Sissy shuddered, and turned paler yet. \u2018When it makes its way into my mind, dear,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018and it will come sometimes, though I do all I can to keep it out, wi\u2019 counting on to high numbers as I work, and saying over and over again pieces that I knew when I were a child\u2014I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however tired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles. I must get the better of this before bed-time. I\u2019ll walk home wi\u2019 you.\u2019 \u2018He might fall ill upon the journey back,\u2019 said Sissy, faintly offering a worn-out scrap of hope; \u2018and in such a case, there are many places on the road where he might stop.\u2019 \u2018But he is in none of them.", " Still, if her father really has left her, without any connivance on her part\u2014Bounderby, let me have a word with you.\u2019 Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian walk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his face, and softly whistling. While thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby\u2019s voice as \u2018No. _I_ say no. I advise you not. I say by no means.\u2019 While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone the words, \u2018But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in. Think of it, Bounderby, in that point of view.\u2019 Meanwhile, the various members of Sleary\u2019s company gradually gathered together from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from standing about, talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers, gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room. There were two or three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands, and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children, who did the fairy business when required. The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the families on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often made a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the apex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins, ride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.", " \u2018I am glad you have come at last, Stephen. You are very late.\u2019 \u2018I ha\u2019 been walking up an\u2019 down.\u2019 \u2018I thought so. But \u2019tis too bad a night for that. The rain falls very heavy, and the wind has risen.\u2019 The wind? True. It was blowing hard. Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise! To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was blowing! \u2018I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen. Landlady came round for me at dinner-time. There was some one here that needed looking to, she said. And \u2018deed she was right. All wandering and lost, Stephen. Wounded too, and bruised.\u2019 He slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head before her. \u2018I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for that she worked with me when we were girls both, and for that you courted her and married her when I was her friend\u2014\u2019 He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan. \u2018And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure and certain that \u2019tis far too merciful to let her die, or even so much as suffer, for want of aid. Thou knowest who said, \u201cLet him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her!\u201d There have been plenty to do that. Thou art not the man to cast the last stone, Stephen, when she is brought so low.\u2019 \u2018O Rachael, Rachael!\u2019 \u2018Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward thee!\u2019 she said, in compassionate accents. \u2018I am thy poor friend, with all my heart and mind.\u2019 [Picture: Stephen and Rachael in the sick room] The wounds of which she had spoken, seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast."], "Who runs thecircus?": [" Do you know much of him?\u2019 \u2018I never saw the man in my life.\u2019 \u2018I doubt if you ever _will_ see him now. It\u2019s pretty plain to me, he\u2019s off.\u2019 \u2018Do you mean that he has deserted his daughter?\u2019 \u2018Ay! I mean,\u2019 said Mr. Childers, with a nod, \u2018that he has cut. He was goosed last night, he was goosed the night before last, he was goosed to-day. He has lately got in the way of being always goosed, and he can\u2019t stand it.\u2019 \u2018Why has he been\u2014so very much\u2014Goosed?\u2019 asked Mr. Gradgrind, forcing the word out of himself, with great solemnity and reluctance. \u2018His joints are turning stiff, and he is getting used up,\u2019 said Childers. \u2018He has his points as a Cackler still, but he can\u2019t get a living out of _them_.\u2019 \u2018A Cackler!\u2019 Bounderby repeated. \u2018Here we go again!\u2019 \u2018A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,\u2019 said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder, and accompanying it with a shake of his long hair\u2014which all shook at once. \u2018Now, it\u2019s a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper, to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with it.\u2019 \u2018Good!\u2019 interrupted Mr. Bounderby. \u2018This is good, Gradgrind! A man so fond of his daughter, that he runs away from her! This is devilish good! Ha! ha! Now, I\u2019ll tell you what, young man. I haven\u2019t always occupied my present station of life. I know what these things are. You may be astonished to hear it, but my mother\u2014ran away from _me_.\u2019 E. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to hear it."], "About how muchmoney is stolen from the bank?": [" \u2018I think so. But there are more of \u2019em in it. There\u2019s an old woman. One never hears of these things till the mischief\u2019s done; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen; there\u2019s an old woman turns up now. An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick, every now and then. _She_ watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals away with him and holds a council with him\u2014I suppose, to make her report on going off duty, and be damned to her.\u2019 There was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from observation, thought Louisa. \u2018This is not all of \u2019em, even as we already know \u2019em,\u2019 said Bounderby, with many nods of hidden meaning. \u2018But I have said enough for the present. You\u2019ll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no one. It may take time, but we shall have \u2019em. It\u2019s policy to give \u2019em line enough, and there\u2019s no objection to that.\u2019 \u2018Of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law, as notice-boards observe,\u2019 replied James Harthouse, \u2018and serve them right. Fellows who go in for Banks must take the consequences. If there were no consequences, we should all go in for Banks.\u2019 He had gently taken Louisa\u2019s parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked under its shade, though the sun did not shine there. \u2018For the present, Loo Bounderby,\u2019 said her husband, \u2018here\u2019s Mrs. Sparsit to look after.", " \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you\u2019ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I\u2019ll mention it. Never mind a light, man!\u2019 Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. \u2018It don\u2019t want a light.\u2019 Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand. \u2018I say!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I think I can do you a good turn. Don\u2019t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there\u2019s no harm in my trying.\u2019 His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\u2019s ear, it was so hot. \u2018That was our light porter at the Bank,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018who brought you the message to-night. I call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.\u2019 Stephen thought, \u2018What a hurry he is in!\u2019 He spoke so confusedly. \u2018Well!\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! When are you off?\u2019 \u2018T\u2019 day\u2019s Monday,\u2019 replied Stephen, considering. \u2018Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh \u2019bout.\u2019 \u2018Friday or Saturday,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you\u2014that\u2019s my sister, you know, in your room\u2014but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there\u2019s no harm done. So I tell you what. You\u2019ll know our light porter again?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sure,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Very well,\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018When you leave work of a night, between this and your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?", " But I touch him up with you when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an understanding. I say! Has father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday, Loo?\u2019 \u2018No, Tom. But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning.\u2019 \u2018Ah! That\u2019s what I mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Do you know where he is to-night?\u2019\u2014with a very deep expression. \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll tell you. He\u2019s with old Bounderby. They are having a regular confab together up at the Bank. Why at the Bank, do you think? Well, I\u2019ll tell you again. To keep Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s ears as far off as possible, I expect.\u2019 With her hand upon her brother\u2019s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire. Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him. \u2018You are very fond of me, an\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 \u2018Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me.\u2019 \u2018Well, sister of mine,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018when you say that, you are near my thoughts. We might be so much oftener together\u2014mightn\u2019t we? Always together, almost\u2014mightn\u2019t we? It would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what, Loo. It would be a splendid thing for me. It would be uncommonly jolly!\u2019 Her thoughtfulness baffled his cunning scrutiny. He could make nothing of her face. He pressed her in his arm, and kissed her cheek. She returned the kiss, but still looked at the fire.", " \u2018Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told her! Never knew her do such a thing before. Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!\u2019 She still looked faint and pale. James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed. \u2018Why, I am going to tell you,\u2019 said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you before. You know this lady (for she _is_ a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?\u2019 \u2018I have already had the honour\u2014\u2019 \u2018Very well. And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him too on the same occasion?\u2019 Mr. Harthouse inclined his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead. \u2018Very well. They live at the Bank. You know they live at the Bank, perhaps? Very well. Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything was put away as usual. In the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much. In the little safe in young Tom\u2019s closet, the safe used for petty purposes, there was a hundred and fifty odd pound.\u2019 \u2018A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Come!\u2019 retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him, \u2018let\u2019s have none of _your_ interruptions. It\u2019s enough to be robbed while you\u2019re snoring because you\u2019re too comfortable, without being put right with _your_ four seven ones."], "Which characteris a Member of Parliament?": [" And the honourable member had so tickled the House (which has a delicate sense of humour) by putting the cap on the cow, that it became impatient of any serious reference to the Coroner\u2019s Inquest, and brought the railway off with Cheers and Laughter. Now, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than himself, who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore; and had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad, and found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored there; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored everywhere. To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said one day, \u2018Jem, there\u2019s a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and they want men. I wonder you don\u2019t go in for statistics.\u2019 Jem, rather taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as ready to \u2018go in\u2019 for statistics as for anything else. So, he went in. He coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows, and said, \u2018If you want to bring in, for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech, look after my brother Jem, for he\u2019s your man.\u2019 After a few dashes in the public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to become known there and in the neighbourhood.", " There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms, whether native or foreign, and all about it. The bridesmaids, down to little Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of the company. After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness, I suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and know what I am, and what my extraction was, you won\u2019t expect a speech from a man who, when he sees a Post, says \u201cthat\u2019s a Post,\u201d and when he sees a Pump, says \u201cthat\u2019s a Pump,\u201d and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick. If you want a speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it. I am not your man. However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused.", " In some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric, the processes of Time are very rapid. Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage of their working up, these changes were effected in a year or two; while Mr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his course, and underwent no alteration. Except one, which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill. Time hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery, in a by-comer, and made him Member of Parliament for Coketown: one of the respected members for ounce weights and measures, one of the representatives of the multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable gentlemen, dumb honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame honourable gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to every other consideration. Else wherefore live we in a Christian land, eighteen hundred and odd years after our Master? All this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the grate, and became extinct, that from the period when her father had said she was almost a young woman\u2014which seemed but yesterday\u2014she had scarcely attracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young woman. \u2018Quite a young woman,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, musing. \u2018Dear me!\u2019 Soon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than usual for several days, and seemed much engrossed by one subject.", " Go through with it while you are about it. Out with it.\u2019 \u2018How \u2019tis, ma\u2019am,\u2019 resumed Stephen, appearing still to find his natural refuge in Louisa\u2019s face, \u2018that what is best in us fok, seems to turn us most to trouble an\u2019 misfort\u2019n an\u2019 mistake, I dunno. But \u2019tis so. I know \u2019tis, as I know the heavens is over me ahint the smoke. We\u2019re patient too, an\u2019 wants in general to do right. An\u2019 I canna think the fawt is aw wi\u2019 us.\u2019 \u2018Now, my friend,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, whom he could not have exasperated more, quite unconscious of it though he was, than by seeming to appeal to any one else, \u2018if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute, I should like to have a word or two with you. You said just now, that you had nothing to tell us about this business. You are quite sure of that before we go any further.\u2019 \u2018Sir, I am sure on \u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Here\u2019s a gentleman from London present,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby made a backhanded point at Mr. James Harthouse with his thumb, \u2018a Parliament gentleman. I should like him to hear a short bit of dialogue between you and me, instead of taking the substance of it\u2014for I know precious well, beforehand, what it will be; nobody knows better than I do, take notice!\u2014instead of receiving it on trust from my mouth.\u2019 Stephen bent his head to the gentleman from London, and showed a rather more troubled mind than usual. He turned his eyes involuntarily to his former refuge, but at a look from that quarter (expressive though instantaneous) he settled them on Mr. Bounderby\u2019s face."], "What is Bounderby\u2019sson\u2019s name?": [" Perhaps you\u2019re mistaken, and never wrote any.\u2019 \u2018He hadn\u2019t been gone from here, young lady,\u2019 said Rachael, turning appealingly to Louisa, \u2018as much as a week, when he sent me the only letter I have had from him, saying that he was forced to seek work in another name.\u2019 \u2018Oh, by George!\u2019 cried Bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, \u2018he changes his name, does he! That\u2019s rather unlucky, too, for such an immaculate chap. It\u2019s considered a little suspicious in Courts of Justice, I believe, when an Innocent happens to have many names.\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes again, \u2018what, young lady, in the name of Mercy, was left the poor lad to do! The masters against him on one hand, the men against him on the other, he only wantin to work hard in peace, and do what he felt right. Can a man have no soul of his own, no mind of his own? Must he go wrong all through wi\u2019 this side, or must he go wrong all through wi\u2019 that, or else be hunted like a hare?\u2019 \u2018Indeed, indeed, I pity him from my heart,\u2019 returned Louisa; \u2018and I hope that he will clear himself.\u2019 \u2018You need have no fear of that, young lady. He is sure!\u2019 \u2018All the surer, I suppose,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018for your refusing to tell where he is? Eh?\u2019 \u2018He shall not, through any act of mine, come back wi\u2019 the unmerited reproach of being brought back. He shall come back of his own accord to clear himself, and put all those that have injured his good character, and he not here for its defence, to shame.", " Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too often to believe in them.\u2019 He assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they advanced to meet the whelp. He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along: or he stooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick. He was startled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter pastime, and his colour changed. \u2018Halloa!\u2019 he stammered; \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u2019 \u2018Whose name, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder and turning him, so that they all three walked towards the house together, \u2018have you been carving on the trees?\u2019 \u2018Whose name?\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018Oh! You mean what girl\u2019s name?\u2019 \u2018You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature\u2019s on the bark, Tom.\u2019 [Picture: Mr. Harthouse and Tom Gradgrind in the garden] \u2018Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me. Or she might be as ugly as she was rich, without any fear of losing me. I\u2019d carve her name as often as she liked.\u2019 \u2018I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.\u2019 \u2018Mercenary,\u2019 repeated Tom. \u2018Who is not mercenary? Ask my sister.\u2019 \u2018Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?\u2019 said Louisa, showing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature. \u2018You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,\u2019 returned her brother sulkily. \u2018If it does, you can wear it.\u2019 \u2018Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are now and then,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse.", " I must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points. Will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy\u2019s name?\u2019 \u2018_My_ name?\u2019 said the ambassadress. \u2018The only name I could possibly care to know, to-night.\u2019 \u2018Sissy Jupe.\u2019 \u2018Pardon my curiosity at parting. Related to the family?\u2019 \u2018I am only a poor girl,\u2019 returned Sissy. \u2018I was separated from my father\u2014he was only a stroller\u2014and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind. I have lived in the house ever since.\u2019 She was gone. \u2018It wanted this to complete the defeat,\u2019 said Mr. James Harthouse, sinking, with a resigned air, on the sofa, after standing transfixed a little while. \u2018The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished. Only a poor girl\u2014only a stroller\u2014only James Harthouse made nothing of\u2014only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure.\u2019 The Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the Nile. He took a pen upon the instant, and wrote the following note (in appropriate hieroglyphics) to his brother: Dear Jack,\u2014All up at Coketown. Bored out of the place, and going in for camels. Affectionately, JEM. He rang the bell. \u2018Send my fellow here.\u2019 \u2018Gone to bed, sir.\u2019 \u2018Tell him to get up, and pack up.\u2019 He wrote two more notes. One, to Mr. Bounderby, announcing his retirement from that part of the country, and showing where he would be found for the next fortnight. The other, similar in effect, to Mr. Gradgrind.", " Do you attach no value to their good opinion? What would Mr. Bounderby say?\u2019 At the mention of this name, his daughter stole a look at him, remarkable for its intense and searching character. He saw nothing of it, for before he looked at her, she had again cast down her eyes! \u2018What,\u2019 he repeated presently, \u2018would Mr. Bounderby say?\u2019 All the way to Stone Lodge, as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home, he repeated at intervals \u2018What would Mr. Bounderby say?\u2019\u2014as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy. CHAPTER IV MR. BOUNDERBY NOT being Mrs. Grundy, who _was_ Mr. Bounderby? Why, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s bosom friend, as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment. So near was Mr. Bounderby\u2014or, if the reader should prefer it, so far off. He was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what not. A big, loud man, with a stare, and a metallic laugh. A man made out of a coarse material, which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him. A man with a great puffed head and forehead, swelled veins in his temples, and such a strained skin to his face that it seemed to hold his eyes open, and lift his eyebrows up. A man with a pervading appearance on him of being inflated like a balloon, and ready to start. A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man."], "In which citydoes most of the novel take place?": [" No, by George! I don\u2019t forget that I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. For years upon years, the only pictures in my possession, or that I could have got into my possession, by any means, unless I stole \u2019em, were the engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot, on the blacking bottles that I was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with, and that I sold when they were empty for a farthing a-piece, and glad to get it!\u2019 Then he would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style. \u2018Harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here. Bring half a dozen more if you like, and we\u2019ll find room for \u2019em. There\u2019s stabling in this place for a dozen horses; and unless Nickits is belied, he kept the full number. A round dozen of \u2019em, sir. When that man was a boy, he went to Westminster School. Went to Westminster School as a King\u2019s Scholar, when I was principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market baskets. Why, if I wanted to keep a dozen horses\u2014which I don\u2019t, for one\u2019s enough for me\u2014I couldn\u2019t bear to see \u2019em in their stalls here, and think what my own lodging used to be. I couldn\u2019t look at \u2019em, sir, and not order \u2019em out. Yet so things come round. You see this place; you know what sort of a place it is; you are aware that there\u2019s not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere\u2014I don\u2019t care where\u2014and here, got into the middle of it, like a maggot into a nut, is Josiah Bounderby.", " Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\u2019 She knew by Rachael\u2019s face that she might trust her now. And after standing for a moment to see her running, wringing her hands as she ran, she turned and went upon her own search; she stopped at the hedge to tie her shawl there as a guide to the place, then threw her bonnet aside, and ran as she had never run before. Run, Sissy, run, in Heaven\u2019s name! Don\u2019t stop for breath. Run, run! Quickening herself by carrying such entreaties in her thoughts, she ran from field to field, and lane to lane, and place to place, as she had never run before; until she came to a shed by an engine-house, where two men lay in the shade, asleep on straw. First to wake them, and next to tell them, all so wild and breathless as she was, what had brought her there, were difficulties; but they no sooner understood her than their spirits were on fire like hers. One of the men was in a drunken slumber, but on his comrade\u2019s shouting to him that a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft, he started out to a pool of dirty water, put his head in it, and came back sober. With these two men she ran to another half-a-mile further, and with that one to another, while they ran elsewhere. Then a horse was found; and she got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad, and send a message to Louisa, which she wrote and gave him. By this time a whole village was up: and windlasses, ropes, poles, candles, lanterns, all things necessary, were fast collecting and being brought into one place, to be carried to the Old Hell Shaft.", " He had a particular pride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a special application to him. Whatsoever the public meeting held in Coketown, and whatsoever the subject of such meeting, some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical friend Gradgrind. This always pleased the eminently practical friend. He knew it to be his due, but his due was acceptable. He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which was neither town nor country, and yet was either spoiled, when his ears were invaded by the sound of music. The clashing and banging band attached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up its rest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray. A flag, floating from the summit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was \u2018Sleary\u2019s Horse-riding\u2019 which claimed their suffrages. Sleary himself, a stout modern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture, took the money. Miss Josephine Sleary, as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act. Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to \u2018elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing dog Merrylegs.\u2019 He was also to exhibit \u2018his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head, thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.\u2019 The same Signor Jupe was to \u2018enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.\u2019 Lastly, he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in \u2018the highly novel and laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor\u2019s Journey to Brentford.\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.", " \u2018I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,\u2019 observed his sister. \u2018You have no occasion to go away; but don\u2019t interrupt us for a moment, Tom dear.\u2019 \u2018Oh! very well!\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018Only father has brought old Bounderby home, and I want you to come into the drawing-room. Because if you come, there\u2019s a good chance of old Bounderby\u2019s asking me to dinner; and if you don\u2019t, there\u2019s none.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll come directly.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll wait for you,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018to make sure.\u2019 Sissy resumed in a lower voice. \u2018At last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again, and never did give any satisfaction now, and that he was a shame and disgrace, and I should have done better without him all along. I said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him, and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there. When I had no more left to tell, he put his arms round my neck, and kissed me a great many times. Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used, for the little hurt he had had, and to get it at the best place, which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after kissing me again, he let me go. When I had gone down-stairs, I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet, and looked in at the door, and said, \u201cFather dear, shall I take Merrylegs?\u201d Father shook his head and said, \u201cNo, Sissy, no; take nothing that\u2019s known to be mine, my darling;\u201d and I left him sitting by the fire."], "From what doesMrs. Sparsit imagine Louisa falling?": [" I so far go along with them for a novelty, that _I_\u2019ll have nothing to do with you either.\u2019 Stephen raised his eyes quickly to his face. \u2018You can finish off what you\u2019re at,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, with a meaning nod, \u2018and then go elsewhere.\u2019 \u2018Sir, yo know weel,\u2019 said Stephen expressively, \u2018that if I canna get work wi\u2019 yo, I canna get it elsewheer.\u2019 The reply was, \u2018What I know, I know; and what you know, you know. I have no more to say about it.\u2019 Stephen glanced at Louisa again, but her eyes were raised to his no more; therefore, with a sigh, and saying, barely above his breath, \u2018Heaven help us aw in this world!\u2019 he departed. CHAPTER VI FADING AWAY IT was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby\u2019s house. The shadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him when he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street. Nothing was further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had encountered on his previous visit to the same house, when he heard a step behind him that he knew, and turning, saw her in Rachael\u2019s company. He saw Rachael first, as he had heard her only. \u2018Ah, Rachael, my dear! Missus, thou wi\u2019 her!\u2019 \u2018Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason I must say,\u2019 the old woman returned. \u2018Here I am again, you see.\u2019 \u2018But how wi\u2019 Rachael?\u2019 said Stephen, falling into their step, walking between them, and looking from the one to the other.", " Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was), and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily. So when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day before her departure, \u2018I tell you what, ma\u2019am; you shall come down here of a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.\u2019 To which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan persuasion: \u2018To hear is to obey.\u2019 Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy, into her head. Much watching of Louisa, and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s edge, must have given her as it were a lift, in the way of inspiration. She erected in her mind a mighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa coming. It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s life, to look up at her staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.", " She made him her stately curtsey in the garden, one morning before breakfast. \u2018It appears but yesterday, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that I had the honour of receiving you at the Bank, when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby\u2019s address.\u2019 \u2018An occasion, I am sure, not to be forgotten by myself in the course of Ages,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse, inclining his head to Mrs. Sparsit with the most indolent of all possible airs. \u2018We live in a singular world, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018I have had the honour, by a coincidence of which I am proud, to have made a remark, similar in effect, though not so epigrammatically expressed.\u2019 \u2018A singular world, I would say, sir,\u2019 pursued Mrs. Sparsit; after acknowledging the compliment with a drooping of her dark eyebrows, not altogether so mild in its expression as her voice was in its dulcet tones; \u2018as regards the intimacies we form at one time, with individuals we were quite ignorant of, at another. I recall, sir, that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of Miss Gradgrind.\u2019 \u2018Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves. I availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity, and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate. Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s talent for\u2014in fact for anything requiring accuracy\u2014with a combination of strength of mind\u2014and Family\u2014is too habitually developed to admit of any question.\u2019 He was almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took him so long to get through, and his mind wandered so much in the course of its execution.", " I hope I shall be.\u2019 \u2018_Do_ you, sir!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with great affability. \u2018But naturally you do; of course you do.\u2019 A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby\u2019s part, succeeded. Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough, which sounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance. \u2018Well, ma\u2019am,\u2019 resumed Bounderby, \u2018under these circumstances, I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here, though you would be very welcome here.\u2019 \u2018Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit shook her head, still in her highly superior manner, and a little changed the small cough\u2014coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her, but had better be coughed down. \u2018However, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018there are apartments at the Bank, where a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a catch than otherwise; and if the same terms\u2014\u2019 \u2018I beg your pardon, sir. You were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase, annual compliment.\u2019 \u2018Well, ma\u2019am, annual compliment. If the same annual compliment would be acceptable there, why, I see nothing to part us, unless you do.\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018The proposal is like yourself, and if the position I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale\u2014\u2019 \u2018Why, of course it is,\u2019 said Bounderby."], "Who is the firstcharacter to speak in the novel?": [" He had a particular pride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a special application to him.

I belong to the Bank; so, if you go straight up without me (I was sent to fetch you), you\u2019ll save me a walk.\u2019 Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby. CHAPTER V MEN AND MASTERS \u2018WELL, Stephen,\u2019 said Bounderby, in his windy manner, \u2018what\u2019s this I hear? What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_? Come in, and speak up.\u2019 It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden. A tea-table was set out; and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s young wife, and her brother, and a great gentleman from London, were present. To whom Stephen made his obeisance, closing the door and standing near it, with his hat in his hand. \u2018This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. The gentleman he addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa, got up, saying in an indolent way, \u2018Oh really?\u2019 and dawdled to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood. \u2018Now,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018speak up!\u2019 After the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and discordantly on Stephen\u2019s ear. Besides being a rough handling of his wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested deserter he had been called. \u2018What were it, sir,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018as yo were pleased to want wi\u2019 me?\u2019 \u2018Why, I have told you,\u2019 returned Bounderby.", " You\u2019re wanted, sir, if you please.\u2019 A general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to the swell mob, caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return, with bristling indignation, what the Devil he meant by \u2018wanted\u2019? \u2018Beg your pardon, sir. Young lady outside, sir, wishes to see you.\u2019 \u2018Outside? Where?\u2019 \u2018Outside this door, sir.\u2019 Giving the waiter to the personage before mentioned, as a block-head duly qualified for that consignment, Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery. A young woman whom he had never seen stood there. Plainly dressed, very quiet, very pretty. As he conducted her into the room and placed a chair for her, he observed, by the light of the candles, that she was even prettier than he had at first believed. Her face was innocent and youthful, and its expression remarkably pleasant. She was not afraid of him, or in any way disconcerted; she seemed to have her mind entirely preoccupied with the occasion of her visit, and to have substituted that consideration for herself. \u2018I speak to Mr. Harthouse?\u2019 she said, when they were alone. \u2018To Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 He added in his mind, \u2018And you speak to him with the most confiding eyes I ever saw, and the most earnest voice (though so quiet) I ever heard.\u2019 \u2018If I do not understand\u2014and I do not, sir\u2019\u2014said Sissy, \u2018what your honour as a gentleman binds you to, in other matters:\u2019 the blood really rose in his face as she began in these words: \u2018I am sure I may rely upon it to keep my visit secret, and to keep secret what I am going to say.", " Oh, you Englishmen, I ask you how does this subornation show in one of yourselves, who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours, and to your children\u2019s and your children\u2019s children\u2019s?\u2019 There was some applause, and some crying of Shame upon the man; but the greater part of the audience were quiet. They looked at Stephen\u2019s worn face, rendered more pathetic by the homely emotions it evinced; and, in the kindness of their nature, they were more sorry than indignant. \u2018\u2019Tis this Delegate\u2019s trade for t\u2019 speak,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018an\u2019 he\u2019s paid for \u2019t, an\u2019 he knows his work. Let him keep to \u2019t. Let him give no heed to what I ha had\u2019n to bear. That\u2019s not for him. That\u2019s not for nobbody but me.\u2019 There was a propriety, not to say a dignity in these words, that made the hearers yet more quiet and attentive. The same strong voice called out, \u2018Slackbridge, let the man be heern, and howd thee tongue!\u2019 Then the place was wonderfully still. \u2018My brothers,\u2019 said Stephen, whose low voice was distinctly heard, \u2018and my fellow-workmen\u2014for that yo are to me, though not, as I knows on, to this delegate here\u2014I ha but a word to sen, and I could sen nommore if I was to speak till Strike o\u2019 day. I know weel, aw what\u2019s afore me. I know weel that yo aw resolve to ha nommore ado wi\u2019 a man who is not wi\u2019 yo in this matther. I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i\u2019 th\u2019 road, yo\u2019d feel it right to pass me by, as a forrenner and stranger."], "Why is Stephenunable to marry Rachael?": [" For the misplaced expression?\u2019 \u2018Louisa,\u2019 returned her father, \u2018it appears to me that nothing can be plainer. Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him? Yes, he does. The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him? I think nothing can be plainer than that?\u2019 \u2018Shall I marry him?\u2019 repeated Louisa, with great deliberation. \u2018Precisely. And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear Louisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that belong to many young women.\u2019 \u2018No, father,\u2019 she returned, \u2018I do not.\u2019 \u2018I now leave you to judge for yourself,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018I have stated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds; I have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time. The rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to decide.\u2019 From the beginning, she had sat looking at him fixedly. As he now leaned back in his chair, and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn, perhaps he might have seen one wavering moment in her, when she was impelled to throw herself upon his breast, and give him the pent-up confidences of her heart. But, to see it, he must have overleaped at a bound the artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting, between himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will elude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be sounded shall blow even algebra to wreck.", " \u2018I misdoubt,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018if there is as many as twenty left in all this place, who have any trust in the poor dear lad now.\u2019 She said it to Sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted only by the lamp at the street corner. Sissy had come there when it was already dark, to await her return from work; and they had since sat at the window where Rachael had found her, wanting no brighter light to shine on their sorrowful talk. \u2018If it hadn\u2019t been mercifully brought about, that I was to have you to speak to,\u2019 pursued Rachael, \u2018times are, when I think my mind would not have kept right. But I get hope and strength through you; and you believe that though appearances may rise against him, he will be proved clear?\u2019 \u2018I do believe so,\u2019 returned Sissy, \u2018with my whole heart. I feel so certain, Rachael, that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him than if I had known him through as many years of trial as you have.\u2019 \u2018And I, my dear,\u2019 said Rachel, with a tremble in her voice, \u2018have known him through them all, to be, according to his quiet ways, so faithful to everything honest and good, that if he was never to be heard of more, and I was to live to be a hundred years old, I could say with my last breath, God knows my heart. I have never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool!\u2019 \u2018We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he will be freed from suspicion, sooner or later.\u2019 \u2018The better I know it to be so believed there, my dear,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018and the kinder I feel it that you come away from there, purposely to comfort me, and keep me company, and be seen wi\u2019 me when I am not yet free from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.", " With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in her old age. \u2018Well, missus,\u2019 said he, \u2018I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom. Wi\u2019 fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha never seen the like on.\u2019 \u2018Young and handsome. Yes!\u2019 cried the old woman, quite delighted. \u2018As bonny as a rose! And what a happy wife!\u2019 \u2018Aye, missus, I suppose she be,\u2019 said Stephen. But with a doubtful glance at Rachael. \u2018Suppose she be? She must be. She\u2019s your master\u2019s wife,\u2019 returned the old woman. Stephen nodded assent. \u2018Though as to master,\u2019 said he, glancing again at Rachael, \u2018not master onny more. That\u2019s aw enden \u2019twixt him and me.\u2019 \u2018Have you left his work, Stephen?\u2019 asked Rachael, anxiously and quickly. \u2018Why, Rachael,\u2019 he replied, \u2018whether I ha lef\u2019n his work, or whether his work ha lef\u2019n me, cooms t\u2019 th\u2019 same. His work and me are parted. \u2019Tis as weel so\u2014better, I were thinkin when yo coom up wi\u2019 me. It would ha brought\u2019n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer. Haply \u2019tis a kindness to monny that I go; haply \u2019tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it mun be done. I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th\u2019 time, and seek a fort\u2019n, dear, by beginnin fresh.\u2019 \u2018Where will you go, Stephen?\u2019 \u2018I donno t\u2019night,\u2019 said he, lifting off his hat, and smoothing his thin hair with the flat of his hand. \u2018But I\u2019m not goin t\u2019night, Rachael, nor yet t\u2019morrow.", " She got up to look at it. \u2018And yet I don\u2019t know. This has not been broken very long. The wood is quite fresh where it gave way. Here are footsteps too.\u2014O Rachael!\u2019 She ran back, and caught her round the neck. Rachael had already started up. \u2018What is the matter?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. There is a hat lying in the grass.\u2019 They went forward together. Rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot. She broke into a passion of tears and lamentations: Stephen Blackpool was written in his own hand on the inside. \u2018O the poor lad, the poor lad! He has been made away with. He is lying murdered here!\u2019 \u2018Is there\u2014has the hat any blood upon it?\u2019 Sissy faltered. They were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of violence, inside or out. It had been lying there some days, for rain and dew had stained it, and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it had fallen. They looked fearfully about them, without moving, but could see nothing more. \u2018Rachael,\u2019 Sissy whispered, \u2018I will go on a little by myself.\u2019 She had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when Rachael caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the wide landscape. Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass. They sprang back, and fell upon their knees, each hiding her face upon the other\u2019s neck. \u2018O, my good Lord! He\u2019s down there! Down there!\u2019 At first this, and her terrific screams, were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears, by any prayers, by any representations, by any means."], "How do the poorof Coketown attempt to improve their conditions?": [" But, since you do refer to me, now look at me, ma\u2019am. I have put by a little, ma\u2019am, already. That gratuity which I receive at Christmas, ma\u2019am: I never touch it. I don\u2019t even go the length of my wages, though they\u2019re not high, ma\u2019am. Why can\u2019t they do as I have done, ma\u2019am? What one person can do, another can do.\u2019 This, again, was among the fictions of Coketown. Any capitalist there, who had made sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, always professed to wonder why the sixty thousand nearest Hands didn\u2019t each make sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, and more or less reproached them every one for not accomplishing the little feat. What I did you can do. Why don\u2019t you go and do it? \u2018As to their wanting recreations, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, \u2018it\u2019s stuff and nonsense. _I_ don\u2019t want recreations. I never did, and I never shall; I don\u2019t like \u2019em. As to their combining together; there are many of them, I have no doubt, that by watching and informing upon one another could earn a trifle now and then, whether in money or good will, and improve their livelihood. Then, why don\u2019t they improve it, ma\u2019am! It\u2019s the first consideration of a rational creature, and it\u2019s what they pretend to want.\u2019 \u2018Pretend indeed!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma\u2019am, till it becomes quite nauseous, concerning their wives and families,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Why look at me, ma\u2019am! I don\u2019t want a wife and family.", " Bounderby, I assure you I am entirely and completely of your way of thinking. On conviction.\u2019 \u2018I am glad to hear it,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018Now, you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills, no doubt. You have? Very good. I\u2019ll state the fact of it to you. It\u2019s the pleasantest work there is, and it\u2019s the lightest work there is, and it\u2019s the best-paid work there is. More than that, we couldn\u2019t improve the mills themselves, unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors. Which we\u2019re not a-going to do.\u2019 \u2018Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.\u2019 \u2018Lastly,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018as to our Hands. There\u2019s not a Hand in this town, sir, man, woman, or child, but has one ultimate object in life. That object is, to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon. Now, they\u2019re not a-going\u2014none of \u2019em\u2014ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon. And now you know the place.\u2019 Mr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and refreshed, by this condensed epitome of the whole Coketown question. \u2018Why, you see,\u2019 replied Mr. Bounderby, \u2018it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man, particularly with a public man, when I make his acquaintance. I have only one thing more to say to you, Mr. Harthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall respond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend Tom Gradgrind\u2019s letter of introduction.", " \u2018She kept a chandler\u2019s shop,\u2019 pursued Bounderby, \u2018and kept me in an egg-box. That was the cot of _my_ infancy; an old egg-box. As soon as I was big enough to run away, of course I ran away. Then I became a young vagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me, everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me. They were right; they had no business to do anything else. I was a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest. I know that very well.\u2019 His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast. \u2018I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind. Whether I was to do it or not, ma\u2019am, I did it. I pulled through it, though nobody threw me out a rope. Vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk, chief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Those are the antecedents, and the culmination. Josiah Bounderby of Coketown learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the steeple clock of St. Giles\u2019s Church, London, under the direction of a drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant. Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of your district schools and your model schools, and your training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish of schools; and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, tells you plainly, all right, all correct\u2014he hadn\u2019t such advantages\u2014but let us have hard-headed, solid-fisted people\u2014the education that made him won\u2019t do for everybody, he knows well\u2014such and such his education was, however, and you may force him to swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress the facts of his life.\u2019 Being heated when he arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown stopped.", " \u2018Time\u2019s up. Good-bye! I shall be on the look-out for you, when you come back. I say, my dear Loo! AN\u2019T it uncommonly jolly now!\u2019 * * * * * END OF THE FIRST BOOK BOOK THE SECOND _REAPING_ CHAPTER I EFFECTS IN THE BANK A SUNNY midsummer day. There was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown. Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun\u2019s rays. You only knew the town was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town. A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell, or changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:\u2014Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be seen. The wonder was, it was there at all. It had been ruined so often, that it was amazing how it had borne so many shocks. Surely there never was such fragile china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were made. Handle them never so lightly, and they fell to pieces with such ease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before. They were ruined, when they were required to send labouring children to school; they were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works; they were ruined, when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery; they were utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not always make quite so much smoke."], "What is the nameof Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s aristocratic relative?": [" \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward. So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table.", " Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness. When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped. When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on. She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad. A train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination. In Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were necessary to change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee of the station wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on over her bonnet. So disguised she had no fear of being recognized when she followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small office. Louisa sat waiting in a corner. Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in another corner. Both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the rain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the parapets of the arches. Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw the lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron tracks. The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart, announced the train. Fire and steam, and smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; Louisa put into one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little station a desert speck in the thunderstorm.", " \u2018Merely going on in the old way, ma\u2019am. Uniting, and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one another.\u2019 \u2018It is much to be regretted,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity, \u2018that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018They have done that, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer; \u2018but it rather fell through, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018I do not pretend to understand these things,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with dignity, \u2018my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere; and Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions. I only know that these people must be conquered, and that it\u2019s high time it was done, once for all.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s oracular authority. \u2018You couldn\u2019t put it clearer, I am sure, ma\u2019am.\u2019 As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street. \u2018Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit.", " But you shall say no more, sir. I will go, upon your invitation.\u2019 \u2018Why, when I invite you to my house, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, opening his eyes, \u2018I should hope you want no other invitation.\u2019 \u2018No, indeed, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I should hope not. Say no more, sir. I would, sir, I could see you gay again.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean, ma\u2019am?\u2019 blustered Bounderby. \u2018Sir,\u2019 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018there was wont to be an elasticity in you which I sadly miss. Be buoyant, sir!\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning. \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on his journey, and the Bank was closing, \u2018present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?\u2019 Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and followed on its heels. \u2018Mr. Thomas,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018these plain viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\u2019 \u2018Thank\u2019ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\u2019 said the whelp. And gloomily fell to. \u2018How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Where may he be at present?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative."], "What does Gradgrindhope Tom will be able to do after Stephen\u2019s death?": [" \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you\u2019ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I\u2019ll mention it. Never mind a light, man!\u2019 Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. \u2018It don\u2019t want a light.\u2019 Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand. \u2018I say!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I think I can do you a good turn. Don\u2019t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there\u2019s no harm in my trying.\u2019 His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\u2019s ear, it was so hot. \u2018That was our light porter at the Bank,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018who brought you the message to-night. I call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.\u2019 Stephen thought, \u2018What a hurry he is in!\u2019 He spoke so confusedly. \u2018Well!\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! When are you off?\u2019 \u2018T\u2019 day\u2019s Monday,\u2019 replied Stephen, considering. \u2018Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh \u2019bout.\u2019 \u2018Friday or Saturday,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you\u2014that\u2019s my sister, you know, in your room\u2014but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there\u2019s no harm done. So I tell you what. You\u2019ll know our light porter again?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sure,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Very well,\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018When you leave work of a night, between this and your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?", " \u2018No, she does not, Tom, I am sure!\u2019 \u2018She must,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018She must just hate and detest the whole set-out of us. They\u2019ll bother her head off, I think, before they have done with her. Already she\u2019s getting as pale as wax, and as heavy as\u2014I am.\u2019 Young Thomas expressed these sentiments sitting astride of a chair before the fire, with his arms on the back, and his sulky face on his arms. His sister sat in the darker corner by the fireside, now looking at him, now looking at the bright sparks as they dropped upon the hearth. \u2018As to me,\u2019 said Tom, tumbling his hair all manner of ways with his sulky hands, \u2018I am a Donkey, that\u2019s what _I_ am. I am as obstinate as one, I am more stupid than one, I get as much pleasure as one, and I should like to kick like one.\u2019 \u2018Not me, I hope, Tom?\u2019 \u2018No, Loo; I wouldn\u2019t hurt _you_. I made an exception of you at first. I don\u2019t know what this\u2014jolly old\u2014Jaundiced Jail,\u2019 Tom had paused to find a sufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof, and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of this one, \u2018would be without you.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, Tom? Do you really and truly say so?\u2019 \u2018Why, of course I do. What\u2019s the use of talking about it!\u2019 returned Tom, chafing his face on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison with his spirit. \u2018Because, Tom,\u2019 said his sister, after silently watching the sparks awhile, \u2018as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can\u2019t reconcile you to home better than I am able to do.", " Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer. \u2018A very good fellow indeed!\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018You think so, don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Tom. And shut up his eye again. Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: \u2018What a comical brother-in-law you are!\u2019 \u2018What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\u2019 retorted Mr. James Harthouse. There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. \u2018Oh! I don\u2019t care for old Bounderby,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you mean that.", " I am looking at the fire.\u2019 \u2018You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Another of the advantages, I suppose, of being a girl.\u2019 \u2018Tom,\u2019 enquired his sister, slowly, and in a curious tone, as if she were reading what she asked in the fire, and it was not quite plainly written there, \u2018do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr. Bounderby\u2019s?\u2019 \u2018Why, there\u2019s one thing to be said of it,\u2019 returned Tom, pushing his chair from him, and standing up; \u2018it will be getting away from home.\u2019 \u2018There is one thing to be said of it,\u2019 Louisa repeated in her former curious tone; \u2018it will be getting away from home. Yes.\u2019 \u2018Not but what I shall be very unwilling, both to leave you, Loo, and to leave you here. But I must go, you know, whether I like it or not; and I had better go where I can take with me some advantage of your influence, than where I should lose it altogether. Don\u2019t you see?\u2019 \u2018Yes, Tom.\u2019 The answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it, that Tom went and leaned on the back of her chair, to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her, from her point of view, and see what he could make of it. \u2018Except that it is a fire,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks. What do you see in it? Not a circus?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t see anything in it, Tom, particularly. But since I have been looking at it, I have been wondering about you and me, grown up.\u2019 \u2018Wondering again!\u2019 said Tom."], "What is Bitzer\u2019sdefining characteristic?": [" \u2018No, Bitzer,\u2019 continued Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018say an individual, and I will hear you; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.\u2019 \u2018With the usual exception, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, trying back, \u2018of an individual.\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head over her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been interrupted. \u2018An individual, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, \u2018has never been what he ought to have been, since he first came into the place. He is a dissipated, extravagant idler. He is not worth his salt, ma\u2019am. He wouldn\u2019t get it either, if he hadn\u2019t a friend and relation at court, ma\u2019am!\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her head. \u2018I only hope, ma\u2019am,\u2019 pursued Bitzer, \u2018that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on. Otherwise, ma\u2019am, we know out of whose pocket _that_ money comes.\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her head. \u2018He is to be pitied, ma\u2019am. The last party I have alluded to, is to be pitied, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Yes, Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018I have always pitied the delusion, always.\u2019 \u2018As to an individual, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, dropping his voice and drawing nearer, \u2018he is as improvident as any of the people in this town. And you know what _their_ improvidence is, ma\u2019am. No one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does.\u2019 \u2018They would do well,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018to take example by you, Bitzer.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am.", " \u2018Merely going on in the old way, ma\u2019am. Uniting, and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one another.\u2019 \u2018It is much to be regretted,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity, \u2018that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018They have done that, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer; \u2018but it rather fell through, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018I do not pretend to understand these things,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with dignity, \u2018my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere; and Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions. I only know that these people must be conquered, and that it\u2019s high time it was done, once for all.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s oracular authority. \u2018You couldn\u2019t put it clearer, I am sure, ma\u2019am.\u2019 As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street. \u2018Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit.", " Why should they?\u2019 \u2018Because they are improvident,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018that\u2019s where it is. If they were more provident and less perverse, ma\u2019am, what would they do? They would say, \u201cWhile my hat covers my family,\u201d or \u201cwhile my bonnet covers my family,\u201d\u2014as the case might be, ma\u2019am\u2014\u201cI have only one to feed, and that\u2019s the person I most like to feed.\u201d\u2019 \u2018To be sure,\u2019 assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin. \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s improving conversation. \u2018Would you wish a little more hot water, ma\u2019am, or is there anything else that I could fetch you?\u2019 \u2018Nothing just now, Bitzer.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am. I shouldn\u2019t wish to disturb you at your meals, ma\u2019am, particularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,\u2019 said Bitzer, craning a little to look over into the street from where he stood; \u2018but there\u2019s a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, ma\u2019am, and he has come across as if he was going to knock. That _is_ his knock, ma\u2019am, no doubt.\u2019 He stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again, confirmed himself with, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am. Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in, ma\u2019am?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know who it can be,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping her mouth and arranging her mittens. \u2018A stranger, ma\u2019am, evidently.\u2019 \u2018What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless he comes upon some business for which he is too late, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr. Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it.", " There he stood, panting and heaving, as if he had never stopped since the night, now long ago, when he had run them down before. \u2018I\u2019m sorry to interfere with your plans,\u2019 said Bitzer, shaking his head, \u2018but I can\u2019t allow myself to be done by horse-riders. I must have young Mr. Tom; he mustn\u2019t be got away by horse-riders; here he is in a smock frock, and I must have him!\u2019 By the collar, too, it seemed. For, so he took possession of him. CHAPTER VIII PHILOSOPHICAL THEY went back into the booth, Sleary shutting the door to keep intruders out. Bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in the Ring, blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the twilight. \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to him, \u2018have you a heart?\u2019 \u2018The circulation, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the question, \u2018couldn\u2019t be carried on without one. No man, sir, acquainted with the facts established by Harvey relating to the circulation of the blood, can doubt that I have a heart.\u2019 \u2018Is it accessible,\u2019 cried Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018to any compassionate influence?\u2019 \u2018It is accessible to Reason, sir,\u2019 returned the excellent young man. \u2018And to nothing else.\u2019 They stood looking at each other; Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s face as white as the pursuer\u2019s. \u2018What motive\u2014even what motive in reason\u2014can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018and crushing his miserable father?"], "Where does Louisaflee after Harthouse\u2019s declaration of love?": [" Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the shocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to which it has led. Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive you as I do!\u2019 The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone. But, when Louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh. \u2018Not you. I don\u2019t want to have anything to say to you!\u2019 \u2018O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!\u2019 \u2018After all your love!\u2019 he returned, obdurately. \u2018Pretty love! Leaving old Bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and going home just when I was in the greatest danger. Pretty love that! Coming out with every word about our having gone to that place, when you saw the net was gathering round me. Pretty love that! You have regularly given me up. You never cared for me.\u2019 \u2018Tharp\u2019th the word!\u2019 said Sleary, at the door. They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she forgave him, and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one ran against them. Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both before him while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled. For, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when other people ran themselves into a glow.", " \u2018What is the present need, Tom? Three figures? Out with them. Say what they are.\u2019 \u2018Mr. Harthouse,\u2019 returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were better than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: \u2018it\u2019s too late; the money is of no use to me at present. I should have had it before to be of use to me. But I am very much obliged to you; you\u2019re a true friend.\u2019 A true friend! \u2018Whelp, whelp!\u2019 thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; \u2018what an Ass you are!\u2019 \u2018And I take your offer as a great kindness,\u2019 said Tom, grasping his hand. \u2018As a great kindness, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 returned the other, \u2018it may be of more use by and by. And, my good fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds. \u2018I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Now, you see, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing over a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland: \u2018every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the rest of my fellow-creatures. I am desperately intent;\u2019 the languor of his desperation being quite tropical; \u2018on your softening towards your sister\u2014which you ought to do; and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother\u2014which you ought to be.\u2019 \u2018I will be, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018No time like the present, Tom.", " Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand; superscribed, \u2018Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown. Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire. Thomas Gradgrind.\u2019 Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse\u2019s card, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel. There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to \u2018go in\u2019 for something else. \u2018My name, sir,\u2019 said his visitor, \u2018is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure he had long expected. \u2018Coketown, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, \u2018is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to. Therefore, if you will allow me\u2014or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man\u2014I\u2019ll tell you something about it before we go any further.\u2019 Mr. Harthouse would be charmed. \u2018Don\u2019t be too sure of that,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I don\u2019t promise it. First of all, you see our smoke. That\u2019s meat and drink to us. It\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the lungs. If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from you. We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear \u2019em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland.\u2019 By way of \u2018going in\u2019 to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, \u2018Mr.", " \u2018My dearest love,\u2019 said he, \u2018what could I do? Knowing you were alone, was it possible that I could stay away?\u2019 \u2018You may hang your head, to make yourself the more attractive; _I_ don\u2019t know what they see in you when you hold it up,\u2019 thought Mrs. Sparsit; \u2018but you little think, my dearest love, whose eyes are on you!\u2019 That she hung her head, was certain. She urged him to go away, she commanded him to go away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor raised it. Yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her life. Her hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her manner of speaking was not hurried. \u2018My dear child,\u2019 said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his arm embraced her; \u2018will you not bear with my society for a little while?\u2019 \u2018Not here.\u2019 \u2018Where, Louisa? \u2018Not here.\u2019 \u2018But we have so little time to make so much of, and I have come so far, and am altogether so devoted, and distracted. There never was a slave at once so devoted and ill-used by his mistress. To look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life, and to be received in your frozen manner, is heart-rending.\u2019 \u2018Am I to say again, that I must be left to myself here?\u2019 \u2018But we must meet, my dear Louisa. Where shall we meet?\u2019 They both started. The listener started, guiltily, too; for she thought there was another listener among the trees."], "What are Sissy\u2019sfather\u2019s first words after he returns to his daughter?": [" All that is difficult to me now, would be so easy then.\u2019 \u2018You might not be the better for it, Sissy.\u2019 Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, \u2018I should not be the worse, Miss Louisa.\u2019 To which Miss Louisa answered, \u2018I don\u2019t know that.\u2019 There had been so little communication between these two\u2014both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition relative to Sissy\u2019s past career\u2014that they were still almost strangers. Sissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa\u2019s face, was uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent. \u2018You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than I can ever be,\u2019 Louisa resumed. \u2018You are pleasanter to yourself, than _I_ am to _my_self.\u2019 \u2018But, if you please, Miss Louisa,\u2019 Sissy pleaded, \u2018I am\u2014O so stupid!\u2019 Louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would be wiser by-and-by. \u2018You don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Sissy, half crying, \u2018what a stupid girl I am. All through school hours I make mistakes. Mr. and Mrs. M\u2019Choakumchild call me up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes. I can\u2019t help them. They seem to come natural to me.\u2019 \u2018Mr. and Mrs. M\u2019Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018O no!\u2019 she eagerly returned. \u2018They know everything.\u2019 \u2018Tell me some of your mistakes.\u2019 \u2018I am almost ashamed,\u2019 said Sissy, with reluctance.", " He would then know what he would have to explain on coming back, and would be ready.\u2019 \u2018Yes, dear,\u2019 she returned; \u2018but I can\u2019t guess what can have ever taken him there. He never used to go there. It was never in his way. His way was the same as mine, and not near it.\u2019 Sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of him. \u2018I doubt,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018if he can be here till next day.\u2019 \u2018Then I will come next night too,\u2019 said Sissy. When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his head, and said to his daughter: \u2018Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man. Do you believe him to be implicated?\u2019 \u2018I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty. I do not believe it now.\u2019 \u2018That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing him to be suspected. His appearance and manner; are they so honest?\u2019 \u2018Very honest.\u2019 \u2018And her confidence not to be shaken! I ask myself,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, musing, \u2018does the real culprit know of these accusations? Where is he? Who is he?\u2019 His hair had latterly began to change its colour. As he leaned upon his hand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side. Her eyes by accident met Sissy\u2019s at the moment. Sissy flushed and started, and Louisa put her finger on her lip.", " In such terms, no doubt, substituting the words \u2018boys and girls,\u2019 for \u2018sir,\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers before him, who were to be filled so full of facts. Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one discharge. He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away. \u2018Girl number twenty,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his square forefinger, \u2018I don\u2019t know that girl. Who is that girl?\u2019 \u2018Sissy Jupe, sir,\u2019 explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and curtseying. \u2018Sissy is not a name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Don\u2019t call yourself Sissy. Call yourself Cecilia.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s father as calls me Sissy, sir,\u2019 returned the young girl in a trembling voice, and with another curtsey. \u2018Then he has no business to do it,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Tell him he mustn\u2019t. Cecilia Jupe. Let me see. What is your father?\u2019 \u2018He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his hand. \u2018We don\u2019t want to know anything about that, here. You mustn\u2019t tell us about that, here. Your father breaks horses, don\u2019t he?\u2019 \u2018If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses in the ring, sir.\u2019 \u2018You mustn\u2019t tell us about the ring, here.", " And that was wrong, too.\u2019 \u2018Of course it was.\u2019 \u2018Then Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said he would try me once more. And he said, Here are the stutterings\u2014\u2019 \u2018Statistics,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Yes, Miss Louisa\u2014they always remind me of stutterings, and that\u2019s another of my mistakes\u2014of accidents upon the sea. And I find (Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death. What is the percentage? And I said, Miss;\u2019 here Sissy fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest error; \u2018I said it was nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Miss\u2014to the relations and friends of the people who were killed. I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed."], "What motivatesHarthouse to become one of Gradgrind\u2019s political disciples?": [" They went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits more hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for anything? Moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were attractive to many of the Gradgrind school. They liked fine gentlemen; they pretended that they did not, but they did. They became exhausted in imitation of them; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like them; and they served out, with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political economy, on which they regaled their disciples. There never before was seen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced. Among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the Gradgrind school, there was one of a good family and a better appearance, with a happy turn of humour which had told immensely with the House of Commons on the occasion of his entertaining it with his (and the Board of Directors) view of a railway accident, in which the most careful officers ever known, employed by the most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by the finest mechanical contrivances ever devised, the whole in action on the best line ever constructed, had killed five people and wounded thirty-two, by a casualty without which the excellence of the whole system would have been positively incomplete. Among the slain was a cow, and among the scattered articles unowned, a widow\u2019s cap.", " And the honourable member had so tickled the House (which has a delicate sense of humour) by putting the cap on the cow, that it became impatient of any serious reference to the Coroner\u2019s Inquest, and brought the railway off with Cheers and Laughter. Now, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than himself, who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore; and had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad, and found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored there; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored everywhere. To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said one day, \u2018Jem, there\u2019s a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and they want men. I wonder you don\u2019t go in for statistics.\u2019 Jem, rather taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as ready to \u2018go in\u2019 for statistics as for anything else. So, he went in. He coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows, and said, \u2018If you want to bring in, for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech, look after my brother Jem, for he\u2019s your man.\u2019 After a few dashes in the public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to become known there and in the neighbourhood.", " \u2018This, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind\u2019s eldest daughter. Loo, Mr. James Harthouse. Mr. Harthouse has joined your father\u2019s muster-roll. If he is not Tom Gradgrind\u2019s colleague before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns. You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior. I don\u2019t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw something in me, I suppose, or she wouldn\u2019t have married me. She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise. If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby.\u2019 To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to learn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended. \u2018Come!\u2019 said his host. \u2018If you\u2019re in the complimentary line, you\u2019ll get on here, for you\u2019ll meet with no competition. I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I don\u2019t profess to understand the art of paying \u2019em. In fact, despise \u2019em. But, your bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real thing, by George! You\u2019re a gentleman, and I don\u2019t pretend to be one. I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, and that\u2019s enough for me. However, though I am not influenced by manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be. She hadn\u2019t my advantages\u2014disadvantages you would call \u2019em, but I call \u2019em advantages\u2014so you\u2019ll not waste your power, I dare say.\u2019 \u2018Mr.", " I\u2019ll give _you_ to understand, in reply to that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude\u2014to be summed up in this\u2014that your daughter don\u2019t properly know her husband\u2019s merits, and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her, by George! of the honour of his alliance. That\u2019s plain speaking, I hope.\u2019 \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 urged Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018this is unreasonable.\u2019 \u2018Is it?\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I am glad to hear you say so. Because when Tom Gradgrind, with his new lights, tells me that what I say is unreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible. With your permission I am going on. You know my origin; and you know that for a good many years of my life I didn\u2019t want a shoeing-horn, in consequence of not having a shoe. Yet you may believe or not, as you think proper, that there are ladies\u2014born ladies\u2014belonging to families\u2014Families!\u2014who next to worship the ground I walk on.\u2019 He discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law\u2019s head. \u2018Whereas your daughter,\u2019 proceeded Bounderby, \u2018is far from being a born lady. That you know, yourself. Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff about such things, for you are very well aware I don\u2019t; but that such is the fact, and you, Tom Gradgrind, can\u2019t change it. Why do I say this?\u2019 \u2018Not, I fear,\u2019 observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low voice, \u2018to spare me.\u2019 \u2018Hear me out,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round."], "Where is the novel set?": [" He had a particular pride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a special application to him. Whatsoever the public meeting held in Coketown, and whatsoever the subject of such meeting, some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical friend Gradgrind. This always pleased the eminently practical friend. He knew it to be his due, but his due was acceptable. He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which was neither town nor country, and yet was either spoiled, when his ears were invaded by the sound of music. The clashing and banging band attached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up its rest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray. A flag, floating from the summit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was \u2018Sleary\u2019s Horse-riding\u2019 which claimed their suffrages. Sleary himself, a stout modern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture, took the money. Miss Josephine Sleary, as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act. Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to \u2018elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing dog Merrylegs.\u2019 He was also to exhibit \u2018his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head, thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.\u2019 The same Signor Jupe was to \u2018enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.\u2019 Lastly, he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in \u2018the highly novel and laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor\u2019s Journey to Brentford.\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.", " Bounderby,\u2019 said Jem, turning with a smile to Louisa, \u2018is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works.\u2019 \u2018You respect Mr. Bounderby very much,\u2019 she quietly returned. \u2018It is natural that you should.\u2019 He was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen so much of the world, and thought, \u2018Now, how am I to take this?\u2019 \u2018You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby has said, to the service of your country. You have made up your mind,\u2019 said Louisa, still standing before him where she had first stopped\u2014in all the singular contrariety of her self-possession, and her being obviously very ill at ease\u2014\u2018to show the nation the way out of all its difficulties.\u2019 \u2018Mrs. Bounderby,\u2019 he returned, laughing, \u2018upon my honour, no. I will make no such pretence to you. I have seen a little, here and there, up and down; I have found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and as some confess they have, and some do not; and I am going in for your respected father\u2019s opinions\u2014really because I have no choice of opinions, and may as well back them as anything else.\u2019 \u2018Have you none of your own?\u2019 asked Louisa. \u2018I have not so much as the slightest predilection left. I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions. The result of the varieties of boredom I have undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the subject), that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set, and just as much harm as any other set.", " See his sister here. Pity us!\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer, in a very business-like and logical manner, \u2018since you ask me what motive I have in reason, for taking young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, it is only reasonable to let you know. I have suspected young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first. I had had my eye upon him before that time, for I knew his ways. I have kept my observations to myself, but I have made them; and I have got ample proofs against him now, besides his running away, and besides his own confession, which I was just in time to overhear. I had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning, and following you here. I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby. Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom\u2019s situation. And I wish to have his situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.\u2019 \u2018If this is solely a question of self-interest with you\u2014\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind began. \u2018I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer; \u2018but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest. What you must always appeal to, is a person\u2019s self-interest. It\u2019s your only hold. We are so constituted. I was brought up in that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are aware.\u2019 \u2018What sum of money,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018will you set against your expected promotion?\u2019 \u2018Thank you, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018for hinting at the proposal; but I will not set any sum against it.", " \u2018Don\u2019t shed tears.

You are an affectionate, earnest, good young woman\u2014and\u2014and we must make that do.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, sir, very much,\u2019 said Sissy, with a grateful curtsey. \u2018You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you are serviceable in the family also; so I understand from Miss Louisa, and, indeed, so I have observed myself. I therefore hope,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018that you can make yourself happy in those relations.\u2019 \u2018I should have nothing to wish, sir, if\u2014\u2019 \u2018I understand you,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind; \u2018you still refer to your father. I have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle. Well! If your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been more successful, you would have been wiser on these points. I will say no more.\u2019 He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must have fallen upon that conclusion. Somehow or other, he had become possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could hardly be set forth in a tabular form. Her capacity of definition might be easily stated at a very low figure, her mathematical knowledge at nothing; yet he was not sure that if he had been required, for example, to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return, he would have quite known how to divide her."], "What philosophy does Gradgrind promote with his children and at his school?": [" Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything? Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can have got into the house? Because, in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so incomprehensible.\u2019 \u2018Stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility. \u2018You have one of those strollers\u2019 children in the school.\u2019 \u2018Cecilia Jupe, by name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken look at his friend. \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby.", " Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind; and I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed, would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank.\u2019 \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would have said, See how miserable I am! \u2018Bitzer, I have but one chance left to soften you. You were many years at my school. If, in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son, I entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance.\u2019 \u2018I really wonder, sir,\u2019 rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative manner, \u2018to find you taking a position so untenable. My schooling was paid for; it was a bargain; and when I came away, the bargain ended.\u2019 It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid for. Nobody was ever on any account to give anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase. Gratitude was to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be. Every inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a bargain across a counter. And if we didn\u2019t get to Heaven that way, it was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there. \u2018I don\u2019t deny,\u2019 added Bitzer, \u2018that my schooling was cheap.", " Good-bye, Thethilia!\u2019 \u2018Good-bye, Cecilia!\u2019 \u2018Good-bye, Sissy!\u2019 \u2018God bless you, dear!\u2019 In a variety of voices from all the room. But the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine oils in her bosom, and he now interposed with \u2018Leave the bottle, my dear; ith large to carry; it will be of no uthe to you now. Give it to me!\u2019 \u2018No, no!\u2019 she said, in another burst of tears. \u2018Oh, no! Pray let me keep it for father till he comes back! He will want it when he comes back.

Aged and bent he looked, and quite bowed down; and yet he looked a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days when in this life he wanted nothing\u2014but Facts. Before he left the room, he appointed a time for them to come to him; and so, with his gray head drooping, went away. \u2018Dear father,\u2019 said Louisa, when they kept their appointment, \u2018you have three young children left.

The rain fell, and the Smoke-serpents, submissive to the curse of all that tribe, trailed themselves upon the earth. In the waste-yard outside, the steam from the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the shining heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of mist and rain. The work went on, until the noon-bell rang. More clattering upon the pavements. The looms, and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour. Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets, haggard and worn. He turned from his own class and his own quarter, taking nothing but a little bread as he walked along, towards the hill on which his principal employer lived, in a red house with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps, BOUNDERBY (in letters very like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop. Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch. So Stephen had expected. Would his servant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him? Message in return, requiring name of such Hand. Stephen Blackpool.

Next night again, when she came home with the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke in the same low frightened tone. From the moment of that interchange of looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it. The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and Stephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of. On the fourth day, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to have miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from him with his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road, sixty miles away. Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town looked for Stephen to be brought in next day. During this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr. Bounderby like his shadow, assisting in all the proceedings. He was greatly excited, horribly fevered, bit his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard rattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up. At the hour when the suspected man was looked for, the whelp was at the station; offering to wager that he had made off before the arrival of those who were sent in quest of him, and that he would not appear. The whelp was right."], "Who is responsible for stealing from the bank?": [" All this, and more, in his hurry, and in hers, in the whirl of her own gratified malice, in the dread of being discovered, in the rapidly increasing noise of heavy rain among the leaves, and a thunderstorm rolling up\u2014Mrs. Sparsit received into her mind, set off with such an unavoidable halo of confusion and indistinctness, that when at length he climbed the fence and led his horse away, she was not sure where they were to meet, or when, except that they had said it was to be that night. But one of them yet remained in the darkness before her; and while she tracked that one she must be right. \u2018Oh, my dearest love,\u2019 thought Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018you little think how well attended you are!\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit saw her out of the wood, and saw her enter the house. What to do next? It rained now, in a sheet of water. Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s white stockings were of many colours, green predominating; prickly things were in her shoes; caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of their own making, from various parts of her dress; rills ran from her bonnet, and her Roman nose. In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the density of the shrubbery, considering what next? Lo, Louisa coming out of the house! Hastily cloaked and muffled, and stealing away. She elopes! She falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf. Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she struck into a side-path parallel with the ride.", " \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo!

James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed. \u2018Why, I am going to tell you,\u2019 said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you before.

Eager to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for the last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her hopes. Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs; and seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at the figure coming down. CHAPTER XI LOWER AND LOWER THE figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always verging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom. Mr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife\u2019s decease, made an expedition from London, and buried her in a business-like manner. He then returned with promptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes of other people who wanted other odds and ends\u2014in fact resumed his parliamentary duties. In the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward. Separated from her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through James Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.", " Still, if her father really has left her, without any connivance on her part\u2014Bounderby, let me have a word with you.\u2019 Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian walk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his face, and softly whistling. While thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby\u2019s voice as \u2018No. _I_ say no. I advise you not. I say by no means.\u2019 While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone the words, \u2018But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in. Think of it, Bounderby, in that point of view.\u2019 Meanwhile, the various members of Sleary\u2019s company gradually gathered together from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from standing about, talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers, gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room. There were two or three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands, and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children, who did the fairy business when required. The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the families on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often made a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the apex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins, ride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.", " There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms, whether native or foreign, and all about it. The bridesmaids, down to little Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of the company. After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness, I suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and know what I am, and what my extraction was, you won\u2019t expect a speech from a man who, when he sees a Post, says \u201cthat\u2019s a Post,\u201d and when he sees a Pump, says \u201cthat\u2019s a Pump,\u201d and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick. If you want a speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it. I am not your man. However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused.", " The air that would be healthful to the earth, the water that would enrich it, the heat that would ripen it, tear it when caged up. So in her bosom even now; the strongest qualities she possessed, long turned upon themselves, became a heap of obduracy, that rose against a friend. It was well that soft touch came upon her neck, and that she understood herself to be supposed to have fallen asleep. The sympathetic hand did not claim her resentment. Let it lie there, let it lie. It lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts; and she rested. As she softened with the quiet, and the consciousness of being so watched, some tears made their way into her eyes. The face touched hers, and she knew that there were tears upon it too, and she the cause of them. As Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy retired, so that she stood placidly near the bedside. \u2018I hope I have not disturbed you. I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you?\u2019 \u2018Why should you stay with me? My sister will miss you. You are everything to her.\u2019 \u2018Am I?\u2019 returned Sissy, shaking her head. \u2018I would be something to you, if I might.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Louisa, almost sternly. \u2018Whatever you want most, if I could be that. At all events, I would like to try to be as near it as I can. And however far off that may be, I will never tire of trying. Will you let me?\u2019 \u2018My father sent you to ask me.\u2019 \u2018No indeed,\u2019 replied Sissy."], "Who is the Gradgrind\u2019s eldest son?": [" Without turning his head, he conferred with her a few moments, and vanished. Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the people moved. When the father reached home, he sent a message to Mr. Bounderby\u2019s, desiring his son to come to him directly. The reply was, that Mr. Bounderby having missed him in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him since, had supposed him to be at Stone Lodge. \u2018I believe, father,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018he will not come back to town to-night.\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind turned away, and said no more. In the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was opened, and seeing his son\u2019s place empty (he had not the courage to look in at first) went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way there. To whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but entreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ his son at a distance for a little while. Also, that he was charged with the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool\u2019s memory, and declaring the thief. Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street after his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense soap-bubble, without its beauty. Mr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that day. When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening it, \u2018Not now, my dears; in the evening.\u2019 On their return in the evening, he said, \u2018I am not able yet\u2014to-morrow.\u2019 He ate nothing all day, and had no candle after dark; and they heard him walking to and fro late at night.", " And I never have, except with looking at him once a year, when he has never knowed it. And it\u2019s right,\u2019 said poor old Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate championship, \u2018that I _should_ keep down in my own part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a many unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my pride in my Josiah to myself, and I can love for love\u2019s own sake! And I am ashamed of you, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Pegler, lastly, \u2018for your slanders and suspicions. And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no. And I shouldn\u2019t be here now, if it hadn\u2019t been for being brought here. And for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my son standing here to tell you so different!\u2019 The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had never ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and larger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short. \u2018I don\u2019t exactly know,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018how I come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company, but I don\u2019t inquire. When they\u2019re quite satisfied, perhaps they\u2019ll be so good as to disperse; whether they\u2019re satisfied or not, perhaps they\u2019ll be so good as to disperse.", " \u2018How was what done?\u2019 moodily answered the son. \u2018This robbery,\u2019 said the father, raising his voice upon the word. \u2018I forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up ajar before I went away. I had had the key that was found, made long before. I dropped it that morning, that it might be supposed to have been used. I didn\u2019t take the money all at once. I pretended to put my balance away every night, but I didn\u2019t. Now you know all about it.\u2019 \u2018If a thunderbolt had fallen on me,\u2019 said the father, \u2018it would have shocked me less than this!\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t see why,\u2019 grumbled the son. \u2018So many people are employed in situations of trust; so many people, out of so many, will be dishonest. I have heard you talk, a hundred times, of its being a law. How can _I_ help laws? You have comforted others with such things, father. Comfort yourself!\u2019 The father buried his face in his hands, and the son stood in his disgraceful grotesqueness, biting straw: his hands, with the black partly worn away inside, looking like the hands of a monkey. The evening was fast closing in; and from time to time, he turned the whites of his eyes restlessly and impatiently towards his father. They were the only parts of his face that showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was so thick. \u2018You must be got to Liverpool, and sent abroad.\u2019 \u2018I suppose I must. I can\u2019t be more miserable anywhere,\u2019 whimpered the whelp, \u2018than I have been here, ever since I can remember.", " \u2018This, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind\u2019s eldest daughter. Loo, Mr. James Harthouse. Mr. Harthouse has joined your father\u2019s muster-roll. If he is not Tom Gradgrind\u2019s colleague before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns. You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior. I don\u2019t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw something in me, I suppose, or she wouldn\u2019t have married me. She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise. If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby.\u2019 To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to learn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended. \u2018Come!\u2019 said his host. \u2018If you\u2019re in the complimentary line, you\u2019ll get on here, for you\u2019ll meet with no competition. I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I don\u2019t profess to understand the art of paying \u2019em. In fact, despise \u2019em. But, your bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real thing, by George! You\u2019re a gentleman, and I don\u2019t pretend to be one. I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, and that\u2019s enough for me. However, though I am not influenced by manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be. She hadn\u2019t my advantages\u2014disadvantages you would call \u2019em, but I call \u2019em advantages\u2014so you\u2019ll not waste your power, I dare say.\u2019 \u2018Mr."], "What was Sissy's father's profession?": [" \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth. And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as if he was in pain. And I said, \u201cHave you hurt yourself, father?\u201d (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, \u201cA little, my darling.\u201d And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying. The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first he shook all over, and said nothing but \u201cMy darling;\u201d and \u201cMy love!\u201d\u2019 Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much of that at present.", " It\u2019s as much as he can do to write; and it\u2019s more than people in general can do to read his writing. Though it\u2019s plain to _me_.\u2019 \u2018Your mother?\u2019 \u2018Father says she was quite a scholar. She died when I was born. She was;\u2019 Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; \u2018she was a dancer.\u2019 \u2018Did your father love her?\u2019 Louisa asked these questions with a strong, wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and hiding in solitary places. \u2018O yes! As dearly as he loves me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from that time.\u2019 \u2018Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do. When he left me for my good\u2014he never would have left me for his own\u2014I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial. He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back.\u2019 \u2018Tell me more about him,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018I will never ask you again. Where did you live?\u2019 \u2018We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in. Father\u2019s a;\u2019 Sissy whispered the awful word, \u2018a clown.\u2019 \u2018To make the people laugh?\u2019 said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence. \u2018Yes. But they wouldn\u2019t laugh sometimes, and then father cried. Lately, they very often wouldn\u2019t laugh, and he used to come home despairing. Father\u2019s not like most. Those who didn\u2019t know him as well as I do, and didn\u2019t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right.", " And that was wrong, too.\u2019 \u2018Of course it was.\u2019 \u2018Then Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said he would try me once more. And he said, Here are the stutterings\u2014\u2019 \u2018Statistics,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Yes, Miss Louisa\u2014they always remind me of stutterings, and that\u2019s another of my mistakes\u2014of accidents upon the sea. And I find (Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death. What is the percentage? And I said, Miss;\u2019 here Sissy fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest error; \u2018I said it was nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Miss\u2014to the relations and friends of the people who were killed. I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed.", " \u2018I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,\u2019 observed his sister. \u2018You have no occasion to go away; but don\u2019t interrupt us for a moment, Tom dear.\u2019 \u2018Oh! very well!\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018Only father has brought old Bounderby home, and I want you to come into the drawing-room. Because if you come, there\u2019s a good chance of old Bounderby\u2019s asking me to dinner; and if you don\u2019t, there\u2019s none.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll come directly.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll wait for you,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018to make sure.\u2019 Sissy resumed in a lower voice. \u2018At last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again, and never did give any satisfaction now, and that he was a shame and disgrace, and I should have done better without him all along. I said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him, and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there. When I had no more left to tell, he put his arms round my neck, and kissed me a great many times. Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used, for the little hurt he had had, and to get it at the best place, which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after kissing me again, he let me go. When I had gone down-stairs, I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet, and looked in at the door, and said, \u201cFather dear, shall I take Merrylegs?\u201d Father shook his head and said, \u201cNo, Sissy, no; take nothing that\u2019s known to be mine, my darling;\u201d and I left him sitting by the fire."], "Who does Stephen love?": [" Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the shocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to which it has led. Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive you as I do!\u2019 The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone. But, when Louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh. \u2018Not you. I don\u2019t want to have anything to say to you!\u2019 \u2018O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!\u2019 \u2018After all your love!\u2019 he returned, obdurately. \u2018Pretty love! Leaving old Bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and going home just when I was in the greatest danger. Pretty love that! Coming out with every word about our having gone to that place, when you saw the net was gathering round me. Pretty love that! You have regularly given me up. You never cared for me.\u2019 \u2018Tharp\u2019th the word!\u2019 said Sleary, at the door. They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she forgave him, and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one ran against them. Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both before him while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled. For, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when other people ran themselves into a glow.", " It was impossible to hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she would have flung herself down the shaft. \u2018Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these dreadful cries! Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\u2019 By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of such a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her with a tearless face of stone. \u2018Rachael, Stephen may be living. You wouldn\u2019t leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?\u2019 \u2018No, no, no!\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t stir from here, for his sake! Let me go and listen.\u2019 She shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on her hands and knees, and called to him as loud as she could call. She listened, but no sound replied. She called again and listened; still no answering sound. She did this, twenty, thirty times. She took a little clod of earth from the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in. She could not hear it fall. The wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago, almost carried despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all round her, seeing no help. \u2018Rachael, we must lose not a moment. We must go in different directions, seeking aid. You shall go by the way we have come, and I will go forward by the path. Tell any one you see, and every one what has happened.", " \u2018I ha never thowt yet, missus,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018o\u2019 askin thy name.\u2019 The old lady announced herself as \u2018Mrs. Pegler.\u2019 \u2018A widder, I think?\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Oh, many long years!\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s husband (one of the best on record) was already dead, by Mrs. Pegler\u2019s calculation, when Stephen was born. \u2018\u2019Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Onny children?\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted some nervousness on her part. \u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018Not now, not now.\u2019 \u2018Dead, Stephen,\u2019 Rachael softly hinted. \u2018I\u2019m sooary I ha spok\u2019n on \u2019t,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018I ought t\u2019 hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place. I\u2014I blame myseln.\u2019 While he excused himself, the old lady\u2019s cup rattled more and more. \u2018I had a son,\u2019 she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; \u2018and he did well, wonderfully well. But he is not to be spoken of if you please. He is\u2014\u2019 Putting down her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have added, by her action, \u2018dead!\u2019 Then she said aloud, \u2018I have lost him.\u2019 Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear. Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was uttered. \u2018Bounderby!\u2019 she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. \u2018Oh hide me!", " Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.\u2019 Silence between them. The deadly statistical clock very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy. \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question. \u2018Well, my child,\u2019 he returned, \u2018I\u2014really\u2014cannot take upon myself to say.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, \u2018do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa, no. No. I ask nothing.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 she still pursued, \u2018does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?\u2019 \u2018Really, my dear,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018it is difficult to answer your question\u2014\u2019 \u2018Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father? \u2018Certainly, my dear. Because;\u2019 here was something to demonstrate, and it set him up again; \u2018because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on the sense in which we use the expression. Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice, and does not do himself the injustice, of pretending to anything fanciful, fantastic, or (I am using synonymous terms) sentimental. Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes, to very little purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense, not to say to his, as to address you from any such ground. Therefore, perhaps the expression itself\u2014I merely suggest this to you, my dear\u2014may be a little misplaced.\u2019 \u2018What would you advise me to use in its stead, father?\u2019 \u2018Why, my dear Louisa,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, completely recovered by this time, \u2018I would advise you (since you ask me) to consider this question, as you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as one of tangible Fact."], "Who is revealed to be Mr. Bounderby's mother?": [" Left alone with her mother, Louisa saw her lying with an awful lull upon her face, like one who was floating away upon some great water, all resistance over, content to be carried down the stream. She put the shadow of a hand to her lips again, and recalled her. \u2018You were going to speak to me, mother.\u2019 \u2018Eh? Yes, to be sure, my dear. You know your father is almost always away now, and therefore I must write to him about it.\u2019 \u2018About what, mother? Don\u2019t be troubled. About what?\u2019 \u2018You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have said anything, on any subject, I have never heard the last of it: and consequently, that I have long left off saying anything.\u2019 \u2018I can hear you, mother.\u2019 But, it was only by dint of bending down to her ear, and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved, that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion. \u2018You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your brother. Ologies of all kinds from morning to night. If there is any Ology left, of any description, that has not been worn to rags in this house, all I can say is, I hope I shall never hear its name.\u2019 \u2018I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go on.\u2019 This, to keep her from floating away. \u2018But there is something\u2014not an Ology at all\u2014that your father has missed, or forgotten, Louisa. I don\u2019t know what it is. I have often sat with Sissy near me, and thought about it.", " \u2018Very well,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran away from me. Do I excuse her for it? No. Have I ever excused her for it? Not I. What do I call her for it? I call her probably the very worst woman that ever lived in the world, except my drunken grandmother. There\u2019s no family pride about me, there\u2019s no imaginative sentimental humbug about me. I call a spade a spade; and I call the mother of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, without any fear or any favour, what I should call her if she had been the mother of Dick Jones of Wapping. So, with this man. He is a runaway rogue and a vagabond, that\u2019s what he is, in English.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s all the same to me what he is or what he is not, whether in English or whether in French,\u2019 retorted Mr. E. W. B. Childers, facing about. \u2018I am telling your friend what\u2019s the fact; if you don\u2019t like to hear it, you can avail yourself of the open air. You give it mouth enough, you do; but give it mouth in your own building at least,\u2019 remonstrated E. W. B. with stern irony. \u2018Don\u2019t give it mouth in this building, till you\u2019re called upon. You have got some building of your own I dare say, now?\u2019 \u2018Perhaps so,\u2019 replied Mr. Bounderby, rattling his money and laughing. \u2018Then give it mouth in your own building, will you, if you please?\u2019 said Childers. \u2018Because this isn\u2019t a strong building, and too much of you might bring it down!\u2019 Eyeing Mr. Bounderby from head to foot again, he turned from him, as from a man finally disposed of, to Mr. Gradgrind.", " \u2018No! As wet as a sop. A foot of water in it,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Enough to give a baby cold,\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind considered. \u2018Cold? I was born with inflammation of the lungs, and of everything else, I believe, that was capable of inflammation,\u2019 returned Mr. Bounderby. \u2018For years, ma\u2019am, I was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen. I was so sickly, that I was always moaning and groaning. I was so ragged and dirty, that you wouldn\u2019t have touched me with a pair of tongs.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most appropriate thing her imbecility could think of doing. \u2018How I fought through it, _I_ don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I was determined, I suppose. I have been a determined character in later life, and I suppose I was then. Here I am, Mrs. Gradgrind, anyhow, and nobody to thank for my being here, but myself.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his mother\u2014 \u2018_My_ mother? Bolted, ma\u2019am!\u2019 said Bounderby. Mrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it up. \u2018My mother left me to my grandmother,\u2019 said Bounderby; \u2018and, according to the best of my remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived. If I got a little pair of shoes by any chance, she would take \u2019em off and sell \u2019em for drink. Why, I have known that grandmother of mine lie in her bed and drink her four-teen glasses of liquor before breakfast!\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of vitality, looked (as she always did) like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure, without enough light behind it.", " Though I do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points\u2014more foolish if the term is preferred\u2014than they might have been, if I had always occupied my present position.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse, as much as to say, \u2018I am the proprietor of this female, and she\u2019s worth your attention, I think.\u2019 Then, resumed his discourse. \u2018You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to him when you saw him. I didn\u2019t mince the matter with him. I am never mealy with \u2019em. I KNOW \u2019em. Very well, sir. Three days after that, he bolted. Went off, nobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancy\u2014only with this difference, that he is a worse subject than my mother, if possible. What did he do before he went? What do you say;\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, with his hat in his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences, as if it were a tambourine; \u2018to his being seen\u2014night after night\u2014watching the Bank?\u2014to his lurking about there\u2014after dark?\u2014To its striking Mrs. Sparsit\u2014that he could be lurking for no good\u2014To her calling Bitzer\u2019s attention to him, and their both taking notice of him\u2014And to its appearing on inquiry to-day\u2014that he was also noticed by the neighbours?\u2019 Having come to the climax, Mr. Bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put his tambourine on his head. \u2018Suspicious,\u2019 said James Harthouse, \u2018certainly.\u2019 \u2018I think so, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, with a defiant nod."], "Who is initially a bully at Gradgrind's school, and later becomes an employee and a spy at Bounderby's bank?": [" Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything? Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can have got into the house? Because, in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so incomprehensible.\u2019 \u2018Stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility. \u2018You have one of those strollers\u2019 children in the school.\u2019 \u2018Cecilia Jupe, by name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken look at his friend. \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby.", " I\u2019m not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs, I have not undertaken to do it, and I\u2019m not a going to do it. Therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject, will be disappointed\u2014particularly Tom Gradgrind, and he can\u2019t know it too soon. In reference to the Bank robbery, there has been a mistake made, concerning my mother. If there hadn\u2019t been over-officiousness it wouldn\u2019t have been made, and I hate over-officiousness at all times, whether or no. Good evening!\u2019 Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms, holding the door open for the company to depart, there was a blustering sheepishness upon him, at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd. Detected as the Bully of humility, who had built his windy reputation upon lies, and in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if he had advanced the mean claim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on to a pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figure. With the people filing off at the door he held, who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole town, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.

But they got through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary, saving for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive eye than into his fixed one. The performance seemed a little long to Sissy and Louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling Mr. Sleary (who said \u2018Indeed, sir!\u2019 to all his observations in the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs, and laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs, and threw \u2019em at four legs, who ran away with one leg. For, although an ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged stool, a dog, and a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great suspense. At last, however, little fair-haired Josephine made her curtsey amid great applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had just warmed himself, and said, \u2018Now _I_\u2019ll have a turn!\u2019 when Sissy was touched on the shoulder, and beckoned out. She took Louisa with her; and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very little private apartment, with canvas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden ceiling all aslant, on which the box company stamped their approbation, as if they were coming through.", " Thath my name, Thquire.

Mr. Sleary stood in the middle of the room, with the male members of the company about him, exactly as he would have stood in the centre of the ring during his daughter Josephine\u2019s performance. He wanted nothing but his whip. The basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her, and smoothed her disordered hair, and put it on.

Here was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day, and in the same hour, sitting thoughtful in his own room. How much of futurity did _he_ see? Did he see himself, a white-haired decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible theories to appointed circumstances; making his facts and figures subservient to Faith, Hope, and Charity; and no longer trying to grind that Heavenly trio in his dusty little mills? Did he catch sight of himself, therefore much despised by his late political associates? Did he see them, in the era of its being quite settled that the national dustmen have only to do with one another, and owe no duty to an abstraction called a People, \u2018taunting the honourable gentleman\u2019 with this and with that and with what not, five nights a-week, until the small hours of the morning? Probably he had that much foreknowledge, knowing his men. * * * * * Here was Louisa on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in days of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler face. How much of the future might arise before _her_ vision? Broadsides in the streets, signed with her father\u2019s name, exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool, weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own son, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not bring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the Present.", " With my head in its present state, I couldn\u2019t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the reason!\u2019 pouted Louisa. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s the reason, because it can\u2019t be nothing of the sort,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018Go and be somethingological directly.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit. In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s stock of facts in general was woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position, had been influenced by two reasons. Firstly, she was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had \u2018no nonsense\u2019 about her. By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was. The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact. So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her. \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, \u2018you are always so interested in my young people\u2014particularly in Louisa\u2014that I make no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this discovery. I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the education of the reason of my family.", " Harthouse Dining at the Bounderbys\u2019_ 100 _Mr. Harthouse and Tom Gradgrind in the Garden_ 132 _Stephen Blackpool recovered from the Old Hell Shaft_ 206 BOOK THE FIRST _SOWING_ CHAPTER I THE ONE THING NEEDFUL \u2018NOW, what I want is, Facts.

Stick to Facts, sir!\u2019 The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room, and the speaker\u2019s square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring every sentence with a line on the schoolmaster\u2019s sleeve. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s square wall of a forehead, which had his eyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves, overshadowed by the wall. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s voice, which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s hair, which bristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside."], "How does Louisa not conform to the Victorian ideal of femininity?": [" The townspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw her there, regarded her as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine. What those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did. Gold and silver coin, precious paper, secrets that if divulged would bring vague destruction upon vague persons (generally, however, people whom she disliked), were the chief items in her ideal catalogue thereof. For the rest, she knew that after office-hours, she reigned supreme over all the office furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three locks, against the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head every night, on a truckle bed, that disappeared at cockcrow. Further, she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply spiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the relics of the current day\u2019s work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out pens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit tried. Lastly, she was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and carbines, arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official chimney-pieces; and over that respectable tradition never to be separated from a place of business claiming to be wealthy\u2014a row of fire-buckets\u2014vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any occasion, but observed to exercise a fine moral influence, almost equal to bullion, on most beholders.", " Even when their eyes had met, and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes looking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive hand, before she asked: \u2018When was I brought to this room?\u2019 \u2018Last night, Louisa.\u2019 \u2018Who brought me here?\u2019 \u2018Sissy, I believe.\u2019 \u2018Why do you believe so?\u2019 \u2018Because I found her here this morning. She didn\u2019t come to my bedside to wake me, as she always does; and I went to look for her. She was not in her own room either; and I went looking for her all over the house, until I found her here taking care of you and cooling your head. Will you see father? Sissy said I was to tell him when you woke.\u2019 \u2018What a beaming face you have, Jane!\u2019 said Louisa, as her young sister\u2014timidly still\u2014bent down to kiss her. \u2018Have I? I am very glad you think so. I am sure it must be Sissy\u2019s doing.\u2019 The arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck, unbent itself. \u2018You can tell father if you will.\u2019 Then, staying her for a moment, she said, \u2018It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of welcome?\u2019 \u2018Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came. It was\u2014\u2019 Louisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more. When her sister had withdrawn, she turned her head back again, and lay with her face towards the door, until it opened and her father entered. He had a jaded anxious look upon him, and his hand, usually steady, trembled in hers. He sat down at the side of the bed, tenderly asking how she was, and dwelling on the necessity of her keeping very quiet after her agitation and exposure to the weather last night.", " All that is difficult to me now, would be so easy then.\u2019 \u2018You might not be the better for it, Sissy.\u2019 Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, \u2018I should not be the worse, Miss Louisa.\u2019 To which Miss Louisa answered, \u2018I don\u2019t know that.\u2019 There had been so little communication between these two\u2014both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition relative to Sissy\u2019s past career\u2014that they were still almost strangers. Sissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa\u2019s face, was uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent. \u2018You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than I can ever be,\u2019 Louisa resumed. \u2018You are pleasanter to yourself, than _I_ am to _my_self.\u2019 \u2018But, if you please, Miss Louisa,\u2019 Sissy pleaded, \u2018I am\u2014O so stupid!\u2019 Louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would be wiser by-and-by. \u2018You don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Sissy, half crying, \u2018what a stupid girl I am. All through school hours I make mistakes. Mr. and Mrs. M\u2019Choakumchild call me up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes. I can\u2019t help them. They seem to come natural to me.\u2019 \u2018Mr. and Mrs. M\u2019Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018O no!\u2019 she eagerly returned. \u2018They know everything.\u2019 \u2018Tell me some of your mistakes.\u2019 \u2018I am almost ashamed,\u2019 said Sissy, with reluctance.", " Louisa had sat by her for some minutes, and had spoken to her often, before she arrived at a clear understanding who it was. She then seemed to come to it all at once. \u2018Well, my dear,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind, \u2018and I hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself. It was all your father\u2019s doing. He set his heart upon it. And he ought to know.\u2019 \u2018I want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.\u2019 \u2018You want to hear of me, my dear? That\u2019s something new, I am sure, when anybody wants to hear of me. Not at all well, Louisa. Very faint and giddy.\u2019 \u2018Are you in pain, dear mother?\u2019 \u2018I think there\u2019s a pain somewhere in the room,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind, \u2018but I couldn\u2019t positively say that I have got it.\u2019 After this strange speech, she lay silent for some time. Louisa, holding her hand, could feel no pulse; but kissing it, could see a slight thin thread of life in fluttering motion. \u2018You very seldom see your sister,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018She grows like you. I wish you would look at her. Sissy, bring her here.\u2019 She was brought, and stood with her hand in her sister\u2019s. Louisa had observed her with her arm round Sissy\u2019s neck, and she felt the difference of this approach. \u2018Do you see the likeness, Louisa?\u2019 \u2018Yes, mother. I should think her like me. But\u2014\u2019 \u2018Eh! Yes, I always say so,\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind cried, with unexpected quickness. \u2018And that reminds me. I\u2014I want to speak to you, my dear. Sissy, my good girl, leave us alone a minute.\u2019 Louisa had relinquished the hand: had thought that her sister\u2019s was a better and brighter face than hers had ever been: had seen in it, not without a rising feeling of resentment, even in that place and at that time, something of the gentleness of the other face in the room; the sweet face with the trusting eyes, made paler than watching and sympathy made it, by the rich dark hair."], "Bounderby's attitude is representative of the social changes created by ___.": [" I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life. If I have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences, and can scarcely hear enough of them, I claim no merit for that, since I believe it is a general sentiment.\u2019 \u2018Well, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said her patron, \u2018perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear, in his own unpolished way, what Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown, has gone through. But you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury, yourself. Come, ma\u2019am, you know you were born in the lap of luxury.\u2019 \u2018I do not, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit with a shake of her head, \u2018deny it.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table, and stand with his back to the fire, looking at her; she was such an enhancement of his position. \u2018And you were in crack society. Devilish high society,\u2019 he said, warming his legs. \u2018It is true, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with an affectation of humility the very opposite of his, and therefore in no danger of jostling it. \u2018You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon her. \u2018It is unquestionably true.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud. Mr. and Miss Gradgrind being then announced, he received the former with a shake of the hand, and the latter with a kiss.", " I tell you that the hour is come, when we must rally round one another as One united power, and crumble into dust the oppressors that too long have battened upon the plunder of our families, upon the sweat of our brows, upon the labour of our hands, upon the strength of our sinews, upon the God-created glorious rights of Humanity, and upon the holy and eternal privileges of Brotherhood!\u2019 \u2018Good!\u2019 \u2018Hear, hear, hear!\u2019 \u2018Hurrah!\u2019 and other cries, arose in many voices from various parts of the densely crowded and suffocatingly close Hall, in which the orator, perched on a stage, delivered himself of this and what other froth and fume he had in him. He had declaimed himself into a violent heat, and was as hoarse as he was hot. By dint of roaring at the top of his voice under a flaring gaslight, clenching his fists, knitting his brows, setting his teeth, and pounding with his arms, he had taken so much out of himself by this time, that he was brought to a stop, and called for a glass of water. As he stood there, trying to quench his fiery face with his drink of water, the comparison between the orator and the crowd of attentive faces turned towards him, was extremely to his disadvantage. Judging him by Nature\u2019s evidence, he was above the mass in very little but the stage on which he stood. In many great respects he was essentially below them. He was not so honest, he was not so manly, he was not so good-humoured; he substituted cunning for their simplicity, and passion for their safe solid sense.", " I hope I shall be.\u2019 \u2018_Do_ you, sir!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with great affability. \u2018But naturally you do; of course you do.\u2019 A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby\u2019s part, succeeded. Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough, which sounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance. \u2018Well, ma\u2019am,\u2019 resumed Bounderby, \u2018under these circumstances, I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here, though you would be very welcome here.\u2019 \u2018Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit shook her head, still in her highly superior manner, and a little changed the small cough\u2014coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her, but had better be coughed down. \u2018However, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018there are apartments at the Bank, where a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a catch than otherwise; and if the same terms\u2014\u2019 \u2018I beg your pardon, sir. You were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase, annual compliment.\u2019 \u2018Well, ma\u2019am, annual compliment. If the same annual compliment would be acceptable there, why, I see nothing to part us, unless you do.\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018The proposal is like yourself, and if the position I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale\u2014\u2019 \u2018Why, of course it is,\u2019 said Bounderby.", " Perhaps you\u2019re mistaken, and never wrote any.\u2019 \u2018He hadn\u2019t been gone from here, young lady,\u2019 said Rachael, turning appealingly to Louisa, \u2018as much as a week, when he sent me the only letter I have had from him, saying that he was forced to seek work in another name.\u2019 \u2018Oh, by George!\u2019 cried Bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, \u2018he changes his name, does he! That\u2019s rather unlucky, too, for such an immaculate chap. It\u2019s considered a little suspicious in Courts of Justice, I believe, when an Innocent happens to have many names.\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes again, \u2018what, young lady, in the name of Mercy, was left the poor lad to do! The masters against him on one hand, the men against him on the other, he only wantin to work hard in peace, and do what he felt right. Can a man have no soul of his own, no mind of his own? Must he go wrong all through wi\u2019 this side, or must he go wrong all through wi\u2019 that, or else be hunted like a hare?\u2019 \u2018Indeed, indeed, I pity him from my heart,\u2019 returned Louisa; \u2018and I hope that he will clear himself.\u2019 \u2018You need have no fear of that, young lady. He is sure!\u2019 \u2018All the surer, I suppose,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018for your refusing to tell where he is? Eh?\u2019 \u2018He shall not, through any act of mine, come back wi\u2019 the unmerited reproach of being brought back. He shall come back of his own accord to clear himself, and put all those that have injured his good character, and he not here for its defence, to shame."], "Which of these characters is of the working class?": [" The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round the placards, devouring them with eager eyes. Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read. These people, as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud\u2014there was always some such ready to help them\u2014stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil. Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling wheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets, there were still as many readers as before. Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had brought it in his pocket. Oh, my friends and fellow-countrymen, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown, oh, my fellow-brothers and fellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellow-men, what a to-do was there, when Slackbridge unfolded what he called \u2018that damning document,\u2019 and held it up to the gaze, and for the execration of the working-man community! \u2018Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what a traitor in the camp of those great spirits who are enrolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and of Union, is appropriately capable!", " So, Stephen Blackpool\u2019s tombstone, with her father\u2019s record of his death, was almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be. These things she could plainly see. But, how much of the Future? A working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once again appearing at the ringing of the Factory bell, and passing to and fro at the set hours, among the Coketown Hands; a woman of pensive beauty, always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and even cheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have compassion on a degraded, drunken wretch of her own sex, who was sometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her, and crying to her; a woman working, ever working, but content to do it, and preferring to do it as her natural lot, until she should be too old to labour any more? Did Louisa see this? Such a thing was to be. A lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on paper blotted with tears, that her words had too soon come true, and that all the treasures in the world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her dear face? At length this brother coming nearer home, with hope of seeing her, and being delayed by illness; and then a letter, in a strange hand, saying \u2018he died in hospital, of fever, such a day, and died in penitence and love of you: his last word being your name\u2019? Did Louisa see these things? Such things were to be. Herself again a wife\u2014a mother\u2014lovingly watchful of her children, ever careful that they should have a childhood of the mind no less than a childhood of the body, as knowing it to be even a more beautiful thing, and a possession, any hoarded scrap of which, is a blessing and happiness to the wisest?", " CHAPTER XII THE OLD WOMAN OLD STEPHEN descended the two white steps, shutting the black door with the brazen door-plate, by the aid of the brazen full-stop, to which he gave a parting polish with the sleeve of his coat, observing that his hot hand clouded it. He crossed the street with his eyes bent upon the ground, and thus was walking sorrowfully away, when he felt a touch upon his arm. It was not the touch he needed most at such a moment\u2014the touch that could calm the wild waters of his soul, as the uplifted hand of the sublimest love and patience could abate the raging of the sea\u2014yet it was a woman\u2019s hand too. It was an old woman, tall and shapely still, though withered by time, on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and turned. She was very cleanly and plainly dressed, had country mud upon her shoes, and was newly come from a journey. The flutter of her manner, in the unwonted noise of the streets; the spare shawl, carried unfolded on her arm; the heavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered gloves, to which her hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman from the country, in her plain holiday clothes, come into Coketown on an expedition of rare occurrence. Remarking this at a glance, with the quick observation of his class, Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face\u2014his face, which, like the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with eyes and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the concentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the deaf\u2014the better to hear what she asked him.", " The solitary exception was the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door, terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs. All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe characters of black and white. The jail might have been the infirmary, the infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been either, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction. Fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the immaterial. The M\u2019Choakumchild school was all fact, and the school of design was all fact, and the relations between master and man were all fact, and everything was fact between the lying-in hospital and the cemetery, and what you couldn\u2019t state in figures, or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest, was not, and never should be, world without end, Amen. A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course got on well? Why no, not quite well. No? Dear me! No. Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in all respects like gold that had stood the fire. First, the perplexing mystery of the place was, Who belonged to the eighteen denominations? Because, whoever did, the labouring people did not. It was very strange to walk through the streets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of _them_ the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away from their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of their own streets, where they lounged listlessly, gazing at all the church and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern."], "Bounderby claims that, \"what is called taste is only another name for ___.\"": [" Do you?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir!\u2019 from one half. \u2018No, sir!\u2019 from the other. \u2018Of course no,\u2019 said the gentleman, with an indignant look at the wrong half. \u2018Why, then, you are not to see anywhere, what you don\u2019t see in fact; you are not to have anywhere, what you don\u2019t have in fact. What is called Taste, is only another name for Fact.\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind nodded his approbation. \u2018This is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,\u2019 said the gentleman. \u2018Now, I\u2019ll try you again. Suppose you were going to carpet a room. Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it?\u2019 There being a general conviction by this time that \u2018No, sir!\u2019 was always the right answer to this gentleman, the chorus of NO was very strong. Only a few feeble stragglers said Yes: among them Sissy Jupe. \u2018Girl number twenty,\u2019 said the gentleman, smiling in the calm strength of knowledge. Sissy blushed, and stood up. \u2018So you would carpet your room\u2014or your husband\u2019s room, if you were a grown woman, and had a husband\u2014with representations of flowers, would you?\u2019 said the gentleman. \u2018Why would you?\u2019 \u2018If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,\u2019 returned the girl. \u2018And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have people walking over them with heavy boots?\u2019 \u2018It wouldn\u2019t hurt them, sir. They wouldn\u2019t crush and wither, if you please, sir. They would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant, and I would fancy\u2014\u2019 \u2018Ay, ay, ay!", " Her remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the drying up of every spring and fountain in her young heart as it gushed out. The golden waters were not there. They were flowing for the fertilization of the land where grapes are gathered from thorns, and figs from thistles. She went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her, into the house and into her mother\u2019s room. Since the time of her leaving home, Sissy had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms. Sissy was at her mother\u2019s side; and Jane, her sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in the room. There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind that her eldest child was there. She reclined, propped up, from mere habit, on a couch: as nearly in her old usual attitude, as anything so helpless could be kept in. She had positively refused to take to her bed; on the ground that if she did, she would never hear the last of it. Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom of a well. The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had been: which had much to do with it. On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she replied, at cross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since he married Louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable name, she had called him J; and that she could not at present depart from that regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.", " Mr. Bounderby\u2019s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor. He next had recourse to the administration of potent restoratives, such as screwing the patient\u2019s thumbs, smiting her hands, abundantly watering her face, and inserting salt in her mouth. When these attentions had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled her into a fast train without offering any other refreshment, and carried her back to Coketown more dead than alive. Regarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle on her arrival at her journey\u2019s end; but considered in any other light, the amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive, and impaired her claims to admiration. Utterly heedless of the wear and tear of her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, Mr. Bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to Stone Lodge. \u2018Now, Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, bursting into his father-in-law\u2019s room late at night; \u2018here\u2019s a lady here\u2014Mrs. Sparsit\u2014you know Mrs. Sparsit\u2014who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.\u2019 \u2018You have missed my letter!\u2019 exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind, surprised by the apparition. \u2018Missed your letter, sir!\u2019 bawled Bounderby. \u2018The present time is no time for letters. No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters, with his mind in the state it\u2019s in now.\u2019 \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, \u2018I speak of a very special letter I have written to you, in reference to Louisa.\u2019 \u2018Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on the table, \u2018I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me, in reference to Louisa.", " Perhaps you\u2019re mistaken, and never wrote any.\u2019 \u2018He hadn\u2019t been gone from here, young lady,\u2019 said Rachael, turning appealingly to Louisa, \u2018as much as a week, when he sent me the only letter I have had from him, saying that he was forced to seek work in another name.\u2019 \u2018Oh, by George!\u2019 cried Bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, \u2018he changes his name, does he!

It\u2019s considered a little suspicious in Courts of Justice, I believe, when an Innocent happens to have many names.\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Rachael, with the tears in her eyes again, \u2018what, young lady, in the name of Mercy, was left the poor lad to do!

His eminently practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said, \u2018Behold your Bounderby!\u2019 \u2018Well!\u2019 blustered Mr. Bounderby, \u2018what\u2019s the matter? What is young Thomas in the dumps about?\u2019 He spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa. \u2018We were peeping at the circus,\u2019 muttered Louisa, haughtily, without lifting up her eyes, \u2018and father caught us.\u2019 \u2018And, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said her husband in a lofty manner, \u2018I should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry.\u2019 \u2018Dear me,\u2019 whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018How can you, Louisa and Thomas! I wonder at you. I declare you\u2019re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all. I have a great mind to say I wish I hadn\u2019t. _Then_ what would you have done, I should like to know?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks. He frowned impatiently. \u2018As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldn\u2019t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of circuses!\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018You know, as well as I do, no young people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend lectures about circuses. What can you possibly want to know of circuses then? I am sure you have enough to do, if that\u2019s what you want.", " The air that would be healthful to the earth, the water that would enrich it, the heat that would ripen it, tear it when caged up. So in her bosom even now; the strongest qualities she possessed, long turned upon themselves, became a heap of obduracy, that rose against a friend. It was well that soft touch came upon her neck, and that she understood herself to be supposed to have fallen asleep. The sympathetic hand did not claim her resentment. Let it lie there, let it lie. It lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts; and she rested. As she softened with the quiet, and the consciousness of being so watched, some tears made their way into her eyes. The face touched hers, and she knew that there were tears upon it too, and she the cause of them. As Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy retired, so that she stood placidly near the bedside. \u2018I hope I have not disturbed you. I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you?\u2019 \u2018Why should you stay with me? My sister will miss you. You are everything to her.\u2019 \u2018Am I?\u2019 returned Sissy, shaking her head. \u2018I would be something to you, if I might.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Louisa, almost sternly. \u2018Whatever you want most, if I could be that. At all events, I would like to try to be as near it as I can. And however far off that may be, I will never tire of trying. Will you let me?\u2019 \u2018My father sent you to ask me.\u2019 \u2018No indeed,\u2019 replied Sissy.", " \u2018Too plain!\u2019 He shaded his face, and remained silent for some moments. Recovering himself, he said: \u2018And now, how is he to be found? How is he to be saved from justice? In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he to be found by us, and only by us? Ten thousand pounds could not effect it.\u2019 \u2018Sissy has effected it, father.\u2019 He raised his eyes to where she stood, like a good fairy in his house, and said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness, \u2018It is always you, my child!\u2019 \u2018We had our fears,\u2019 Sissy explained, glancing at Louisa, \u2018before yesterday; and when I saw you brought to the side of the litter last night, and heard what passed (being close to Rachael all the time), I went to him when no one saw, and said to him, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. See where your father is. Escape at once, for his sake and your own!\u201d He was in a tremble before I whispered to him, and he started and trembled more then, and said, \u201cWhere can I go? I have very little money, and I don\u2019t know who will hide me!\u201d I thought of father\u2019s old circus. I have not forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this time of year, and I read of him in a paper only the other day. I told him to hurry there, and tell his name, and ask Mr. Sleary to hide him till I came. \u201cI\u2019ll get to him before the morning,\u201d he said. And I saw him shrink away among the people.\u2019 \u2018Thank Heaven!\u2019 exclaimed his father.", " It was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog barking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with his one practicable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions. Soon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a formidable creature) already pinning Bitzer with his eye, and sticking close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight. The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense. At eight o\u2019clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high spirits. \u2018All right, Thquire!\u2019 said Mr. Sleary, \u2018your thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time. Childerth took him off, an hour and a half after we left there latht night. The horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat (he would have walthed if he hadn\u2019t been in harneth), and then I gave him the word and he went to thleep comfortable. When that prethiouth young Rathcal thed he\u2019d go for\u2019ard afoot, the dog hung on to hith neck-hankercher with all four legth in the air and pulled him down and rolled him over.

Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire. Thomas Gradgrind.\u2019 Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse\u2019s card, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel. There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to \u2018go in\u2019 for something else. \u2018My name, sir,\u2019 said his visitor, \u2018is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure he had long expected. \u2018Coketown, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, \u2018is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to. Therefore, if you will allow me\u2014or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man\u2014I\u2019ll tell you something about it before we go any further.\u2019 Mr. Harthouse would be charmed. \u2018Don\u2019t be too sure of that,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I don\u2019t promise it. First of all, you see our smoke. That\u2019s meat and drink to us. It\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the lungs. If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from you. We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear \u2019em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland.\u2019 By way of \u2018going in\u2019 to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, \u2018Mr.", " \u2018She kept a chandler\u2019s shop,\u2019 pursued Bounderby, \u2018and kept me in an egg-box. That was the cot of _my_ infancy; an old egg-box. As soon as I was big enough to run away, of course I ran away. Then I became a young vagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me, everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me. They were right; they had no business to do anything else. I was a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest. I know that very well.\u2019 His pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast. \u2018I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind. Whether I was to do it or not, ma\u2019am, I did it. I pulled through it, though nobody threw me out a rope. Vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk, chief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Those are the antecedents, and the culmination. Josiah Bounderby of Coketown learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the steeple clock of St. Giles\u2019s Church, London, under the direction of a drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant. Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of your district schools and your model schools, and your training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish of schools; and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, tells you plainly, all right, all correct\u2014he hadn\u2019t such advantages\u2014but let us have hard-headed, solid-fisted people\u2014the education that made him won\u2019t do for everybody, he knows well\u2014such and such his education was, however, and you may force him to swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress the facts of his life.\u2019 Being heated when he arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown stopped.", " \u2018Now, you\u2019ll think this pretty well, Harthouse,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018You\u2019ll think this tolerably strong. You\u2019ll say, upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with; but this is nothing, sir! You shall hear me ask this man a question. Pray, Mr. Blackpool\u2019\u2014wind springing up very fast\u2014\u2018may I take the liberty of asking you how it happens that you refused to be in this Combination?\u2019 \u2018How \u2019t happens?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, with his thumbs in the arms of his coat, and jerking his head and shutting his eyes in confidence with the opposite wall: \u2018how it happens.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d leefer not coom to \u2019t, sir; but sin you put th\u2019 question\u2014an\u2019 not want\u2019n t\u2019 be ill-manner\u2019n\u2014I\u2019ll answer. I ha passed a promess.\u2019 \u2018Not to me, you know,\u2019 said Bounderby. (Gusty weather with deceitful calms. One now prevailing.) \u2018O no, sir. Not to yo.\u2019 \u2018As for me, any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it,\u2019 said Bounderby, still in confidence with the wall. \u2018If only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown had been in question, you would have joined and made no bones about it?\u2019 \u2018Why yes, sir. \u2019Tis true.\u2019 \u2018Though he knows,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, now blowing a gale, \u2018that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for! Now, Mr. Harthouse, you have been knocking about in the world some time. Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country?\u2019 And Mr. Bounderby pointed him out for inspection, with an angry finger.", " * * * * * Into how much of futurity? He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily fight at the points of all the weapons in the female armoury, with the grudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting Lady Scadgers, still laid up in bed with her mysterious leg, and gobbling her insufficient income down by about the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a mere closet for one, a mere crib for two; but did he see more? Did he catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers, as the rising young man, so devoted to his master\u2019s great merits, who had won young Tom\u2019s place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when by various rascals he was spirited away? Did he see any faint reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking upon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend a Bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster? Had he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street, and this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile example, little service and much law?"], "How are the trails of smoke that billow from the factory smokestacks described?": [" \u2018It\u2019s ridiculous, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, \u2018because the chances are against the players.\u2019 Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working, or whether it was that her hand was out, she did no work that night. She sat at the window, when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she sat there, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from it, when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward, upward, up to the house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of the factory chimneys, up to the sky. Without a candle in the room, Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her, not thinking much of the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street cries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by, the shutting-up of shop-shutters. Not until the light porter announced that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself from her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrows\u2014by that time creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs. \u2018O, you Fool!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was alone at her supper. Whom she meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the sweetbread. CHAPTER II MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE THE Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces.", " \u2018A dozen year,\u2019 he told her. \u2018I must kiss the hand,\u2019 said she, \u2018that has worked in this fine factory for a dozen year!\u2019 And she lifted it, though he would have prevented her, and put it to her lips. What harmony, besides her age and her simplicity, surrounded her, he did not know, but even in this fantastic action there was a something neither out of time nor place: a something which it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious, or done with such a natural and touching air. He had been at his loom full half an hour, thinking about this old woman, when, having occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment, he glanced through a window which was in his corner, and saw her still looking up at the pile of building, lost in admiration. Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet, and of her two long journeys, she was gazing at it, as if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud music to her. She was gone by and by, and the day went after her, and the lights sprung up again, and the Express whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over the arches near: little felt amid the jarring of the machinery, and scarcely heard above its crash and rattle. Long before then his thoughts had gone back to the dreary room above the little shop, and to the shameful figure heavy on the bed, but heavier on his heart. Machinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse; stopped.", " \u2018It\u2019s all right now, Louisa: it\u2019s all right, young Thomas,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby; \u2018you won\u2019t do so any more. I\u2019ll answer for it\u2019s being all over with father. Well, Louisa, that\u2019s worth a kiss, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 returned Louisa, when she had coldly paused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him, with her face turned away. \u2018Always my pet; ain\u2019t you, Louisa?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Good-bye, Louisa!\u2019 He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red. She was still doing this, five minutes afterwards. \u2018What are you about, Loo?\u2019 her brother sulkily remonstrated. \u2018You\u2019ll rub a hole in your face.\u2019 \u2018You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like, Tom. I wouldn\u2019t cry!\u2019 CHAPTER V THE KEYNOTE COKETOWN, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a triumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself. Let us strike the key-note, Coketown, before pursuing our tune. It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage. It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.", " Consequently, in the first few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood, he even advanced upon his usual display of bustle, and every day made such a rout in renewing his investigations into the robbery, that the officers who had it in hand almost wished it had never been committed. They were at fault too, and off the scent. Although they had been so quiet since the first outbreak of the matter, that most people really did suppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless, nothing new occurred. No implicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying step. More remarkable yet, Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and the mysterious old woman remained a mystery. Things having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it, the upshot of Mr. Bounderby\u2019s investigations was, that he resolved to hazard a bold burst. He drew up a placard, offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool, suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height, and manner, as minutely as he could; he recited how he had left the town, and in what direction he had been last seen going; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow."], "Mrs. Sparsit imagines Louisa's relationship with Harthouse as running down a long staircase into a \"dark pit of ____.\"": [" Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was), and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily. So when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day before her departure, \u2018I tell you what, ma\u2019am; you shall come down here of a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.\u2019 To which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan persuasion: \u2018To hear is to obey.\u2019 Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy, into her head. Much watching of Louisa, and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s edge, must have given her as it were a lift, in the way of inspiration. She erected in her mind a mighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa coming. It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s life, to look up at her staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.", " My injunction is, Keep it quiet, and let it seem to blow over. Do what you like under the rose, but don\u2019t give a sign of what you\u2019re about; or half a hundred of \u2019em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted, out of reach for good. Keep it quiet, and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little, and we shall have \u2019em.\u2019 \u2018Very sagacious indeed, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Very interesting. The old woman you mentioned, sir\u2014\u2019 \u2018The old woman I mentioned, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, cutting the matter short, as it was nothing to boast about, \u2018is not laid hold of; but, she may take her oath she will be, if that is any satisfaction to her villainous old mind. In the mean time, ma\u2019am, I am of opinion, if you ask me my opinion, that the less she is talked about, the better.\u2019 The same evening, Mrs. Sparsit, in her chamber window, resting from her packing operations, looked towards her great staircase and saw Louisa still descending. She sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low; he stood leaning over her, as they whispered together, and his face almost touched her hair. \u2018If not quite!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, straining her hawk\u2019s eyes to the utmost. Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a word of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly, otherwise than from the expression of their figures; but what they said was this: \u2018You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?\u2019 \u2018Oh, perfectly!\u2019 \u2018His face, and his manner, and what he said?\u2019 \u2018Perfectly.", " The member of the fluffy classes was injured, exasperated, left the house grumbling, met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business, went in, put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before, and relieved his mind extremely. Really he would have been an uncommon, instead of a common, fellow, if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity. Or he may have originated it altogether, if he had the cleverness.\u2019 \u2018I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,\u2019 returned Louisa, after sitting thoughtful awhile, \u2018to be so ready to agree with you, and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say.\u2019 \u2018I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse. I have talked it over with my friend Tom more than once\u2014of course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with Tom\u2014and he is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of his. Will you walk?\u2019 They strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the twilight\u2014she leaning on his arm\u2014and she little thought how she was going down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s staircase. Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing. When Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it would; but, until then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s eyes. And there Louisa always was, upon it. And always gliding down, down, down! Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of compunction, all absorbed in interest.", " \u2018He is shooting in Yorkshire,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church, yesterday.\u2019 \u2018The kind of gentleman, now,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, \u2018whom one might wager to be a good shot!\u2019 \u2018Crack,\u2019 said Tom. He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together. Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were so inclined. \u2018Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018as indeed he is of most people. May we expect to see him again shortly, Mr. Tom?\u2019 \u2018Why, _I_ expect to see him to-morrow,\u2019 returned the whelp. \u2018Good news!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, blandly. \u2018I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018and I am going to dine with him afterwards, I believe. He is not coming down to the country house for a week or so, being due somewhere else. At least, he says so; but I shouldn\u2019t wonder if he was to stop here over Sunday, and stray that way.\u2019 \u2018Which reminds me!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Would you remember a message to your sister, Mr. Tom, if I was to charge you with one?\u2019 \u2018Well? I\u2019ll try,\u2019 returned the reluctant whelp, \u2018if it isn\u2019t a long un.\u2019 \u2018It is merely my respectful compliments,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018and I fear I may not trouble her with my society this week; being still a little nervous, and better perhaps by my poor self.\u2019 \u2018Oh!"], "Mr. Gradgrind claims that nothing will ever be of service to children except for ___.": [" \u2018Not a very busy day, my lady. About an average day.\u2019 He now and then slided into my lady, instead of ma\u2019am, as an involuntary acknowledgment of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s personal dignity and claims to reverence. \u2018The clerks,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible crumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, \u2018are trustworthy, punctual, and industrious, of course?\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, pretty fair, ma\u2019am. With the usual exception.\u2019 He held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the establishment, for which volunteer service he received a present at Christmas, over and above his weekly wage. He had grown into an extremely clear-headed, cautious, prudent young man, who was safe to rise in the world. His mind was so exactly regulated, that he had no affections or passions. All his proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest calculation; and it was not without cause that Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him, that he was a young man of the steadiest principle she had ever known. Having satisfied himself, on his father\u2019s death, that his mother had a right of settlement in Coketown, this excellent young economist had asserted that right for her with such a steadfast adherence to the principle of the case, that she had been shut up in the workhouse ever since. It must be admitted that he allowed her half a pound of tea a year, which was weak in him: first, because all gifts have an inevitable tendency to pauperise the recipient, and secondly, because his only reasonable transaction in that commodity would have been to buy it for as little as he could possibly give, and sell it for as much as he could possibly get; it having been clearly ascertained by philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of man\u2014not a part of man\u2019s duty, but the whole.", " With my head in its present state, I couldn\u2019t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the reason!\u2019 pouted Louisa. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s the reason, because it can\u2019t be nothing of the sort,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018Go and be somethingological directly.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit. In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s stock of facts in general was woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position, had been influenced by two reasons. Firstly, she was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had \u2018no nonsense\u2019 about her. By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was. The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact. So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her. \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, \u2018you are always so interested in my young people\u2014particularly in Louisa\u2014that I make no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this discovery.

The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s square wall of a forehead, which had his eyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves, overshadowed by the wall. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s voice, which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s hair, which bristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside.", " A thief!

Because, in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so incomprehensible.\u2019 \u2018Stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility. \u2018You have one of those strollers\u2019 children in the school.\u2019 \u2018Cecilia Jupe, by name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken look at his friend. \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby.", " \u2018No, by the Lord Harry! Nor I!\u2019 \u2018Her father always had it in his head,\u2019 resumed Childers, feigning unconsciousness of Mr. Bounderby\u2019s existence, \u2018that she was to be taught the deuce-and-all of education. How it got into his head, I can\u2019t say; I can only say that it never got out. He has been picking up a bit of reading for her, here\u2014and a bit of writing for her, there\u2014and a bit of ciphering for her, somewhere else\u2014these seven years.\u2019 Mr. E. W. B. Childers took one of his hands out of his pockets, stroked his face and chin, and looked, with a good deal of doubt and a little hope, at Mr. Gradgrind. From the first he had sought to conciliate that gentleman, for the sake of the deserted girl. \u2018When Sissy got into the school here,\u2019 he pursued, \u2018her father was as pleased as Punch. I couldn\u2019t altogether make out why, myself, as we were not stationary here, being but comers and goers anywhere. I suppose, however, he had this move in his mind\u2014he was always half-cracked\u2014and then considered her provided for. If you should happen to have looked in to-night, for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service,\u2019 said Mr. Childers, stroking his face again, and repeating his look, \u2018it would be very fortunate and well-timed; very fortunate and well-timed.\u2019 \u2018On the contrary,\u2019 returned Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018I came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school, and that she must not attend any more.", " This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental. She was so humble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby\u2019s breakfast, before Mrs. Gradgrind\u2014she begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby\u2014she hoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though she trusted to become familiar with it by and by\u2014had assumed her present position. It was only (she observed) because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s time was so very precious, and she knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment, that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his will had been a law to her. \u2018There! Stop where you are, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018stop where you are! Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I believe.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t say that, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity, \u2018because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby. And to be unkind is not to be you, sir.\u2019 \u2018You may set your mind at rest, ma\u2019am.\u2014You can take it very quietly, can\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife. \u2018Of course. It is of no moment. Why should it be of any importance to me?\u2019 \u2018Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight.", " I\u2019ll give _you_ to understand, in reply to that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude\u2014to be summed up in this\u2014that your daughter don\u2019t properly know her husband\u2019s merits, and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her, by George! of the honour of his alliance. That\u2019s plain speaking, I hope.\u2019 \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 urged Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018this is unreasonable.\u2019 \u2018Is it?\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I am glad to hear you say so. Because when Tom Gradgrind, with his new lights, tells me that what I say is unreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible. With your permission I am going on. You know my origin; and you know that for a good many years of my life I didn\u2019t want a shoeing-horn, in consequence of not having a shoe. Yet you may believe or not, as you think proper, that there are ladies\u2014born ladies\u2014belonging to families\u2014Families!\u2014who next to worship the ground I walk on.\u2019 He discharged this like a Rocket, at his father-in-law\u2019s head. \u2018Whereas your daughter,\u2019 proceeded Bounderby, \u2018is far from being a born lady. That you know, yourself. Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff about such things, for you are very well aware I don\u2019t; but that such is the fact, and you, Tom Gradgrind, can\u2019t change it. Why do I say this?\u2019 \u2018Not, I fear,\u2019 observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low voice, \u2018to spare me.\u2019 \u2018Hear me out,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round."], "What is the name of the Gradgrind home?": [" Her remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the drying up of every spring and fountain in her young heart as it gushed out. The golden waters were not there. They were flowing for the fertilization of the land where grapes are gathered from thorns, and figs from thistles. She went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her, into the house and into her mother\u2019s room. Since the time of her leaving home, Sissy had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms. Sissy was at her mother\u2019s side; and Jane, her sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in the room. There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind that her eldest child was there. She reclined, propped up, from mere habit, on a couch: as nearly in her old usual attitude, as anything so helpless could be kept in. She had positively refused to take to her bed; on the ground that if she did, she would never hear the last of it. Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom of a well. The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had been: which had much to do with it. On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she replied, at cross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since he married Louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable name, she had called him J; and that she could not at present depart from that regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.", " Gradgrind,\u2019 said her husband, solemnly, \u2018what do you mean?\u2019 \u2018Whatever I am to call him, Mr. Gradgrind, when he is married to Louisa! I must call him something. It\u2019s impossible,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind, with a mingled sense of politeness and injury, \u2018to be constantly addressing him and never giving him a name. I cannot call him Josiah, for the name is insupportable to me. You yourself wouldn\u2019t hear of Joe, you very well know. Am I to call my own son-in-law, Mister! Not, I believe, unless the time has arrived when, as an invalid, I am to be trampled upon by my relations. Then, what am I to call him!\u2019 Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable emergency, Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being, after delivering the following codicil to her remarks already executed: \u2018As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is,\u2014and I ask it with a fluttering in my chest, which actually extends to the soles of my feet,\u2014that it may take place soon. Otherwise, I know it is one of those subjects I shall never hear the last of.\u2019 When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby, Sissy had suddenly turned her head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in a multitude of emotions, towards Louisa. Louisa had known it, and seen it, without looking at her. From that moment she was impassive, proud and cold\u2014held Sissy at a distance\u2014changed to her altogether. CHAPTER XVI HUSBAND AND WIFE MR. BOUNDERBY\u2019S first disquietude on hearing of his happiness, was occasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit.", " Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too often to believe in them.\u2019 He assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they advanced to meet the whelp. He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along: or he stooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick. He was startled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter pastime, and his colour changed. \u2018Halloa!\u2019 he stammered; \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u2019 \u2018Whose name, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder and turning him, so that they all three walked towards the house together, \u2018have you been carving on the trees?\u2019 \u2018Whose name?\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018Oh! You mean what girl\u2019s name?\u2019 \u2018You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature\u2019s on the bark, Tom.\u2019 [Picture: Mr. Harthouse and Tom Gradgrind in the garden] \u2018Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me. Or she might be as ugly as she was rich, without any fear of losing me. I\u2019d carve her name as often as she liked.\u2019 \u2018I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.\u2019 \u2018Mercenary,\u2019 repeated Tom. \u2018Who is not mercenary? Ask my sister.\u2019 \u2018Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?\u2019 said Louisa, showing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature. \u2018You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,\u2019 returned her brother sulkily. \u2018If it does, you can wear it.\u2019 \u2018Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are now and then,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse.", " I must not only regard myself as being in a very ridiculous position, but as being vanquished at all points. Will you allow me the privilege of remembering my enemy\u2019s name?\u2019 \u2018_My_ name?\u2019 said the ambassadress. \u2018The only name I could possibly care to know, to-night.\u2019 \u2018Sissy Jupe.\u2019 \u2018Pardon my curiosity at parting. Related to the family?\u2019 \u2018I am only a poor girl,\u2019 returned Sissy. \u2018I was separated from my father\u2014he was only a stroller\u2014and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind. I have lived in the house ever since.\u2019 She was gone. \u2018It wanted this to complete the defeat,\u2019 said Mr. James Harthouse, sinking, with a resigned air, on the sofa, after standing transfixed a little while. \u2018The defeat may now be considered perfectly accomplished. Only a poor girl\u2014only a stroller\u2014only James Harthouse made nothing of\u2014only James Harthouse a Great Pyramid of failure.\u2019 The Great Pyramid put it into his head to go up the Nile. He took a pen upon the instant, and wrote the following note (in appropriate hieroglyphics) to his brother: Dear Jack,\u2014All up at Coketown. Bored out of the place, and going in for camels. Affectionately, JEM. He rang the bell. \u2018Send my fellow here.\u2019 \u2018Gone to bed, sir.\u2019 \u2018Tell him to get up, and pack up.\u2019 He wrote two more notes. One, to Mr. Bounderby, announcing his retirement from that part of the country, and showing where he would be found for the next fortnight. The other, similar in effect, to Mr. Gradgrind."], "What does Mr. Gradgrind catch Tom and Luisa spying on?": [" Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer. \u2018A very good fellow indeed!\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018You think so, don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Tom. And shut up his eye again. Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: \u2018What a comical brother-in-law you are!\u2019 \u2018What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\u2019 retorted Mr. James Harthouse. There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. \u2018Oh! I don\u2019t care for old Bounderby,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you mean that.", " Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too often to believe in them.\u2019 He assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they advanced to meet the whelp.

Yes.\u2019 \u2018Not but what I shall be very unwilling, both to leave you, Loo, and to leave you here. But I must go, you know, whether I like it or not; and I had better go where I can take with me some advantage of your influence, than where I should lose it altogether. Don\u2019t you see?\u2019 \u2018Yes, Tom.\u2019 The answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it, that Tom went and leaned on the back of her chair, to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her, from her point of view, and see what he could make of it. \u2018Except that it is a fire,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks. What do you see in it? Not a circus?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t see anything in it, Tom, particularly. But since I have been looking at it, I have been wondering about you and me, grown up.\u2019 \u2018Wondering again!\u2019 said Tom.", " \u2018What is the present need, Tom? Three figures? Out with them. Say what they are.\u2019 \u2018Mr. Harthouse,\u2019 returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were better than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: \u2018it\u2019s too late; the money is of no use to me at present. I should have had it before to be of use to me. But I am very much obliged to you; you\u2019re a true friend.\u2019 A true friend! \u2018Whelp, whelp!\u2019 thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; \u2018what an Ass you are!\u2019 \u2018And I take your offer as a great kindness,\u2019 said Tom, grasping his hand. \u2018As a great kindness, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 returned the other, \u2018it may be of more use by and by. And, my good fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds. \u2018I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Now, you see, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing over a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland: \u2018every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the rest of my fellow-creatures. I am desperately intent;\u2019 the languor of his desperation being quite tropical; \u2018on your softening towards your sister\u2014which you ought to do; and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother\u2014which you ought to be.\u2019 \u2018I will be, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018No time like the present, Tom."], "Mrs. Gradgrind shoos her children away, telling them to, \"go and be ____.\"": [" With my head in its present state, I couldn\u2019t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the reason!\u2019 pouted Louisa. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s the reason, because it can\u2019t be nothing of the sort,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018Go and be somethingological directly.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit. In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s stock of facts in general was woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position, had been influenced by two reasons. Firstly, she was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had \u2018no nonsense\u2019 about her. By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was. The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact. So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her. \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, \u2018you are always so interested in my young people\u2014particularly in Louisa\u2014that I make no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this discovery. I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the education of the reason of my family.", " Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything? Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can have got into the house? Because, in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so incomprehensible.\u2019 \u2018Stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility. \u2018You have one of those strollers\u2019 children in the school.\u2019 \u2018Cecilia Jupe, by name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken look at his friend. \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby.", " \u2018Your foot on the last step, my lady,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing the descending figure, with the aid of her threatening mitten, \u2018and all your art shall never blind me.\u2019 Art or nature though, the original stock of Louisa\u2019s character or the graft of circumstances upon it,\u2014her curious reserve did baffle, while it stimulated, one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit. There were times when Mr. James Harthouse was not sure of her. There were times when he could not read the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of satellites to help her. So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or four days. It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank, adding: \u2018But you\u2019ll go down to-morrow, ma\u2019am, all the same. You\u2019ll go down just as if I was there. It will make no difference to you.\u2019 \u2018Pray, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, \u2018let me beg you not to say that. Your absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as I think you very well know.\u2019 \u2018Well, ma\u2019am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, not displeased. \u2018Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 retorted Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018your will is to me a law, sir; otherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.", " \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward. So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table."], "What is Sissy out buying when her father leaves?": [" It\u2019s as much as he can do to write; and it\u2019s more than people in general can do to read his writing.

As dearly as he loves me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from that time.\u2019 \u2018Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do. When he left me for my good\u2014he never would have left me for his own\u2014I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial. He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back.\u2019 \u2018Tell me more about him,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018I will never ask you again.

But they wouldn\u2019t laugh sometimes, and then father cried. Lately, they very often wouldn\u2019t laugh, and he used to come home despairing. Father\u2019s not like most. Those who didn\u2019t know him as well as I do, and didn\u2019t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right.", " \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth. And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as if he was in pain. And I said, \u201cHave you hurt yourself, father?\u201d (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, \u201cA little, my darling.\u201d And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying. The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first he shook all over, and said nothing but \u201cMy darling;\u201d and \u201cMy love!\u201d\u2019 Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much of that at present.", " And that was wrong, too.\u2019 \u2018Of course it was.\u2019 \u2018Then Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said he would try me once more.

And I find (Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death.

And I said, Miss;\u2019 here Sissy fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest error; \u2018I said it was nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Miss\u2014to the relations and friends of the people who were killed. I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed.", " \u2018I am asking Sissy a few questions, Tom,\u2019 observed his sister. \u2018You have no occasion to go away; but don\u2019t interrupt us for a moment, Tom dear.\u2019 \u2018Oh! very well!\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018Only father has brought old Bounderby home, and I want you to come into the drawing-room.

I said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him, and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there. When I had no more left to tell, he put his arms round my neck, and kissed me a great many times. Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used, for the little hurt he had had, and to get it at the best place, which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after kissing me again, he let me go. When I had gone down-stairs, I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet, and looked in at the door, and said, \u201cFather dear, shall I take Merrylegs?\u201d Father shook his head and said, \u201cNo, Sissy, no; take nothing that\u2019s known to be mine, my darling;\u201d and I left him sitting by the fire."], "Who is the master of the circus?": [" He stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still accompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room. His eminently practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said, \u2018Behold your Bounderby!\u2019 \u2018Well!\u2019 blustered Mr. Bounderby, \u2018what\u2019s the matter? What is young Thomas in the dumps about?\u2019 He spoke of young Thomas, but he looked at Louisa. \u2018We were peeping at the circus,\u2019 muttered Louisa, haughtily, without lifting up her eyes, \u2018and father caught us.\u2019 \u2018And, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said her husband in a lofty manner, \u2018I should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry.\u2019 \u2018Dear me,\u2019 whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018How can you, Louisa and Thomas! I wonder at you. I declare you\u2019re enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all. I have a great mind to say I wish I hadn\u2019t. _Then_ what would you have done, I should like to know?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks. He frowned impatiently. \u2018As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldn\u2019t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of circuses!\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018You know, as well as I do, no young people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend lectures about circuses. What can you possibly want to know of circuses then? I am sure you have enough to do, if that\u2019s what you want.", " With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in her old age. \u2018Well, missus,\u2019 said he, \u2018I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom.

Mr. Sleary was reserved until the last. Opening his arms wide he took her by both her hands, and would have sprung her up and down, after the riding-master manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid act; but there was no rebound in Sissy, and she only stood before him crying. \u2018Good-bye, my dear!\u2019 said Sleary. \u2018You\u2019ll make your fortun, I hope, and none of our poor folkth will ever trouble you, I\u2019ll pound it.

Iron clamps and girders, fire-proof from top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with all their brushes and brooms; everything that heart could desire. Everything? Well, I suppose so. The little Gradgrinds had cabinets in various departments of science too. They had a little conchological cabinet, and a little metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical cabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the bits of stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the parent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names; and, to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper, who had never found his way into their nursery, If the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at more than this, what was it for good gracious goodness\u2019 sake, that the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped it!

He intended every child in it to be a model\u2014just as the young Gradgrinds were all models. There were five young Gradgrinds, and they were models every one. They had been lectured at, from their tenderest years; coursed, like little hares. Almost as soon as they could run alone, they had been made to run to the lecture-room. The first object with which they had an association, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board with a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it. Not that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an Ogre Fact forbid!

If they were more provident and less perverse, ma\u2019am, what would they do? They would say, \u201cWhile my hat covers my family,\u201d or \u201cwhile my bonnet covers my family,\u201d\u2014as the case might be, ma\u2019am\u2014\u201cI have only one to feed, and that\u2019s the person I most like to feed.\u201d\u2019 \u2018To be sure,\u2019 assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin. \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s improving conversation. \u2018Would you wish a little more hot water, ma\u2019am, or is there anything else that I could fetch you?\u2019 \u2018Nothing just now, Bitzer.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am.

That _is_ his knock, ma\u2019am, no doubt.\u2019 He stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again, confirmed himself with, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am.

So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table.", " \u2018Five and thirty, good-looking, good figure, good teeth, good voice, good breeding, well-dressed, dark hair, bold eyes.\u2019 All which Mrs. Sparsit observed in her womanly way\u2014like the Sultan who put his head in the pail of water\u2014merely in dipping down and coming up again. \u2018Please to be seated, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Thank you. Allow me.\u2019 He placed a chair for her, but remained himself carelessly lounging against the table. \u2018I left my servant at the railway looking after the luggage\u2014very heavy train and vast quantity of it in the van\u2014and strolled on, looking about me. Exceedingly odd place. Will you allow me to ask you if it\u2019s _always_ as black as this?\u2019 \u2018In general much blacker,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, in her uncompromising way. \u2018Is it possible! Excuse me: you are not a native, I think?\u2019 \u2018No, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018It was once my good or ill fortune, as it may be\u2014before I became a widow\u2014to move in a very different sphere. My husband was a Powler.\u2019 \u2018Beg your pardon, really!\u2019 said the stranger. \u2018Was\u2014?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit repeated, \u2018A Powler.\u2019 \u2018Powler Family,\u2019 said the stranger, after reflecting a few moments. Mrs. Sparsit signified assent. The stranger seemed a little more fatigued than before. \u2018You must be very much bored here?\u2019 was the inference he drew from the communication. \u2018I am the servant of circumstances, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018and I have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life.\u2019 \u2018Very philosophical,\u2019 returned the stranger, \u2018and very exemplary and laudable, and\u2014\u2019 It seemed to be scarcely worth his while to finish the sentence, so he played with his watch-chain wearily.", " \u2018Pretty fair, ma\u2019am. With the usual exception, ma\u2019am,\u2019 repeated Bitzer. \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her head over her tea-cup, and taking a long gulp. \u2018Mr. Thomas, ma\u2019am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much, ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t like his ways at all.\u2019 \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive manner, \u2018do you recollect my having said anything to you respecting names?\u2019 \u2018I beg your pardon, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s quite true that you did object to names being used, and they\u2019re always best avoided.\u2019 \u2018Please to remember that I have a charge here,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with her air of state. \u2018I hold a trust here, Bitzer, under Mr. Bounderby. However improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago, that he would ever become my patron, making me an annual compliment, I cannot but regard him in that light. From Mr. Bounderby I have received every acknowledgment of my social station, and every recognition of my family descent, that I could possibly expect. More, far more. Therefore, to my patron I will be scrupulously true. And I do not consider, I will not consider, I cannot consider,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, \u2018that I _should_ be scrupulously true, if I allowed names to be mentioned under this roof, that are unfortunately\u2014most unfortunately\u2014no doubt of that\u2014connected with his.\u2019 Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon."], "What does Mrs. Gradgrind claim contradicts the philosophy of fact, and makes her wish she had never been cursed with a family?": [" But you mustn\u2019t fancy,\u2019 cried the gentleman, quite elated by coming so happily to his point. \u2018That\u2019s it! You are never to fancy.\u2019 \u2018You are not, Cecilia Jupe,\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated, \u2018to do anything of that kind.\u2019 \u2018Fact, fact, fact!\u2019 said the gentleman. And \u2018Fact, fact, fact!\u2019 repeated Thomas Gradgrind. \u2018You are to be in all things regulated and governed,\u2019 said the gentleman, \u2018by fact. We hope to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of commissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact, and of nothing but fact. You must discard the word Fancy altogether. You have nothing to do with it. You are not to have, in any object of use or ornament, what would be a contradiction in fact. You don\u2019t walk upon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets. You don\u2019t find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery. You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls. You must use,\u2019 said the gentleman, \u2018for all these purposes, combinations and modifications (in primary colours) of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration. This is the new discovery. This is fact. This is taste.\u2019 The girl curtseyed, and sat down. She was very young, and she looked as if she were frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world afforded.", " Why should they?\u2019 \u2018Because they are improvident,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018that\u2019s where it is. If they were more provident and less perverse, ma\u2019am, what would they do? They would say, \u201cWhile my hat covers my family,\u201d or \u201cwhile my bonnet covers my family,\u201d\u2014as the case might be, ma\u2019am\u2014\u201cI have only one to feed, and that\u2019s the person I most like to feed.\u201d\u2019 \u2018To be sure,\u2019 assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin. \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s improving conversation. \u2018Would you wish a little more hot water, ma\u2019am, or is there anything else that I could fetch you?\u2019 \u2018Nothing just now, Bitzer.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am. I shouldn\u2019t wish to disturb you at your meals, ma\u2019am, particularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,\u2019 said Bitzer, craning a little to look over into the street from where he stood; \u2018but there\u2019s a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, ma\u2019am, and he has come across as if he was going to knock. That _is_ his knock, ma\u2019am, no doubt.\u2019 He stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again, confirmed himself with, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am. Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in, ma\u2019am?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know who it can be,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping her mouth and arranging her mittens. \u2018A stranger, ma\u2019am, evidently.\u2019 \u2018What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless he comes upon some business for which he is too late, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr. Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it.", " The solitary exception was the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door, terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs. All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe characters of black and white. The jail might have been the infirmary, the infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been either, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction. Fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the immaterial. The M\u2019Choakumchild school was all fact, and the school of design was all fact, and the relations between master and man were all fact, and everything was fact between the lying-in hospital and the cemetery, and what you couldn\u2019t state in figures, or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest, was not, and never should be, world without end, Amen. A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course got on well? Why no, not quite well. No? Dear me! No. Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in all respects like gold that had stood the fire. First, the perplexing mystery of the place was, Who belonged to the eighteen denominations? Because, whoever did, the labouring people did not. It was very strange to walk through the streets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of _them_ the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away from their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of their own streets, where they lounged listlessly, gazing at all the church and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern.", " Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth, but with uncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in them, analogous to the changes on a blind face groping its way. She was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no distant day would seem to become a woman all at once. Her father thought so as he looked at her. She was pretty. Would have been self-willed (he thought in his eminently practical way) but for her bringing-up. \u2018Thomas, though I have the fact before me, I find it difficult to believe that you, with your education and resources, should have brought your sister to a scene like this.\u2019 \u2018I brought _him_, father,\u2019 said Louisa, quickly. \u2018I asked him to come.\u2019 \u2018I am sorry to hear it. I am very sorry indeed to hear it. It makes Thomas no better, and it makes you worse, Louisa.\u2019 She looked at her father again, but no tear fell down her cheek. \u2018You! Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; Thomas and you, who may be said to be replete with facts; Thomas and you, who have been trained to mathematical exactness; Thomas and you, here!\u2019 cried Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018In this degraded position! I am amazed.\u2019 \u2018I was tired, father. I have been tired a long time,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Tired? Of what?\u2019 asked the astonished father. \u2018I don\u2019t know of what\u2014of everything, I think.\u2019 \u2018Say not another word,\u2019 returned Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018You are childish. I will hear no more.\u2019 He did not speak again until they had walked some half-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with: \u2018What would your best friends say, Louisa?"], "Who convinces Sissy to talk about her father?": [" \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth. And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as if he was in pain. And I said, \u201cHave you hurt yourself, father?\u201d (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, \u201cA little, my darling.\u201d And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying. The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first he shook all over, and said nothing but \u201cMy darling;\u201d and \u201cMy love!\u201d\u2019 Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much of that at present.", " It\u2019s as much as he can do to write; and it\u2019s more than people in general can do to read his writing.

She was;\u2019 Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; \u2018she was a dancer.\u2019 \u2018Did your father love her?\u2019 Louisa asked these questions with a strong, wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and hiding in solitary places. \u2018O yes! As dearly as he loves me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from that time.\u2019 \u2018Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do. When he left me for my good\u2014he never would have left me for his own\u2014I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial. He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back.\u2019 \u2018Tell me more about him,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018I will never ask you again.

Father\u2019s a;\u2019 Sissy whispered the awful word, \u2018a clown.\u2019 \u2018To make the people laugh?\u2019 said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence. \u2018Yes. But they wouldn\u2019t laugh sometimes, and then father cried. Lately, they very often wouldn\u2019t laugh, and he used to come home despairing. Father\u2019s not like most. Those who didn\u2019t know him as well as I do, and didn\u2019t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right.", " \u2018How was what done?\u2019 moodily answered the son. \u2018This robbery,\u2019 said the father, raising his voice upon the word. \u2018I forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up ajar before I went away. I had had the key that was found, made long before. I dropped it that morning, that it might be supposed to have been used. I didn\u2019t take the money all at once. I pretended to put my balance away every night, but I didn\u2019t. Now you know all about it.\u2019 \u2018If a thunderbolt had fallen on me,\u2019 said the father, \u2018it would have shocked me less than this!\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t see why,\u2019 grumbled the son. \u2018So many people are employed in situations of trust; so many people, out of so many, will be dishonest. I have heard you talk, a hundred times, of its being a law. How can _I_ help laws? You have comforted others with such things, father. Comfort yourself!\u2019 The father buried his face in his hands, and the son stood in his disgraceful grotesqueness, biting straw: his hands, with the black partly worn away inside, looking like the hands of a monkey. The evening was fast closing in; and from time to time, he turned the whites of his eyes restlessly and impatiently towards his father. They were the only parts of his face that showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was so thick. \u2018You must be got to Liverpool, and sent abroad.\u2019 \u2018I suppose I must.

I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed."], "What is Stephen Blackpool's job at the factory?": [" In another moment, he stood as he had stood all the time\u2014his usual stoop upon him; his pondering face addressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half shrewd, half perplexed, as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very difficult; his hat held tight in his left hand, which rested on his hip; his right arm, with a rugged propriety and force of action, very earnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so when it always paused, a little bent, but not withdrawn, as he paused. \u2018I was acquainted with all this, you know,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018except the last clause, long ago. It\u2019s a bad job; that\u2019s what it is. You had better have been satisfied as you were, and not have got married. However, it\u2019s too late to say that.\u2019 \u2018Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of years?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018You hear what this lady asks. Was it an unequal marriage in point of years, this unlucky job of yours?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Not e\u2019en so. I were one-and-twenty myseln; she were twenty nighbut.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, sir?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief, with great placidity. \u2018I inferred, from its being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an unequal one in point of years.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that had an odd sheepishness about it. He fortified himself with a little more sherry. \u2018Well? Why don\u2019t you go on?\u2019 he then asked, turning rather irritably on Stephen Blackpool.", " \u2018I ha never thowt yet, missus,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018o\u2019 askin thy name.\u2019 The old lady announced herself as \u2018Mrs. Pegler.\u2019 \u2018A widder, I think?\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Oh, many long years!\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s husband (one of the best on record) was already dead, by Mrs. Pegler\u2019s calculation, when Stephen was born. \u2018\u2019Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Onny children?\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted some nervousness on her part. \u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018Not now, not now.\u2019 \u2018Dead, Stephen,\u2019 Rachael softly hinted. \u2018I\u2019m sooary I ha spok\u2019n on \u2019t,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018I ought t\u2019 hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place. I\u2014I blame myseln.\u2019 While he excused himself, the old lady\u2019s cup rattled more and more. \u2018I had a son,\u2019 she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; \u2018and he did well, wonderfully well. But he is not to be spoken of if you please. He is\u2014\u2019 Putting down her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have added, by her action, \u2018dead!\u2019 Then she said aloud, \u2018I have lost him.\u2019 Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear. Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was uttered. \u2018Bounderby!\u2019 she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. \u2018Oh hide me!", " The lights were turned out, and the work went on. The rain fell, and the Smoke-serpents, submissive to the curse of all that tribe, trailed themselves upon the earth. In the waste-yard outside, the steam from the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the shining heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of mist and rain. The work went on, until the noon-bell rang. More clattering upon the pavements. The looms, and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour. Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets, haggard and worn. He turned from his own class and his own quarter, taking nothing but a little bread as he walked along, towards the hill on which his principal employer lived, in a red house with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps, BOUNDERBY (in letters very like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop. Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch. So Stephen had expected. Would his servant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him? Message in return, requiring name of such Hand. Stephen Blackpool. There was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might come in. Stephen Blackpool in the parlour. Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by sight), at lunch on chop and sherry. Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup.", " Consequently, in the first few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood, he even advanced upon his usual display of bustle, and every day made such a rout in renewing his investigations into the robbery, that the officers who had it in hand almost wished it had never been committed. They were at fault too, and off the scent. Although they had been so quiet since the first outbreak of the matter, that most people really did suppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless, nothing new occurred. No implicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying step. More remarkable yet, Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and the mysterious old woman remained a mystery. Things having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it, the upshot of Mr. Bounderby\u2019s investigations was, that he resolved to hazard a bold burst. He drew up a placard, offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool, suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height, and manner, as minutely as he could; he recited how he had left the town, and in what direction he had been last seen going; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow."], "What is the term used for the lowest menial laborers in Coketown?": [" Sometimes they played tricks upon him; but they never knew how he felt them, and shrunk up, when he was alone with me. He was far, far timider than they thought!\u2019 \u2018And you were his comfort through everything?\u2019 She nodded, with the tears rolling down her face. \u2018I hope so, and father said I was. It was because he grew so scared and trembling, and because he felt himself to be a poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to be his words), that he wanted me so much to know a great deal, and be different from him. I used to read to him to cheer his courage, and he was very fond of that. They were wrong books\u2014I am never to speak of them here\u2014but we didn\u2019t know there was any harm in them.\u2019 \u2018And he liked them?\u2019 said Louisa, with a searching gaze on Sissy all this time. \u2018O very much! They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm. And often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or would have her head cut off before it was finished.\u2019 \u2018And your father was always kind? To the last?\u2019 asked Louisa contravening the great principle, and wondering very much. \u2018Always, always!\u2019 returned Sissy, clasping her hands. \u2018Kinder and kinder than I can tell. He was angry only one night, and that was not to me, but Merrylegs. Merrylegs;\u2019 she whispered the awful fact; \u2018is his performing dog.\u2019 \u2018Why was he angry with the dog?\u2019 Louisa demanded.", " The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no existence, properly viewed\u2014really no existence\u2014but it is no compliment to you to say, that you know better. Now, what are the Facts of this case? You are, we will say in round numbers, twenty years of age; Mr. Bounderby is, we will say in round numbers, fifty. There is some disparity in your respective years, but in your means and positions there is none; on the contrary, there is a great suitability. Then the question arises, Is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage? In considering this question, it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage, so far as they have yet been obtained, in England and Wales. I find, on reference to the figures, that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages, and that the elder of these contracting parties is, in rather more than three-fourths of these instances, the bridegroom. It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the British possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and among the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers, yield similar results. The disparity I have mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all but disappears.\u2019 \u2018What do you recommend, father,\u2019 asked Louisa, her reserved composure not in the least affected by these gratifying results, \u2018that I should substitute for the term I used just now?", " He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he came into it, and spent it twice over immediately afterwards. Thus, when he died, at twenty-four (the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he did not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the honeymoon, in affluent circumstances. That bereaved lady, fifteen years older than he, fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative, Lady Scadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly to maintain herself, went out at a salary. And here she was now, in her elderly days, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby\u2019s tea as he took his breakfast. If Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess whom he took about as a feature in his state-processions, he could not have made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did. Just as it belonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction, so it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s. In the measure that he would not allow his own youth to have been attended by a single favourable circumstance, he brightened Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s juvenile career with every possible advantage, and showered waggon-loads of early roses all over that lady\u2019s path. \u2018And yet, sir,\u2019 he would say, \u2018how does it turn out after all? Why here she is at a hundred a year (I give her a hundred, which she is pleased to term handsome), keeping the house of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown!\u2019 Nay, he made this foil of his so very widely known, that third parties took it up, and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness.", " Though I do not mean to say but that my feelings may be weaker on such points\u2014more foolish if the term is preferred\u2014than they might have been, if I had always occupied my present position.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse, as much as to say, \u2018I am the proprietor of this female, and she\u2019s worth your attention, I think.\u2019 Then, resumed his discourse. \u2018You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to him when you saw him. I didn\u2019t mince the matter with him. I am never mealy with \u2019em. I KNOW \u2019em. Very well, sir. Three days after that, he bolted. Went off, nobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancy\u2014only with this difference, that he is a worse subject than my mother, if possible. What did he do before he went? What do you say;\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, with his hat in his hand, gave a beat upon the crown at every little division of his sentences, as if it were a tambourine; \u2018to his being seen\u2014night after night\u2014watching the Bank?\u2014to his lurking about there\u2014after dark?\u2014To its striking Mrs. Sparsit\u2014that he could be lurking for no good\u2014To her calling Bitzer\u2019s attention to him, and their both taking notice of him\u2014And to its appearing on inquiry to-day\u2014that he was also noticed by the neighbours?\u2019 Having come to the climax, Mr. Bounderby, like an oriental dancer, put his tambourine on his head. \u2018Suspicious,\u2019 said James Harthouse, \u2018certainly.\u2019 \u2018I think so, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, with a defiant nod."], "According to Bounderby, who are the only people who can receive divorces?": [" I couldn\u2019t meet wi\u2019 Mr. Bounderby then, and your brother sent me away, and I tried to find you, but you was not to be found, and I went back to work. Soon as I come out of the Mill to-night, I hastened to hear what was said of Stephen\u2014for I know wi\u2019 pride he will come back to shame it!\u2014and then I went again to seek Mr. Bounderby, and I found him, and I told him every word I knew; and he believed no word I said, and brought me here.\u2019 \u2018So far, that\u2019s true enough,\u2019 assented Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets and his hat on. \u2018But I have known you people before to-day, you\u2019ll observe, and I know you never die for want of talking. Now, I recommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as doing. You have undertaken to do something; all I remark upon that at present is, do it!\u2019 \u2018I have written to Stephen by the post that went out this afternoon, as I have written to him once before sin\u2019 he went away,\u2019 said Rachael; \u2018and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.\u2019 \u2018Then, I\u2019ll tell you something. You are not aware perhaps,\u2019 retorted Mr. Bounderby, \u2018that you yourself have been looked after now and then, not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business, on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep. The post-office hasn\u2019t been forgotten either. What I\u2019ll tell you is, that no letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it. Therefore, what has become of yours, I leave you to guess.", " \u2018Come!\u2019 said he, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be told about that. I know what I took her for, as well as you do. Never you mind what I took her for; that\u2019s my look out.\u2019 \u2018I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa.\u2019 \u2018I think differently,\u2019 blustered Bounderby. \u2018I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions. Now, I don\u2019t want to make a quarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind. To tell you the truth, I don\u2019t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject. As to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes best. If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don\u2019t fall in my way, I shan\u2019t, for it won\u2019t be worth my while to do it. As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don\u2019t come home to-morrow, by twelve o\u2019clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you\u2019ll take charge of her for the future. What I shall say to people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this. I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she\u2019s the daughter of Tom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn\u2019t pull together.", " And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be. Lengthy and prosy in the extreme. It was knowing to hold forth, in the humble-virtue school of eloquence; but, I assure you I thought at the time, \u201cMy good fellow, you are over-doing this!\u201d\u2019 \u2018It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man.\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa\u2014as Tom says.\u2019 Which he never did say. \u2018You know no good of the fellow?\u2019 \u2018No, certainly.\u2019 \u2018Nor of any other such person?\u2019 \u2018How can I,\u2019 she returned, with more of her first manner on her than he had lately seen, \u2018when I know nothing of them, men or women?\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend, who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow-creatures\u2014for excellent they are, I am quite ready to believe, in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of. This fellow talks. Well; every fellow talks. He professes morality. Well; all sorts of humbugs profess morality. From the House of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general profession of morality, except among our people; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving. You saw and heard the case. Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby\u2014who, as we know, is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand.", " \u2018Ith an internal thame, upon my thoul it ith,\u2019 said Sleary. \u2018O my dear father, my good kind father, where are you gone? You are gone to try to do me some good, I know! You are gone away for my sake, I am sure! And how miserable and helpless you will be without me, poor, poor father, until you come back!\u2019 It was so pathetic to hear her saying many things of this kind, with her face turned upward, and her arms stretched out as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow and embrace it, that no one spoke a word until Mr. Bounderby (growing impatient) took the case in hand. \u2018Now, good people all,\u2019 said he, \u2018this is wanton waste of time. Let the girl understand the fact. Let her take it from me, if you like, who have been run away from, myself. Here, what\u2019s your name! Your father has absconded\u2014deserted you\u2014and you mustn\u2019t expect to see him again as long as you live.\u2019 They cared so little for plain Fact, these people, and were in that advanced state of degeneracy on the subject, that instead of being impressed by the speaker\u2019s strong common sense, they took it in extraordinary dudgeon. The men muttered \u2018Shame!\u2019 and the women \u2018Brute!\u2019 and Sleary, in some haste, communicated the following hint, apart to Mr. Bounderby. \u2018I tell you what, Thquire. To thpeak plain to you, my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort, and drop it. They\u2019re a very good natur\u2019d people, my people, but they\u2019re accuthtomed to be quick in their movementh; and if you don\u2019t act upon my advithe, I\u2019m damned if I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll pith you out o\u2019 winder.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion, Mr. Gradgrind found an opening for his eminently practical exposition of the subject."], "The strange old woman outside Bounderby's house tells Stephen that she visits there once every ___.": [" \u2018Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with you,\u2019 said the old woman, cheerfully, taking the reply upon herself. \u2018My visiting time is later this year than usual, for I have been rather troubled with shortness of breath, and so put it off till the weather was fine and warm. For the same reason I don\u2019t make all my journey in one day, but divide it into two days, and get a bed to-night at the Travellers\u2019 Coffee House down by the railroad (a nice clean house), and go back Parliamentary, at six in the morning. Well, but what has this to do with this good lass, says you? I\u2019m going to tell you. I have heard of Mr. Bounderby being married. I read it in the paper, where it looked grand\u2014oh, it looked fine!\u2019 the old woman dwelt on it with strange enthusiasm: \u2018and I want to see his wife. I have never seen her yet. Now, if you\u2019ll believe me, she hasn\u2019t come out of that house since noon to-day. So not to give her up too easily, I was waiting about, a little last bit more, when I passed close to this good lass two or three times; and her face being so friendly I spoke to her, and she spoke to me. There!\u2019 said the old woman to Stephen, \u2018you can make all the rest out for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!\u2019 Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike this old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly could be.", " \u2018Pray, sir,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018didn\u2019t I see you come out of that gentleman\u2019s house?\u2019 pointing back to Mr. Bounderby\u2019s. \u2018I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?\u2019 \u2018Yes, missus,\u2019 returned Stephen, \u2018it were me.\u2019 \u2018Have you\u2014you\u2019ll excuse an old woman\u2019s curiosity\u2014have you seen the gentleman?\u2019 \u2018Yes, missus.\u2019 \u2018And how did he look, sir? Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?\u2019 As she straightened her own figure, and held up her head in adapting her action to her words, the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old woman before, and had not quite liked her. \u2018O yes,\u2019 he returned, observing her more attentively, \u2018he were all that.\u2019 \u2018And healthy,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018as the fresh wind?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 returned Stephen. \u2018He were ett\u2019n and drinking\u2014as large and as loud as a Hummobee.\u2019 \u2018Thank you!\u2019 said the old woman, with infinite content. \u2018Thank you!\u2019 He certainly never had seen this old woman before. Yet there was a vague remembrance in his mind, as if he had more than once dreamed of some old woman like her. She walked along at his side, and, gently accommodating himself to her humour, he said Coketown was a busy place, was it not? To which she answered \u2018Eigh sure! Dreadful busy!\u2019 Then he said, she came from the country, he saw? To which she answered in the affirmative. \u2018By Parliamentary, this morning. I came forty mile by Parliamentary this morning, and I\u2019m going back the same forty mile this afternoon.", " the old woman said, quickening hers, too, quite easily. Yes, time was nearly out. On his telling her where he worked, the old woman became a more singular old woman than before. \u2018An\u2019t you happy?\u2019 she asked him. \u2018Why\u2014there\u2019s awmost nobbody but has their troubles, missus.\u2019 He answered evasively, because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he would be very happy indeed, and he had not the heart to disappoint her. He knew that there was trouble enough in the world; and if the old woman had lived so long, and could count upon his having so little, why so much the better for her, and none the worse for him. \u2018Ay, ay! You have your troubles at home, you mean?\u2019 she said. \u2018Times. Just now and then,\u2019 he answered, slightly. \u2018But, working under such a gentleman, they don\u2019t follow you to the Factory?\u2019 No, no; they didn\u2019t follow him there, said Stephen. All correct there. Everything accordant there. (He did not go so far as to say, for her pleasure, that there was a sort of Divine Right there; but, I have heard claims almost as magnificent of late years.) They were now in the black by-road near the place, and the Hands were crowding in. The bell was ringing, and the Serpent was a Serpent of many coils, and the Elephant was getting ready. The strange old woman was delighted with the very bell. It was the beautifullest bell she had ever heard, she said, and sounded grand! She asked him, when he stopped good-naturedly to shake hands with her before going in, how long he had worked there?", " There\u2019s an English family with a charming Italian motto. What will be, will be. It\u2019s the only truth going!\u2019 This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty\u2014a vice so dangerous, so deadly, and so common\u2014seemed, he observed, a little to impress her in his favour. He followed up the advantage, by saying in his pleasantest manner: a manner to which she might attach as much or as little meaning as she pleased: \u2018The side that can prove anything in a line of units, tens, hundreds, and thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford the most fun, and to give a man the best chance. I am quite as much attached to it as if I believed it. I am quite ready to go in for it, to the same extent as if I believed it. And what more could I possibly do, if I did believe it!\u2019 \u2018You are a singular politician,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Pardon me; I have not even that merit. We are the largest party in the state, I assure you, Mrs. Bounderby, if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed here with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six, and taking Mr. James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to the voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity. The round of visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet use of his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a considerable accession of boredom."], "When Stephen sees his wife about to take a lethal dose of medicine what does he do?": [" There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms, whether native or foreign, and all about it. The bridesmaids, down to little Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of the company. After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness, I suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and know what I am, and what my extraction was, you won\u2019t expect a speech from a man who, when he sees a Post, says \u201cthat\u2019s a Post,\u201d and when he sees a Pump, says \u201cthat\u2019s a Pump,\u201d and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick. If you want a speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it. I am not your man. However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused.", " \u2018Then go straight up there, will you?\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018You\u2019re expected, and have only to tell the servant it\u2019s you. I belong to the Bank; so, if you go straight up without me (I was sent to fetch you), you\u2019ll save me a walk.\u2019 Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby. CHAPTER V MEN AND MASTERS \u2018WELL, Stephen,\u2019 said Bounderby, in his windy manner, \u2018what\u2019s this I hear? What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_? Come in, and speak up.\u2019 It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden. A tea-table was set out; and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s young wife, and her brother, and a great gentleman from London, were present. To whom Stephen made his obeisance, closing the door and standing near it, with his hat in his hand. \u2018This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. The gentleman he addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa, got up, saying in an indolent way, \u2018Oh really?\u2019 and dawdled to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood. \u2018Now,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018speak up!\u2019 After the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and discordantly on Stephen\u2019s ear. Besides being a rough handling of his wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested deserter he had been called. \u2018What were it, sir,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018as yo were pleased to want wi\u2019 me?\u2019 \u2018Why, I have told you,\u2019 returned Bounderby.", " With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in her old age. \u2018Well, missus,\u2019 said he, \u2018I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom. Wi\u2019 fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha never seen the like on.\u2019 \u2018Young and handsome. Yes!\u2019 cried the old woman, quite delighted. \u2018As bonny as a rose! And what a happy wife!\u2019 \u2018Aye, missus, I suppose she be,\u2019 said Stephen. But with a doubtful glance at Rachael. \u2018Suppose she be? She must be. She\u2019s your master\u2019s wife,\u2019 returned the old woman. Stephen nodded assent. \u2018Though as to master,\u2019 said he, glancing again at Rachael, \u2018not master onny more. That\u2019s aw enden \u2019twixt him and me.\u2019 \u2018Have you left his work, Stephen?\u2019 asked Rachael, anxiously and quickly. \u2018Why, Rachael,\u2019 he replied, \u2018whether I ha lef\u2019n his work, or whether his work ha lef\u2019n me, cooms t\u2019 th\u2019 same. His work and me are parted. \u2019Tis as weel so\u2014better, I were thinkin when yo coom up wi\u2019 me. It would ha brought\u2019n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer. Haply \u2019tis a kindness to monny that I go; haply \u2019tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it mun be done. I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th\u2019 time, and seek a fort\u2019n, dear, by beginnin fresh.\u2019 \u2018Where will you go, Stephen?\u2019 \u2018I donno t\u2019night,\u2019 said he, lifting off his hat, and smoothing his thin hair with the flat of his hand. \u2018But I\u2019m not goin t\u2019night, Rachael, nor yet t\u2019morrow.", " Don\u2019t let me be seen for the world. Don\u2019t let him come up till I\u2019ve got away. Pray, pray!\u2019 She trembled, and was excessively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to reassure her; and not seeming to know what she was about. \u2018But hearken, missus, hearken,\u2019 said Stephen, astonished. \u2018\u2019Tisn\u2019t Mr. Bounderby; \u2019tis his wife. Yo\u2019r not fearfo\u2019 o\u2019 her. Yo was hey-go-mad about her, but an hour sin.\u2019 \u2018But are you sure it\u2019s the lady, and not the gentleman?\u2019 she asked, still trembling. \u2018Certain sure!\u2019 \u2018Well then, pray don\u2019t speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,\u2019 said the old woman. \u2018Let me be quite to myself in this corner.\u2019 Stephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explanation, which she was quite unable to give him; took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few moments returned, lighting Louisa into the room. She was followed by the whelp. Rachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand, when Stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle on the table. Then he too stood, with his doubled hand upon the table near it, waiting to be addressed. For the first time in her life Louisa had come into one of the dwellings of the Coketown Hands; for the first time in her life she was face to face with anything like individuality in connection with them. She knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands. She knew what results in work a given number of them would produce in a given space of time."], "What position does Mr. Gradgrind take?": [" This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental. She was so humble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby\u2019s breakfast, before Mrs. Gradgrind\u2014she begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby\u2014she hoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though she trusted to become familiar with it by and by\u2014had assumed her present position. It was only (she observed) because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s time was so very precious, and she knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment, that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his will had been a law to her. \u2018There! Stop where you are, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018stop where you are! Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I believe.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t say that, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity, \u2018because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby. And to be unkind is not to be you, sir.\u2019 \u2018You may set your mind at rest, ma\u2019am.\u2014You can take it very quietly, can\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife. \u2018Of course. It is of no moment. Why should it be of any importance to me?\u2019 \u2018Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight.", " With my head in its present state, I couldn\u2019t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the reason!\u2019 pouted Louisa. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s the reason, because it can\u2019t be nothing of the sort,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018Go and be somethingological directly.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit. In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s stock of facts in general was woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position, had been influenced by two reasons. Firstly, she was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had \u2018no nonsense\u2019 about her. By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was. The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact. So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her. \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, \u2018you are always so interested in my young people\u2014particularly in Louisa\u2014that I make no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this discovery. I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the education of the reason of my family.", " \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward. So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table.", " Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.\u2019 Silence between them. The deadly statistical clock very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy. \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question. \u2018Well, my child,\u2019 he returned, \u2018I\u2014really\u2014cannot take upon myself to say.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, \u2018do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa, no. No. I ask nothing.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 she still pursued, \u2018does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?\u2019 \u2018Really, my dear,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018it is difficult to answer your question\u2014\u2019 \u2018Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father? \u2018Certainly, my dear. Because;\u2019 here was something to demonstrate, and it set him up again; \u2018because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on the sense in which we use the expression. Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice, and does not do himself the injustice, of pretending to anything fanciful, fantastic, or (I am using synonymous terms) sentimental. Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his eyes, to very little purpose, if he could so far forget what is due to your good sense, not to say to his, as to address you from any such ground. Therefore, perhaps the expression itself\u2014I merely suggest this to you, my dear\u2014may be a little misplaced.\u2019 \u2018What would you advise me to use in its stead, father?\u2019 \u2018Why, my dear Louisa,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, completely recovered by this time, \u2018I would advise you (since you ask me) to consider this question, as you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as one of tangible Fact."], "When Tom becomes an apprentice at the bank, who does he live with?": [" \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you\u2019ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I\u2019ll mention it. Never mind a light, man!\u2019 Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. \u2018It don\u2019t want a light.\u2019 Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand. \u2018I say!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I think I can do you a good turn. Don\u2019t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there\u2019s no harm in my trying.\u2019 His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\u2019s ear, it was so hot. \u2018That was our light porter at the Bank,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018who brought you the message to-night. I call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.\u2019 Stephen thought, \u2018What a hurry he is in!\u2019 He spoke so confusedly. \u2018Well!\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! When are you off?\u2019 \u2018T\u2019 day\u2019s Monday,\u2019 replied Stephen, considering. \u2018Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh \u2019bout.\u2019 \u2018Friday or Saturday,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you\u2014that\u2019s my sister, you know, in your room\u2014but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there\u2019s no harm done. So I tell you what. You\u2019ll know our light porter again?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sure,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Very well,\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018When you leave work of a night, between this and your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?", " \u2018Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told her! Never knew her do such a thing before. Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!\u2019 She still looked faint and pale. James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed. \u2018Why, I am going to tell you,\u2019 said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you before. You know this lady (for she _is_ a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?\u2019 \u2018I have already had the honour\u2014\u2019 \u2018Very well. And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him too on the same occasion?\u2019 Mr. Harthouse inclined his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead. \u2018Very well. They live at the Bank. You know they live at the Bank, perhaps? Very well. Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything was put away as usual. In the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much. In the little safe in young Tom\u2019s closet, the safe used for petty purposes, there was a hundred and fifty odd pound.\u2019 \u2018A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Come!\u2019 retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him, \u2018let\u2019s have none of _your_ interruptions. It\u2019s enough to be robbed while you\u2019re snoring because you\u2019re too comfortable, without being put right with _your_ four seven ones.", " Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer. \u2018A very good fellow indeed!\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018You think so, don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Tom. And shut up his eye again. Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: \u2018What a comical brother-in-law you are!\u2019 \u2018What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\u2019 retorted Mr. James Harthouse. There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. \u2018Oh! I don\u2019t care for old Bounderby,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you mean that.", " However, when I go to live with old Bounderby, I\u2019ll have my revenge.\u2019 \u2018Your revenge, Tom?\u2019 \u2018I mean, I\u2019ll enjoy myself a little, and go about and see something, and hear something. I\u2019ll recompense myself for the way in which I have been brought up.\u2019 \u2018But don\u2019t disappoint yourself beforehand, Tom. Mr. Bounderby thinks as father thinks, and is a great deal rougher, and not half so kind.\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said Tom, laughing; \u2018I don\u2019t mind that. I shall very well know how to manage and smooth old Bounderby!\u2019 Their shadows were defined upon the wall, but those of the high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling, as if the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern. Or, a fanciful imagination\u2014if such treason could have been there\u2014might have made it out to be the shadow of their subject, and of its lowering association with their future. \u2018What is your great mode of smoothing and managing, Tom? Is it a secret?\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said Tom, \u2018if it is a secret, it\u2019s not far off. It\u2019s you. You are his little pet, you are his favourite; he\u2019ll do anything for you. When he says to me what I don\u2019t like, I shall say to him, \u201cMy sister Loo will be hurt and disappointed, Mr. Bounderby. She always used to tell me she was sure you would be easier with me than this.\u201d That\u2019ll bring him about, or nothing will.\u2019 After waiting for some answering remark, and getting none, Tom wearily relapsed into the present time, and twined himself yawning round and about the rails of his chair, and rumpled his head more and more, until he suddenly looked up, and asked: \u2018Have you gone to sleep, Loo?\u2019 \u2018No, Tom."], "Louisa is sure that she does not love Mr. Bounderby, but she agrees to marry him anyway, because, as she says ____.": [" Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.\u2019 Silence between them.

Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive you as I do!\u2019 The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone. But, when Louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh. \u2018Not you. I don\u2019t want to have anything to say to you!\u2019 \u2018O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!\u2019 \u2018After all your love!\u2019 he returned, obdurately. \u2018Pretty love! Leaving old Bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and going home just when I was in the greatest danger. Pretty love that! Coming out with every word about our having gone to that place, when you saw the net was gathering round me. Pretty love that! You have regularly given me up. You never cared for me.\u2019 \u2018Tharp\u2019th the word!\u2019 said Sleary, at the door. They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him that she forgave him, and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one ran against them. Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both before him while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled. For, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when other people ran themselves into a glow.", " For the misplaced expression?\u2019 \u2018Louisa,\u2019 returned her father, \u2018it appears to me that nothing can be plainer. Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him? Yes, he does. The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him? I think nothing can be plainer than that?\u2019 \u2018Shall I marry him?\u2019 repeated Louisa, with great deliberation. \u2018Precisely. And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear Louisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that belong to many young women.\u2019 \u2018No, father,\u2019 she returned, \u2018I do not.\u2019 \u2018I now leave you to judge for yourself,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018I have stated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds; I have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time. The rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to decide.\u2019 From the beginning, she had sat looking at him fixedly. As he now leaned back in his chair, and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn, perhaps he might have seen one wavering moment in her, when she was impelled to throw herself upon his breast, and give him the pent-up confidences of her heart. But, to see it, he must have overleaped at a bound the artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting, between himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will elude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be sounded shall blow even algebra to wreck.", " What does it matter?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words; replying, \u2018How, matter? What matter, my dear?\u2019 \u2018Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding this, \u2018asks me to marry him. The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him? That is so, father, is it not? You have told me so, father. Have you not?\u2019 \u2018Certainly, my dear.\u2019 \u2018Let it be so. Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus, I am satisfied to accept his proposal. Tell him, father, as soon as you please, that this was my answer. Repeat it, word for word, if you can, because I should wish him to know what I said.\u2019 \u2018It is quite right, my dear,\u2019 retorted her father approvingly, \u2018to be exact. I will observe your very proper request. Have you any wish in reference to the period of your marriage, my child?\u2019 \u2018None, father. What does it matter!\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind had drawn his chair a little nearer to her, and taken her hand. But, her repetition of these words seemed to strike with some little discord on his ear. He paused to look at her, and, still holding her hand, said: \u2018Louisa, I have not considered it essential to ask you one question, because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote. But perhaps I ought to do so. You have never entertained in secret any other proposal?\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 she returned, almost scornfully, \u2018what other proposal can have been made to _me_?"], "Why does Mr. Bounderby want to take his honeymoon in Lyons?": [" So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don\u2019t, I can\u2019t help it. I _do_ feel independent. Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter. I am very glad to be so. It has long been my wish to be so. I have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me. At the same time\u2014not to deceive you\u2014I believe I am worthy of her. So, I thank you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present company, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have found. And I hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found.\u2019 Shortly after which oration, as they were going on a nuptial trip to Lyons, in order that Mr. Bounderby might take the opportunity of seeing how the Hands got on in those parts, and whether they, too, required to be fed with gold spoons; the happy pair departed for the railroad. The bride, in passing down-stairs, dressed for her journey, found Tom waiting for her\u2014flushed, either with his feelings, or the vinous part of the breakfast. \u2018What a game girl you are, to be such a first-rate sister, Loo!\u2019 whispered Tom. She clung to him as she should have clung to some far better nature that day, and was a little shaken in her reserved composure for the first time. \u2018Old Bounderby\u2019s quite ready,\u2019 said Tom.", " \u2018Now, you\u2019ll think this pretty well, Harthouse,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018You\u2019ll think this tolerably strong. You\u2019ll say, upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with; but this is nothing, sir! You shall hear me ask this man a question. Pray, Mr. Blackpool\u2019\u2014wind springing up very fast\u2014\u2018may I take the liberty of asking you how it happens that you refused to be in this Combination?\u2019 \u2018How \u2019t happens?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, with his thumbs in the arms of his coat, and jerking his head and shutting his eyes in confidence with the opposite wall: \u2018how it happens.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d leefer not coom to \u2019t, sir; but sin you put th\u2019 question\u2014an\u2019 not want\u2019n t\u2019 be ill-manner\u2019n\u2014I\u2019ll answer. I ha passed a promess.\u2019 \u2018Not to me, you know,\u2019 said Bounderby. (Gusty weather with deceitful calms. One now prevailing.) \u2018O no, sir. Not to yo.\u2019 \u2018As for me, any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do with it,\u2019 said Bounderby, still in confidence with the wall. \u2018If only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown had been in question, you would have joined and made no bones about it?\u2019 \u2018Why yes, sir. \u2019Tis true.\u2019 \u2018Though he knows,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, now blowing a gale, \u2018that there are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for! Now, Mr. Harthouse, you have been knocking about in the world some time. Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country?\u2019 And Mr. Bounderby pointed him out for inspection, with an angry finger.", " He soon returned alone. \u2018Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Gradgrind, that you wanted to speak to me,\u2019 he resumed, \u2018here I am. But, I am not in a very agreeable state, I tell you plainly: not relishing this business, even as it is, and not considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter, as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be treated by his wife. You have your opinion, I dare say; and I have mine, I know. If you mean to say anything to me to-night, that goes against this candid remark, you had better let it alone.\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, Mr. Bounderby took particular pains to harden himself at all points. It was his amiable nature. \u2018My dear Bounderby,\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind began in reply. \u2018Now, you\u2019ll excuse me,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018but I don\u2019t want to be too dear. That, to start with. When I begin to be dear to a man, I generally find that his intention is to come over me. I am not speaking to you politely; but, as you are aware, I am _not_ polite. If you like politeness, you know where to get it. You have your gentleman-friends, you know, and they\u2019ll serve you with as much of the article as you want. I don\u2019t keep it myself.\u2019 \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 urged Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018we are all liable to mistakes\u2014\u2019 \u2018I thought you couldn\u2019t make \u2019em,\u2019 interrupted Bounderby. \u2018Perhaps I thought so. But, I say we are all liable to mistakes and I should feel sensible of your delicacy, and grateful for it, if you would spare me these references to Harthouse.", " \u2018Come!\u2019 said he, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be told about that. I know what I took her for, as well as you do. Never you mind what I took her for; that\u2019s my look out.\u2019 \u2018I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa.\u2019 \u2018I think differently,\u2019 blustered Bounderby. \u2018I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions. Now, I don\u2019t want to make a quarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind. To tell you the truth, I don\u2019t think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject. As to your gentleman-friend, he may take himself off, wherever he likes best. If he falls in my way, I shall tell him my mind; if he don\u2019t fall in my way, I shan\u2019t, for it won\u2019t be worth my while to do it. As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she don\u2019t come home to-morrow, by twelve o\u2019clock at noon, I shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you\u2019ll take charge of her for the future. What I shall say to people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this. I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing-up; she\u2019s the daughter of Tom Gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldn\u2019t pull together."], "Who are Mrs. Sparsit and Bitzer discussing when Harthouse comes to call?": [" \u2018No, Bitzer,\u2019 continued Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018say an individual, and I will hear you; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.\u2019 \u2018With the usual exception, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, trying back, \u2018of an individual.\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head over her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been interrupted. \u2018An individual, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, \u2018has never been what he ought to have been, since he first came into the place. He is a dissipated, extravagant idler. He is not worth his salt, ma\u2019am. He wouldn\u2019t get it either, if he hadn\u2019t a friend and relation at court, ma\u2019am!\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her head. \u2018I only hope, ma\u2019am,\u2019 pursued Bitzer, \u2018that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on. Otherwise, ma\u2019am, we know out of whose pocket _that_ money comes.\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her head. \u2018He is to be pitied, ma\u2019am. The last party I have alluded to, is to be pitied, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Yes, Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018I have always pitied the delusion, always.\u2019 \u2018As to an individual, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, dropping his voice and drawing nearer, \u2018he is as improvident as any of the people in this town. And you know what _their_ improvidence is, ma\u2019am. No one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does.\u2019 \u2018They would do well,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018to take example by you, Bitzer.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am.", " \u2018Merely going on in the old way, ma\u2019am. Uniting, and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one another.\u2019 \u2018It is much to be regretted,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity, \u2018that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018They have done that, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer; \u2018but it rather fell through, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018I do not pretend to understand these things,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with dignity, \u2018my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere; and Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions. I only know that these people must be conquered, and that it\u2019s high time it was done, once for all.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s oracular authority. \u2018You couldn\u2019t put it clearer, I am sure, ma\u2019am.\u2019 As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street. \u2018Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit.", " Why should they?\u2019 \u2018Because they are improvident,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018that\u2019s where it is. If they were more provident and less perverse, ma\u2019am, what would they do? They would say, \u201cWhile my hat covers my family,\u201d or \u201cwhile my bonnet covers my family,\u201d\u2014as the case might be, ma\u2019am\u2014\u201cI have only one to feed, and that\u2019s the person I most like to feed.\u201d\u2019 \u2018To be sure,\u2019 assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin. \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s improving conversation. \u2018Would you wish a little more hot water, ma\u2019am, or is there anything else that I could fetch you?\u2019 \u2018Nothing just now, Bitzer.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am. I shouldn\u2019t wish to disturb you at your meals, ma\u2019am, particularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,\u2019 said Bitzer, craning a little to look over into the street from where he stood; \u2018but there\u2019s a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, ma\u2019am, and he has come across as if he was going to knock. That _is_ his knock, ma\u2019am, no doubt.\u2019 He stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his head again, confirmed himself with, \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am. Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in, ma\u2019am?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know who it can be,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping her mouth and arranging her mittens. \u2018A stranger, ma\u2019am, evidently.\u2019 \u2018What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless he comes upon some business for which he is too late, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr. Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it.", " \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward. So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table."], "Why has Harthouse decided to begin a political career in Coketown?": [" Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand; superscribed, \u2018Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown. Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire. Thomas Gradgrind.\u2019 Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse\u2019s card, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel. There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to \u2018go in\u2019 for something else. \u2018My name, sir,\u2019 said his visitor, \u2018is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure he had long expected. \u2018Coketown, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, \u2018is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to. Therefore, if you will allow me\u2014or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man\u2014I\u2019ll tell you something about it before we go any further.\u2019 Mr. Harthouse would be charmed. \u2018Don\u2019t be too sure of that,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I don\u2019t promise it. First of all, you see our smoke. That\u2019s meat and drink to us. It\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the lungs. If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from you. We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear \u2019em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland.\u2019 By way of \u2018going in\u2019 to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, \u2018Mr.", " * * * * * Into how much of futurity? He saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily fight at the points of all the weapons in the female armoury, with the grudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting Lady Scadgers, still laid up in bed with her mysterious leg, and gobbling her insufficient income down by about the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a mere closet for one, a mere crib for two; but did he see more? Did he catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers, as the rising young man, so devoted to his master\u2019s great merits, who had won young Tom\u2019s place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when by various rascals he was spirited away? Did he see any faint reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking upon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend a Bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster? Had he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street, and this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile example, little service and much law?", " \u2018This, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind\u2019s eldest daughter. Loo, Mr. James Harthouse. Mr. Harthouse has joined your father\u2019s muster-roll. If he is not Tom Gradgrind\u2019s colleague before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns. You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior. I don\u2019t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw something in me, I suppose, or she wouldn\u2019t have married me. She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise. If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby.\u2019 To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to learn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended. \u2018Come!\u2019 said his host. \u2018If you\u2019re in the complimentary line, you\u2019ll get on here, for you\u2019ll meet with no competition. I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I don\u2019t profess to understand the art of paying \u2019em. In fact, despise \u2019em. But, your bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real thing, by George! You\u2019re a gentleman, and I don\u2019t pretend to be one. I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, and that\u2019s enough for me. However, though I am not influenced by manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be. She hadn\u2019t my advantages\u2014disadvantages you would call \u2019em, but I call \u2019em advantages\u2014so you\u2019ll not waste your power, I dare say.\u2019 \u2018Mr.", " She stood looking intently at him, and Louisa stood coldly by, with her eyes upon the ground, while he proceeded thus: \u2018Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you are not in attendance at the school, to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind, who is rather an invalid. I have explained to Miss Louisa\u2014this is Miss Louisa\u2014the miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not to be referred to any more. From this time you begin your history. You are, at present, ignorant, I know.\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir, very,\u2019 she answered, curtseying. \u2018I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated; and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you, of the advantages of the training you will receive. You will be reclaimed and formed. You have been in the habit now of reading to your father, and those people I found you among, I dare say?\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, beckoning her nearer to him before he said so, and dropping his voice. \u2018Only to father and Merrylegs, sir. At least I mean to father, when Merrylegs was always there.\u2019 \u2018Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, with a passing frown. \u2018I don\u2019t ask about him. I understand you to have been in the habit of reading to your father?\u2019 \u2018O, yes, sir, thousands of times. They were the happiest\u2014O, of all the happy times we had together, sir!\u2019 It was only now when her sorrow broke out, that Louisa looked at her."], "Harthouse uses wine and tobacco to try to coax Tom to talk about___.": [" Then why doesn\u2019t she get what I want, out of him, for my sake? She is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough; she could manage to coax it out of him, if she chose. Then why doesn\u2019t she choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is? But no. There she sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily. I don\u2019t know what you may call this, but I call it unnatural conduct.\u2019 There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on the other side, into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior, as the injured men of Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic. But he preserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little surface-island. \u2018My dear Tom,\u2019 said Harthouse, \u2018let me try to be your banker.\u2019 \u2018For God\u2019s sake,\u2019 replied Tom, suddenly, \u2018don\u2019t talk about bankers!\u2019 And very white he looked, in contrast with the roses. Very white. Mr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accustomed to the best society, was not to be surprised\u2014he could as soon have been affected\u2014but he raised his eyelids a little more, as if they were lifted by a feeble touch of wonder. Albeit it was as much against the precepts of his school to wonder, as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind College.", " Without responding to these telegraphic communications, Mr. Harthouse encouraged him much in the course of the evening, and showed an unusual liking for him. At last, when he rose to return to his hotel, and was a little doubtful whether he knew the way by night, the whelp immediately proffered his services as guide, and turned out with him to escort him thither. [Picture: Mr. Harthouse dines at the Bounderby\u2019s] CHAPTER III THE WHELP IT was very remarkable that a young gentleman who had been brought up under one continuous system of unnatural restraint, should be a hypocrite; but it was certainly the case with Tom. It was very strange that a young gentleman who had never been left to his own guidance for five consecutive minutes, should be incapable at last of governing himself; but so it was with Tom. It was altogether unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his cradle, should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling sensualities; but such a monster, beyond all doubt, was Tom. \u2018Do you smoke?\u2019 asked Mr. James Harthouse, when they came to the hotel. \u2018I believe you!\u2019 said Tom. He could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less than go up. What with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as cool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts; Tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and more than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end.", " Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer. \u2018A very good fellow indeed!\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018You think so, don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Tom. And shut up his eye again. Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: \u2018What a comical brother-in-law you are!\u2019 \u2018What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\u2019 retorted Mr. James Harthouse. There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. \u2018Oh! I don\u2019t care for old Bounderby,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you mean that.", " \u2018What is the present need, Tom? Three figures? Out with them. Say what they are.\u2019 \u2018Mr. Harthouse,\u2019 returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were better than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: \u2018it\u2019s too late; the money is of no use to me at present. I should have had it before to be of use to me. But I am very much obliged to you; you\u2019re a true friend.\u2019 A true friend! \u2018Whelp, whelp!\u2019 thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; \u2018what an Ass you are!\u2019 \u2018And I take your offer as a great kindness,\u2019 said Tom, grasping his hand. \u2018As a great kindness, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 returned the other, \u2018it may be of more use by and by. And, my good fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds. \u2018I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Now, you see, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing over a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland: \u2018every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the rest of my fellow-creatures. I am desperately intent;\u2019 the languor of his desperation being quite tropical; \u2018on your softening towards your sister\u2014which you ought to do; and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother\u2014which you ought to be.\u2019 \u2018I will be, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018No time like the present, Tom."], "Who attempts to unionize the factory workers?": [" The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round the placards, devouring them with eager eyes. Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read. These people, as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud\u2014there was always some such ready to help them\u2014stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil. Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling wheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets, there were still as many readers as before. Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had brought it in his pocket. Oh, my friends and fellow-countrymen, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown, oh, my fellow-brothers and fellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellow-men, what a to-do was there, when Slackbridge unfolded what he called \u2018that damning document,\u2019 and held it up to the gaze, and for the execration of the working-man community! \u2018Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what a traitor in the camp of those great spirits who are enrolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and of Union, is appropriately capable!", " \u2018A dozen year,\u2019 he told her. \u2018I must kiss the hand,\u2019 said she, \u2018that has worked in this fine factory for a dozen year!\u2019 And she lifted it, though he would have prevented her, and put it to her lips. What harmony, besides her age and her simplicity, surrounded her, he did not know, but even in this fantastic action there was a something neither out of time nor place: a something which it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious, or done with such a natural and touching air. He had been at his loom full half an hour, thinking about this old woman, when, having occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment, he glanced through a window which was in his corner, and saw her still looking up at the pile of building, lost in admiration. Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet, and of her two long journeys, she was gazing at it, as if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud music to her. She was gone by and by, and the day went after her, and the lights sprung up again, and the Express whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over the arches near: little felt amid the jarring of the machinery, and scarcely heard above its crash and rattle. Long before then his thoughts had gone back to the dreary room above the little shop, and to the shameful figure heavy on the bed, but heavier on his heart. Machinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse; stopped.", " \u2018I say, Loo! I thought I\u2019d come, and just hint to you what was going on: though I supposed you\u2019d most likely guess, even if you didn\u2019t know. I can\u2019t stay, because I\u2019m engaged to some fellows to-night. You won\u2019t forget how fond you are of me?\u2019 \u2018No, dear Tom, I won\u2019t forget.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a capital girl,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Good-bye, Loo.\u2019 She gave him an affectionate good-night, and went out with him to the door, whence the fires of Coketown could be seen, making the distance lurid. She stood there, looking steadfastly towards them, and listening to his departing steps. They retreated quickly, as glad to get away from Stone Lodge; and she stood there yet, when he was gone and all was quiet. It seemed as if, first in her own fire within the house, and then in the fiery haze without, she tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time, that greatest and longest-established Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he had already spun into a woman. But his factory is a secret place, his work is noiseless, and his Hands are mutes. CHAPTER XV FATHER AND DAUGHTER ALTHOUGH Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard, his room was quite a blue chamber in its abundance of blue books. Whatever they could prove (which is usually anything you like), they proved there, in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits. In that charmed apartment, the most complicated social questions were cast up, got into exact totals, and finally settled\u2014if those concerned could only have been brought to know it.", " \u2018It\u2019s ridiculous, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, \u2018because the chances are against the players.\u2019 Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working, or whether it was that her hand was out, she did no work that night. She sat at the window, when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she sat there, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from it, when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward, upward, up to the house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of the factory chimneys, up to the sky. Without a candle in the room, Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her, not thinking much of the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street cries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by, the shutting-up of shop-shutters. Not until the light porter announced that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself from her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrows\u2014by that time creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs. \u2018O, you Fool!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was alone at her supper. Whom she meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the sweetbread. CHAPTER II MR.

The rain falls very heavy, and the wind has risen.\u2019 The wind? True. It was blowing hard. Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise! To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was blowing! \u2018I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen. Landlady came round for me at dinner-time. There was some one here that needed looking to, she said. And \u2018deed she was right. All wandering and lost, Stephen. Wounded too, and bruised.\u2019 He slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head before her. \u2018I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for that she worked with me when we were girls both, and for that you courted her and married her when I was her friend\u2014\u2019 He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan. \u2018And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure and certain that \u2019tis far too merciful to let her die, or even so much as suffer, for want of aid. Thou knowest who said, \u201cLet him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her!\u201d There have been plenty to do that. Thou art not the man to cast the last stone, Stephen, when she is brought so low.\u2019 \u2018O Rachael, Rachael!\u2019 \u2018Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward thee!\u2019 she said, in compassionate accents. \u2018I am thy poor friend, with all my heart and mind.\u2019 [Picture: Stephen and Rachael in the sick room] The wounds of which she had spoken, seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast.", " \u2018I promised my sister I wouldn\u2019t.\u2019 Which Louisa hastily confirmed. \u2018And besides,\u2019 said the whelp bitterly, \u2018she tells her own story so precious well\u2014and so full\u2014that what business had I to take it out of her mouth!\u2019 \u2018Say, young lady, if you please,\u2019 pursued Rachael, \u2018why, in an evil hour, you ever came to Stephen\u2019s that night.\u2019 \u2018I felt compassion for him,\u2019 said Louisa, her colour deepening, \u2018and I wished to know what he was going to do, and wished to offer him assistance.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018Much flattered and obliged.\u2019 \u2018Did you offer him,\u2019 asked Rachael, \u2018a bank-note?\u2019 \u2018Yes; but he refused it, and would only take two pounds in gold.\u2019 Rachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again. \u2018Oh, certainly!\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018If you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not, I am bound to say it\u2019s confirmed.\u2019 \u2018Young lady,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018Stephen Blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town, and where else! There have been a meeting to-night where he have been spoken of in the same shameful way. Stephen! The honestest lad, the truest lad, the best!\u2019 Her indignation failed her, and she broke off sobbing. \u2018I am very, very sorry,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Oh, young lady, young lady,\u2019 returned Rachael, \u2018I hope you may be, but I don\u2019t know! I can\u2019t say what you may ha\u2019 done!

My dearest Louisa, I cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of your power.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and heard him then and there, within her (Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s) greedy hearing, tell her how he loved her, and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to play away all that he had in life. The objects he had lately pursued, turned worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he flung away from him like the dirt it was, compared with her. Its pursuit, nevertheless, if it kept him near her, or its renunciation if it took him from her, or flight if she shared it, or secrecy if she commanded it, or any fate, or every fate, all was alike to him, so that she was true to him,\u2014the man who had seen how cast away she was, whom she had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of which he had thought himself incapable, whom she had received into her confidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.", " Most o\u2019 aw, rating \u2019em as so much Power, and reg\u2019latin \u2019em as if they was figures in a soom, or machines: wi\u2019out loves and likens, wi\u2019out memories and inclinations, wi\u2019out souls to weary and souls to hope\u2014when aw goes quiet, draggin on wi\u2019 \u2019em as if they\u2019d nowt o\u2019 th\u2019 kind, and when aw goes onquiet, reproachin \u2019em for their want o\u2019 sitch humanly feelins in their dealins wi\u2019 yo\u2014this will never do \u2019t, sir, till God\u2019s work is onmade.\u2019 Stephen stood with the open door in his hand, waiting to know if anything more were expected of him. \u2018Just stop a moment,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, excessively red in the face. \u2018I told you, the last time you were here with a grievance, that you had better turn about and come out of that.

And you go about, sowing it and raising crops. That\u2019s the business of _your_ life, my friend.\u2019 Stephen shook his head, mutely protesting that indeed he had other business to do for his life. \u2018You are such a waspish, raspish, ill-conditioned chap, you see,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018that even your own Union, the men who know you best, will have nothing to do with you.

I\u2014I blame myseln.\u2019 While he excused himself, the old lady\u2019s cup rattled more and more. \u2018I had a son,\u2019 she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; \u2018and he did well, wonderfully well. But he is not to be spoken of if you please. He is\u2014\u2019 Putting down her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have added, by her action, \u2018dead!\u2019 Then she said aloud, \u2018I have lost him.\u2019 Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear. Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was uttered. \u2018Bounderby!\u2019 she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. \u2018Oh hide me!", " In another moment, he stood as he had stood all the time\u2014his usual stoop upon him; his pondering face addressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half shrewd, half perplexed, as if his mind were set upon unravelling something very difficult; his hat held tight in his left hand, which rested on his hip; his right arm, with a rugged propriety and force of action, very earnestly emphasizing what he said: not least so when it always paused, a little bent, but not withdrawn, as he paused. \u2018I was acquainted with all this, you know,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018except the last clause, long ago. It\u2019s a bad job; that\u2019s what it is. You had better have been satisfied as you were, and not have got married. However, it\u2019s too late to say that.\u2019 \u2018Was it an unequal marriage, sir, in point of years?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018You hear what this lady asks.

I were one-and-twenty myseln; she were twenty nighbut.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, sir?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief, with great placidity. \u2018I inferred, from its being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an unequal one in point of years.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that had an odd sheepishness about it. He fortified himself with a little more sherry. \u2018Well? Why don\u2019t you go on?\u2019 he then asked, turning rather irritably on Stephen Blackpool.", " \u2018I am glad you have come at last, Stephen.

The rain falls very heavy, and the wind has risen.\u2019 The wind? True. It was blowing hard. Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise! To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was blowing! \u2018I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen. Landlady came round for me at dinner-time. There was some one here that needed looking to, she said. And \u2018deed she was right. All wandering and lost, Stephen.

Come in, and speak up.\u2019 It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden. A tea-table was set out; and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s young wife, and her brother, and a great gentleman from London, were present. To whom Stephen made his obeisance, closing the door and standing near it, with his hat in his hand. \u2018This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. The gentleman he addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa, got up, saying in an indolent way, \u2018Oh really?\u2019 and dawdled to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood. \u2018Now,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018speak up!\u2019 After the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and discordantly on Stephen\u2019s ear. Besides being a rough handling of his wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested deserter he had been called. \u2018What were it, sir,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018as yo were pleased to want wi\u2019 me?\u2019 \u2018Why, I have told you,\u2019 returned Bounderby."], "While making preparations to look for new work, Stephen has Rachel and ___ in for tea.": [" \u2018Come to my poor place, missus,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018and tak a coop o\u2019 tea.

When they turned into a narrow street, Stephen glanced at his window with a dread that always haunted his desolate home; but it was open, as he had left it, and no one was there. The evil spirit of his life had flitted away again, months ago, and he had heard no more of her since. The only evidence of her last return now, were the scantier moveables in his room, and the grayer hair upon his head. He lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got hot water from below, and brought in small portions of tea and sugar, a loaf, and some butter from the nearest shop. The bread was new and crusty, the butter fresh, and the sugar lump, of course\u2014in fulfilment of the standard testimony of the Coketown magnates, that these people lived like princes, sir. Rachael made the tea (so large a party necessitated the borrowing of a cup), and the visitor enjoyed it mightily. It was the first glimpse of sociality the host had had for many days. He too, with the world a wide heath before him, enjoyed the meal\u2014again in corroboration of the magnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of these people, sir.", " \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you\u2019ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I\u2019ll mention it. Never mind a light, man!\u2019 Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. \u2018It don\u2019t want a light.\u2019 Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand. \u2018I say!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I think I can do you a good turn. Don\u2019t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there\u2019s no harm in my trying.\u2019 His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\u2019s ear, it was so hot. \u2018That was our light porter at the Bank,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018who brought you the message to-night. I call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.\u2019 Stephen thought, \u2018What a hurry he is in!\u2019 He spoke so confusedly. \u2018Well!\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! When are you off?\u2019 \u2018T\u2019 day\u2019s Monday,\u2019 replied Stephen, considering. \u2018Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh \u2019bout.\u2019 \u2018Friday or Saturday,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here!

So I tell you what. You\u2019ll know our light porter again?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sure,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Very well,\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018When you leave work of a night, between this and your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?", " \u2018I misdoubt,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018if there is as many as twenty left in all this place, who have any trust in the poor dear lad now.\u2019 She said it to Sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted only by the lamp at the street corner. Sissy had come there when it was already dark, to await her return from work; and they had since sat at the window where Rachael had found her, wanting no brighter light to shine on their sorrowful talk. \u2018If it hadn\u2019t been mercifully brought about, that I was to have you to speak to,\u2019 pursued Rachael, \u2018times are, when I think my mind would not have kept right. But I get hope and strength through you; and you believe that though appearances may rise against him, he will be proved clear?\u2019 \u2018I do believe so,\u2019 returned Sissy, \u2018with my whole heart. I feel so certain, Rachael, that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him than if I had known him through as many years of trial as you have.\u2019 \u2018And I, my dear,\u2019 said Rachel, with a tremble in her voice, \u2018have known him through them all, to be, according to his quiet ways, so faithful to everything honest and good, that if he was never to be heard of more, and I was to live to be a hundred years old, I could say with my last breath, God knows my heart. I have never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool!\u2019 \u2018We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he will be freed from suspicion, sooner or later.\u2019 \u2018The better I know it to be so believed there, my dear,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018and the kinder I feel it that you come away from there, purposely to comfort me, and keep me company, and be seen wi\u2019 me when I am not yet free from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.", " \u2018Then go straight up there, will you?\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018You\u2019re expected, and have only to tell the servant it\u2019s you.

You have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other\u2014they\u2019re always about\u2014and the best thing you can do is, to come out of that. Now you know;\u2019 here his countenance expressed marvellous acuteness; \u2018I can see as far into a grindstone as another man; farther than a good many, perhaps, because I had my nose well kept to it when I was young. I see traces of the turtle soup, and venison, and gold spoon in this. Yes, I do!\u2019 cried Mr. Bounderby, shaking his head with obstinate cunning. \u2018By the Lord Harry, I do!\u2019 With a very different shake of the head and deep sigh, Stephen said, \u2018Thank you, sir, I wish you good day.\u2019 So he left Mr. Bounderby swelling at his own portrait on the wall, as if he were going to explode himself into it; and Mrs. Sparsit still ambling on with her foot in her stirrup, looking quite cast down by the popular vices.", " The two travelled all night, except when they were left, for odd numbers of minutes, at branch-places, up illimitable flights of steps, or down wells\u2014which was the only variety of those branches\u2014and, early in the morning, were turned out on a swamp, a mile or two from the town they sought. From this dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old postilion, who happened to be up early, kicking a horse in a fly: and so were smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the pigs lived: which, although not a magnificent or even savoury approach, was, as is usual in such cases, the legitimate highway. The first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton of Sleary\u2019s Circus. The company had departed for another town more than twenty miles off, and had opened there last night. The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road, and the travelling on that road was very slow. Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and no rest (which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious circumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills of Sleary\u2019s Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o\u2019clock when they stopped in the market-place. A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, commencing at that very hour, was in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon the stones of the street. Sissy recommended that, to avoid making inquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should present themselves to pay at the door.", " \u2018Bless you for thinking o\u2019 the poor lad wi\u2019 such tenderness. But \u2019tis for him to know his heart, and what is right according to it.\u2019 Louisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome with quick sympathy, when this man of so much self-command, who had been so plain and steady through the late interview, lost his composure in a moment, and now stood with his hand before his face. She stretched out hers, as if she would have touched him; then checked herself, and remained still. \u2018Not e\u2019en Rachael,\u2019 said Stephen, when he stood again with his face uncovered, \u2018could mak sitch a kind offerin, by onny words, kinder. T\u2019 show that I\u2019m not a man wi\u2019out reason and gratitude, I\u2019ll tak two pound. I\u2019ll borrow \u2019t for t\u2019 pay \u2019t back. \u2019Twill be the sweetest work as ever I ha done, that puts it in my power t\u2019 acknowledge once more my lastin thankfulness for this present action.\u2019 She was fain to take up the note again, and to substitute the much smaller sum he had named. He was neither courtly, nor handsome, nor picturesque, in any respect; and yet his manner of accepting it, and of expressing his thanks without more words, had a grace in it that Lord Chesterfield could not have taught his son in a century. Tom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his walking-stick with sufficient unconcern, until the visit had attained this stage. Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word.", " When he first came out, Stephen thought he might be looking for him, and passed near; but the light porter only cast his winking eyes upon him slightly, and said nothing. Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day\u2019s labour. Stephen sat upon the step of a door, leaned against a wall under an archway, strolled up and down, listened for the church clock, stopped and watched children playing in the street. Some purpose or other is so natural to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels remarkable. When the first hour was out, Stephen even began to have an uncomfortable sensation upon him of being for the time a disreputable character. Then came the lamplighter, and two lengthening lines of light all down the long perspective of the street, until they were blended and lost in the distance. Mrs. Sparsit closed the first-floor window, drew down the blind, and went up-stairs. Presently, a light went up-stairs after her, passing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two staircase windows, on its way up. By and by, one corner of the second-floor blind was disturbed, as if Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s eye were there; also the other corner, as if the light porter\u2019s eye were on that side. Still, no communication was made to Stephen. Much relieved when the two hours were at last accomplished, he went away at a quick pace, as a recompense for so much loitering."], "Louisa realizes that the only person she truly cares for is ___.": [" Accordingly, the chance witnesses on the ground, consisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some five-and-twenty, closed in after Sissy and Rachael, as they closed in after Mrs. Sparsit and her prize; and the whole body made a disorderly irruption into Mr. Bounderby\u2019s dining-room, where the people behind lost not a moment\u2019s time in mounting on the chairs, to get the better of the people in front. \u2018Fetch Mr. Bounderby down!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Rachael, young woman; you know who this is?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s Mrs. Pegler,\u2019 said Rachael. \u2018I should think it is!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, exulting. \u2018Fetch Mr. Bounderby. Stand away, everybody!\u2019 Here old Mrs. Pegler, muffling herself up, and shrinking from observation, whispered a word of entreaty. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, aloud. \u2018I have told you twenty times, coming along, that I will _not_ leave you till I have handed you over to him myself.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby now appeared, accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and the whelp, with whom he had been holding conference up-stairs. Mr. Bounderby looked more astonished than hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room. \u2018Why, what\u2019s the matter now!\u2019 said he. \u2018Mrs. Sparsit, ma\u2019am?\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 explained that worthy woman, \u2018I trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find. Stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind, sir, and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside, as have been afforded by the young woman, Rachael, fortunately now present to identify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring that person with me\u2014I need not say most unwillingly on her part.", " I have always called old Bounderby by the same name when I have talked about him, and I have always thought of him in the same way. I am not going to begin to be polite now, about old Bounderby. It would be rather late in the day.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t mind me,\u2019 returned James; \u2018but take care when his wife is by, you know.\u2019 \u2018His wife?\u2019 said Tom. \u2018My sister Loo? O yes!\u2019 And he laughed, and took a little more of the cooling drink. James Harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and attitude, smoking his cigar in his own easy way, and looking pleasantly at the whelp, as if he knew himself to be a kind of agreeable demon who had only to hover over him, and he must give up his whole soul if required. It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence. He looked at his companion sneakingly, he looked at him admiringly, he looked at him boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa. \u2018My sister Loo?\u2019 said Tom. \u2018_She_ never cared for old Bounderby.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the past tense, Tom,\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse, striking the ash from his cigar with his little finger. \u2018We are in the present tense, now.\u2019 \u2018Verb neuter, not to care. Indicative mood, present tense. First person singular, I do not care; second person singular, thou dost not care; third person singular, she does not care,\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018Good! Very quaint!\u2019 said his friend. \u2018Though you don\u2019t mean it.\u2019 \u2018But I _do_ mean it,\u2019 cried Tom.", " And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be. Lengthy and prosy in the extreme. It was knowing to hold forth, in the humble-virtue school of eloquence; but, I assure you I thought at the time, \u201cMy good fellow, you are over-doing this!\u201d\u2019 \u2018It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man.\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa\u2014as Tom says.\u2019 Which he never did say. \u2018You know no good of the fellow?\u2019 \u2018No, certainly.\u2019 \u2018Nor of any other such person?\u2019 \u2018How can I,\u2019 she returned, with more of her first manner on her than he had lately seen, \u2018when I know nothing of them, men or women?\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend, who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow-creatures\u2014for excellent they are, I am quite ready to believe, in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of. This fellow talks. Well; every fellow talks. He professes morality. Well; all sorts of humbugs profess morality. From the House of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general profession of morality, except among our people; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving. You saw and heard the case. Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby\u2014who, as we know, is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand.", " With my head in its present state, I couldn\u2019t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the reason!\u2019 pouted Louisa. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s the reason, because it can\u2019t be nothing of the sort,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018Go and be somethingological directly.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit. In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s stock of facts in general was woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position, had been influenced by two reasons. Firstly, she was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she had \u2018no nonsense\u2019 about her. By nonsense he meant fancy; and truly it is probable she was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was. The simple circumstance of being left alone with her husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact. So, she once more died away, and nobody minded her. \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, \u2018you are always so interested in my young people\u2014particularly in Louisa\u2014that I make no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this discovery. I have systematically devoted myself (as you know) to the education of the reason of my family."], "How much money is stolen from the bank?": [" \u2018There _is_ such a law.\u2019 Stephen, subsiding into his quiet manner, and never wandering in his attention, gave a nod. \u2018But it\u2019s not for you at all. It costs money. It costs a mint of money.\u2019 \u2018How much might that be?\u2019 Stephen calmly asked. \u2018Why, you\u2019d have to go to Doctors\u2019 Commons with a suit, and you\u2019d have to go to a court of Common Law with a suit, and you\u2019d have to go to the House of Lords with a suit, and you\u2019d have to get an Act of Parliament to enable you to marry again, and it would cost you (if it was a case of very plain sailing), I suppose from a thousand to fifteen hundred pound,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Perhaps twice the money.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s no other law?\u2019 \u2018Certainly not.\u2019 \u2018Why then, sir,\u2019 said Stephen, turning white, and motioning with that right hand of his, as if he gave everything to the four winds, \u2018\u2019_tis_ a muddle. \u2019Tis just a muddle a\u2019toogether, an\u2019 the sooner I am dead, the better.\u2019 (Mrs. Sparsit again dejected by the impiety of the people.) \u2018Pooh, pooh! Don\u2019t you talk nonsense, my good fellow,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018about things you don\u2019t understand; and don\u2019t you call the Institutions of your country a muddle, or you\u2019ll get yourself into a real muddle one of these fine mornings. The institutions of your country are not your piece-work, and the only thing you have got to do, is, to mind your piece-work. You didn\u2019t take your wife for fast and for loose; but for better for worse.", " \u2018I think so. But there are more of \u2019em in it. There\u2019s an old woman. One never hears of these things till the mischief\u2019s done; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen; there\u2019s an old woman turns up now. An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick, every now and then. _She_ watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals away with him and holds a council with him\u2014I suppose, to make her report on going off duty, and be damned to her.\u2019 There was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from observation, thought Louisa. \u2018This is not all of \u2019em, even as we already know \u2019em,\u2019 said Bounderby, with many nods of hidden meaning. \u2018But I have said enough for the present. You\u2019ll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no one. It may take time, but we shall have \u2019em. It\u2019s policy to give \u2019em line enough, and there\u2019s no objection to that.\u2019 \u2018Of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law, as notice-boards observe,\u2019 replied James Harthouse, \u2018and serve them right. Fellows who go in for Banks must take the consequences. If there were no consequences, we should all go in for Banks.\u2019 He had gently taken Louisa\u2019s parasol from her hand, and had put it up for her; and she walked under its shade, though the sun did not shine there. \u2018For the present, Loo Bounderby,\u2019 said her husband, \u2018here\u2019s Mrs. Sparsit to look after.", " She stopped, and reddened again. If he had not known it before, he would have known it then, though he had been a much duller man than he was. \u2018Since then, I have given my brother, at various times, what money I could spare: in short, what money I have had. Confiding in you at all, on the faith of the interest you profess for him, I will not do so by halves. Since you have been in the habit of visiting here, he has wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds. I have not been able to give it to him. I have felt uneasy for the consequences of his being so involved, but I have kept these secrets until now, when I trust them to your honour. I have held no confidence with any one, because\u2014you anticipated my reason just now.\u2019 She abruptly broke off. He was a ready man, and he saw, and seized, an opportunity here of presenting her own image to her, slightly disguised as her brother. \u2018Mrs. Bounderby, though a graceless person, of the world worldly, I feel the utmost interest, I assure you, in what you tell me. I cannot possibly be hard upon your brother. I understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his errors. With all possible respect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby, I think I perceive that he has not been fortunate in his training. Bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he has his part to play, he rushes into these extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that have long been forced\u2014with the very best intentions we have no doubt\u2014upon him.", " I am about to know the family, and may have much to do with them. Is the lady so very alarming? Her father gives her such a portentously hard-headed reputation, that I have a burning desire to know. Is she absolutely unapproachable? Repellently and stunningly clever? I see, by your meaning smile, you think not. You have poured balm into my anxious soul. As to age, now. Forty? Five and thirty?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright. \u2018A chit,\u2019 said she. \u2018Not twenty when she was married.\u2019 \u2018I give you my honour, Mrs. Powler,\u2019 returned the stranger, detaching himself from the table, \u2018that I never was so astonished in my life!\u2019 It really did seem to impress him, to the utmost extent of his capacity of being impressed. He looked at his informant for full a quarter of a minute, and appeared to have the surprise in his mind all the time. \u2018I assure you, Mrs. Powler,\u2019 he then said, much exhausted, \u2018that the father\u2019s manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity. I am obliged to you, of all things, for correcting so absurd a mistake. Pray excuse my intrusion. Many thanks. Good day!\u2019 He bowed himself out; and Mrs. Sparsit, hiding in the window curtain, saw him languishing down the street on the shady side of the way, observed of all the town. \u2018What do you think of the gentleman, Bitzer?\u2019 she asked the light porter, when he came to take away. \u2018Spends a deal of money on his dress, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018It must be admitted,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that it\u2019s very tasteful.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018if that\u2019s worth the money.\u2019 \u2018Besides which, ma\u2019am,\u2019 resumed Bitzer, while he was polishing the table, \u2018he looks to me as if he gamed.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s immoral to game,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit."], "Louisa receives a letter from home, telling her that ___ is dying.": [" \u2018I have such unmanageable thoughts,\u2019 returned his sister, \u2018that they _will_ wonder.\u2019 \u2018Then I beg of you, Louisa,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind, who had opened the door without being heard, \u2018to do nothing of that description, for goodness\u2019 sake, you inconsiderate girl, or I shall never hear the last of it from your father. And, Thomas, it is really shameful, with my poor head continually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you have been, and whose education has cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his sister to wonder, when he knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it.\u2019 Louisa denied Tom\u2019s participation in the offence; but her mother stopped her with the conclusive answer, \u2018Louisa, don\u2019t tell me, in my state of health; for unless you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it.\u2019 \u2018I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire, and whitening and dying. It made me think, after all, how short my life would be, and how little I could hope to do in it.\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind, rendered almost energetic. \u2018Nonsense! Don\u2019t stand there and tell me such stuff, Louisa, to my face, when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father\u2019s ears I should never hear the last of it. After all the trouble that has been taken with you! After the lectures you have attended, and the experiments you have seen!", " \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth. And he sat rocking himself over the fire, as if he was in pain. And I said, \u201cHave you hurt yourself, father?\u201d (as he did sometimes, like they all did), and he said, \u201cA little, my darling.\u201d And when I came to stoop down and look up at his face, I saw that he was crying. The more I spoke to him, the more he hid his face; and at first he shook all over, and said nothing but \u201cMy darling;\u201d and \u201cMy love!\u201d\u2019 Here Tom came lounging in, and stared at the two with a coolness not particularly savouring of interest in anything but himself, and not much of that at present.", " Mr. Bounderby\u2019s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor. He next had recourse to the administration of potent restoratives, such as screwing the patient\u2019s thumbs, smiting her hands, abundantly watering her face, and inserting salt in her mouth. When these attentions had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled her into a fast train without offering any other refreshment, and carried her back to Coketown more dead than alive. Regarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle on her arrival at her journey\u2019s end; but considered in any other light, the amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive, and impaired her claims to admiration. Utterly heedless of the wear and tear of her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, Mr. Bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to Stone Lodge. \u2018Now, Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, bursting into his father-in-law\u2019s room late at night; \u2018here\u2019s a lady here\u2014Mrs. Sparsit\u2014you know Mrs. Sparsit\u2014who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.\u2019 \u2018You have missed my letter!\u2019 exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind, surprised by the apparition. \u2018Missed your letter, sir!\u2019 bawled Bounderby. \u2018The present time is no time for letters. No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters, with his mind in the state it\u2019s in now.\u2019 \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, \u2018I speak of a very special letter I have written to you, in reference to Louisa.\u2019 \u2018Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on the table, \u2018I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me, in reference to Louisa.", " Then the thought must have come upon him, poor, poor father! of going away to try something for my sake; for when I came back, he was gone.\u2019 \u2018I say! Look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!\u2019 Tom remonstrated. \u2018There\u2019s no more to tell, Miss Louisa. I keep the nine oils ready for him, and I know he will come back. Every letter that I see in Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes, for I think it comes from father, or from Mr. Sleary about father. Mr. Sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and I trust to him to keep his word.\u2019 \u2018Do look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!\u2019 said Tom, with an impatient whistle. \u2018He\u2019ll be off if you don\u2019t look sharp!\u2019 After this, whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind in the presence of his family, and said in a faltering way, \u2018I beg your pardon, sir, for being troublesome\u2014but\u2014have you had any letter yet about me?\u2019 Louisa would suspend the occupation of the moment, whatever it was, and look for the reply as earnestly as Sissy did. And when Mr. Gradgrind regularly answered, \u2018No, Jupe, nothing of the sort,\u2019 the trembling of Sissy\u2019s lip would be repeated in Louisa\u2019s face, and her eyes would follow Sissy with compassion to the door. Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these occasions by remarking, when she was gone, that if Jupe had been properly trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes."], "Which of the Gradgrind children was raised primarily by Sissy?": [" A thief! A plunderer! A proscribed fugitive, with a price upon his head; a fester and a wound upon the noble character of the Coketown operative! Therefore, my band of brothers in a sacred bond, to which your children and your children\u2019s children yet unborn have set their infant hands and seals, I propose to you on the part of the United Aggregate Tribunal, ever watchful for your welfare, ever zealous for your benefit, that this meeting does Resolve: That Stephen Blackpool, weaver, referred to in this placard, having been already solemnly disowned by the community of Coketown Hands, the same are free from the shame of his misdeeds, and cannot as a class be reproached with his dishonest actions!\u2019 Thus Slackbridge; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious sort. A few stern voices called out \u2018No!\u2019 and a score or two hailed, with assenting cries of \u2018Hear, hear!\u2019 the caution from one man, \u2018Slackbridge, y\u2019or over hetter in\u2019t; y\u2019or a goen too fast!\u2019 But these were pigmies against an army; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to Slackbridge, and gave three cheers for him, as he sat demonstratively panting at them. These men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their homes, when Sissy, who had been called away from Louisa some minutes before, returned. \u2018Who is it?\u2019 asked Louisa. \u2018It is Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 said Sissy, timid of the name, \u2018and your brother Mr. Tom, and a young woman who says her name is Rachael, and that you know her.\u2019 \u2018What do they want, Sissy dear?\u2019 \u2018They want to see you.", " All that is difficult to me now, would be so easy then.\u2019 \u2018You might not be the better for it, Sissy.\u2019 Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, \u2018I should not be the worse, Miss Louisa.\u2019 To which Miss Louisa answered, \u2018I don\u2019t know that.\u2019 There had been so little communication between these two\u2014both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition relative to Sissy\u2019s past career\u2014that they were still almost strangers. Sissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa\u2019s face, was uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent. \u2018You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than I can ever be,\u2019 Louisa resumed. \u2018You are pleasanter to yourself, than _I_ am to _my_self.\u2019 \u2018But, if you please, Miss Louisa,\u2019 Sissy pleaded, \u2018I am\u2014O so stupid!\u2019 Louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would be wiser by-and-by. \u2018You don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Sissy, half crying, \u2018what a stupid girl I am. All through school hours I make mistakes. Mr. and Mrs. M\u2019Choakumchild call me up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes. I can\u2019t help them. They seem to come natural to me.\u2019 \u2018Mr. and Mrs. M\u2019Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018O no!\u2019 she eagerly returned. \u2018They know everything.\u2019 \u2018Tell me some of your mistakes.\u2019 \u2018I am almost ashamed,\u2019 said Sissy, with reluctance.", " And that was wrong, too.\u2019 \u2018Of course it was.\u2019 \u2018Then Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said he would try me once more. And he said, Here are the stutterings\u2014\u2019 \u2018Statistics,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Yes, Miss Louisa\u2014they always remind me of stutterings, and that\u2019s another of my mistakes\u2014of accidents upon the sea. And I find (Mr. M\u2019Choakumchild said) that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death. What is the percentage? And I said, Miss;\u2019 here Sissy fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her greatest error; \u2018I said it was nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, Miss\u2014to the relations and friends of the people who were killed. I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed.", " In such terms, no doubt, substituting the words \u2018boys and girls,\u2019 for \u2018sir,\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers before him, who were to be filled so full of facts. Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one discharge. He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away. \u2018Girl number twenty,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his square forefinger, \u2018I don\u2019t know that girl. Who is that girl?\u2019 \u2018Sissy Jupe, sir,\u2019 explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and curtseying. \u2018Sissy is not a name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Don\u2019t call yourself Sissy. Call yourself Cecilia.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s father as calls me Sissy, sir,\u2019 returned the young girl in a trembling voice, and with another curtsey. \u2018Then he has no business to do it,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Tell him he mustn\u2019t. Cecilia Jupe. Let me see. What is your father?\u2019 \u2018He belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his hand. \u2018We don\u2019t want to know anything about that, here. You mustn\u2019t tell us about that, here. Your father breaks horses, don\u2019t he?\u2019 \u2018If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses in the ring, sir.\u2019 \u2018You mustn\u2019t tell us about the ring, here."], "What is Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s metaphor for the relationship between Louisa and Mr. Harthouse?": [" \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward. So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table.", " But you shall say no more, sir. I will go, upon your invitation.\u2019 \u2018Why, when I invite you to my house, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, opening his eyes, \u2018I should hope you want no other invitation.\u2019 \u2018No, indeed, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I should hope not. Say no more, sir. I would, sir, I could see you gay again.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean, ma\u2019am?\u2019 blustered Bounderby. \u2018Sir,\u2019 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018there was wont to be an elasticity in you which I sadly miss. Be buoyant, sir!\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning. \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on his journey, and the Bank was closing, \u2018present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?\u2019 Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and followed on its heels. \u2018Mr. Thomas,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018these plain viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\u2019 \u2018Thank\u2019ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\u2019 said the whelp. And gloomily fell to. \u2018How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Where may he be at present?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative.", " Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was), and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily. So when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day before her departure, \u2018I tell you what, ma\u2019am; you shall come down here of a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.\u2019 To which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan persuasion: \u2018To hear is to obey.\u2019 Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy, into her head. Much watching of Louisa, and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s edge, must have given her as it were a lift, in the way of inspiration. She erected in her mind a mighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa coming. It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s life, to look up at her staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.", " Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness. When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped. When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on. She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad. A train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination. In Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were necessary to change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee of the station wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on over her bonnet. So disguised she had no fear of being recognized when she followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small office. Louisa sat waiting in a corner. Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in another corner. Both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the rain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the parapets of the arches. Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw the lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron tracks. The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart, announced the train. Fire and steam, and smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; Louisa put into one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little station a desert speck in the thunderstorm."], "Where does Mrs. Sparsit observe Louisa and Mr. Harthouse in an intimate conversation?": [" Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer. \u2018A very good fellow indeed!\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018You think so, don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Tom. And shut up his eye again. Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: \u2018What a comical brother-in-law you are!\u2019 \u2018What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\u2019 retorted Mr. James Harthouse. There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. \u2018Oh! I don\u2019t care for old Bounderby,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you mean that.", " \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect.

This is not a time for a lady, however highly connected, to be totally inaudible, and seemingly swallowing marbles. Tom Gradgrind, Mrs. Sparsit latterly found herself, by accident, in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman-friend, Mr. James Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Indeed!\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Ah! Indeed!\u2019 cried Bounderby. \u2018And in that conversation\u2014\u2019 \u2018It is not necessary to repeat its tenor, Bounderby. I know what passed.\u2019 \u2018You do? Perhaps,\u2019 said Bounderby, staring with all his might at his so quiet and assuasive father-in-law, \u2018you know where your daughter is at the present time!\u2019 \u2018Undoubtedly. She is here.\u2019 \u2018Here?\u2019 \u2018My dear Bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these loud out-breaks, on all accounts. Louisa is here. The moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak, and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you, Louisa hurried here, for protection. I myself had not been at home many hours, when I received her\u2014here, in this room.", " But you shall say no more, sir. I will go, upon your invitation.\u2019 \u2018Why, when I invite you to my house, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, opening his eyes, \u2018I should hope you want no other invitation.\u2019 \u2018No, indeed, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I should hope not.

It was very game of her, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018It was charming, Tom!\u2019 \u2018Not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me,\u2019 continued Tom coolly, \u2018because my liberty and comfort, and perhaps my getting on, depended on it; and she had no other lover, and staying at home was like staying in jail\u2014especially when I was gone. It wasn\u2019t as if she gave up another lover for old Bounderby; but still it was a good thing in her.\u2019 \u2018Perfectly delightful. And she gets on so placidly.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 returned Tom, with contemptuous patronage, \u2018she\u2019s a regular girl. A girl can get on anywhere. She has settled down to the life, and _she_ don\u2019t mind. It does just as well as another. Besides, though Loo is a girl, she\u2019s not a common sort of girl. She can shut herself up within herself, and think\u2014as I have often known her sit and watch the fire\u2014for an hour at a stretch.\u2019 \u2018Ay, ay? Has resources of her own,\u2019 said Harthouse, smoking quietly. \u2018Not so much of that as you may suppose,\u2019 returned Tom; \u2018for our governor had her crammed with all sorts of dry bones and sawdust. It\u2019s his system.\u2019 \u2018Formed his daughter on his own model?\u2019 suggested Harthouse. \u2018His daughter? Ah! and everybody else. Why, he formed Me that way!\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Impossible!\u2019 \u2018He did, though,\u2019 said Tom, shaking his head. \u2018I mean to say, Mr. Harthouse, that when I first left home and went to old Bounderby\u2019s, I was as flat as a warming-pan, and knew no more about life, than any oyster does.\u2019 \u2018Come, Tom!", " \u2018What is the present need, Tom? Three figures? Out with them. Say what they are.\u2019 \u2018Mr. Harthouse,\u2019 returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were better than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: \u2018it\u2019s too late; the money is of no use to me at present. I should have had it before to be of use to me. But I am very much obliged to you; you\u2019re a true friend.\u2019 A true friend! \u2018Whelp, whelp!\u2019 thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; \u2018what an Ass you are!\u2019 \u2018And I take your offer as a great kindness,\u2019 said Tom, grasping his hand. \u2018As a great kindness, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 returned the other, \u2018it may be of more use by and by. And, my good fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds. \u2018I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Now, you see, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing over a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland: \u2018every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the rest of my fellow-creatures. I am desperately intent;\u2019 the languor of his desperation being quite tropical; \u2018on your softening towards your sister\u2014which you ought to do; and on your being a more loving and agreeable sort of brother\u2014which you ought to be.\u2019 \u2018I will be, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018No time like the present, Tom.", " Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand; superscribed, \u2018Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown. Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire. Thomas Gradgrind.\u2019 Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse\u2019s card, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel. There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to \u2018go in\u2019 for something else. \u2018My name, sir,\u2019 said his visitor, \u2018is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure he had long expected. \u2018Coketown, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, \u2018is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to. Therefore, if you will allow me\u2014or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man\u2014I\u2019ll tell you something about it before we go any further.\u2019 Mr. Harthouse would be charmed. \u2018Don\u2019t be too sure of that,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I don\u2019t promise it. First of all, you see our smoke. That\u2019s meat and drink to us. It\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the lungs. If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from you. We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear \u2019em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland.\u2019 By way of \u2018going in\u2019 to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, \u2018Mr.", " \u2018Upon my honour! Why, you won\u2019t tell me, Mr. Harthouse, that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby.\u2019 \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 returned the other, \u2018what am I bound to suppose, when I find two married people living in harmony and happiness?\u2019 Tom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa. If his second leg had not been already there when he was called a dear fellow, he would have put it up at that great stage of the conversation. Feeling it necessary to do something then, he stretched himself out at greater length, and, reclining with the back of his head on the end of the sofa, and smoking with an infinite assumption of negligence, turned his common face, and not too sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him so carelessly yet so potently. \u2018You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018and therefore, you needn\u2019t be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby. She never had a lover, and the governor proposed old Bounderby, and she took him.\u2019 \u2018Very dutiful in your interesting sister,\u2019 said Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018Yes, but she wouldn\u2019t have been as dutiful, and it would not have come off as easily,\u2019 returned the whelp, \u2018if it hadn\u2019t been for me.\u2019 The tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp was obliged to go on. \u2018_I_ persuaded her,\u2019 he said, with an edifying air of superiority. \u2018I was stuck into old Bounderby\u2019s bank (where I never wanted to be), and I knew I should get into scrapes there, if she put old Bounderby\u2019s pipe out; so I told her my wishes, and she came into them."], "Mr. Gradgrind regrets he cannot help his daughter in her crisis because he never learned, \u201cthe wisdom of ___.\u201d": [" To speak unreservedly to you, I do. I am far from feeling convinced now, however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday, that I am fit for the trust you repose in me; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me; that I have the right instinct\u2014supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature\u2014how to help you, and to set you right, my child.\u2019 She had turned upon her pillow, and lay with her face upon her arm, so that he could not see it. All her wildness and passion had subsided; but, though softened, she was not in tears. Her father was changed in nothing so much as in the respect that he would have been glad to see her in tears. \u2018Some persons hold,\u2019 he pursued, still hesitating, \u2018that there is a wisdom of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart. I have not supposed so; but, as I have said, I mistrust myself now. I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient. It may not be all-sufficient; how can I venture this morning to say it is! If that other kind of wisdom should be what I have neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted, Louisa\u2014\u2019 He suggested it very doubtfully, as if he were half unwilling to admit it even now. She made him no answer, lying before him on her bed, still half-dressed, much as he had seen her lying on the floor of his room last night. \u2018Louisa,\u2019 and his hand rested on her hair again, \u2018I have been absent from here, my dear, a good deal of late; and though your sister\u2019s training has been pursued according to\u2014the system,\u2019 he appeared to come to that word with great reluctance always, \u2018it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun, in her case, at an early age.", " What I have learned has left me doubting, misbelieving, despising, regretting, what I have not learned; and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by, and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest.\u2019 \u2018And you so young, Louisa!\u2019 he said with pity. \u2018And I so young. In this condition, father\u2014for I show you now, without fear or favour, the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it\u2014you proposed my husband to me. I took him. I never made a pretence to him or you that I loved him. I knew, and, father, you knew, and he knew, that I never did. I was not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful to Tom. I made that wild escape into something visionary, and have slowly found out how wild it was. But Tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life; perhaps he became so because I knew so well how to pity him. It matters little now, except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of his errors.\u2019 As her father held her in his arms, she put her other hand upon his other shoulder, and still looking fixedly in his face, went on. \u2018When I was irrevocably married, there rose up into rebellion against the tie, the old strife, made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures, and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me, father, until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his knife into the secrets of my soul.\u2019 \u2018Louisa!\u2019 he said, and said imploringly; for he well remembered what had passed between them in their former interview.", " \u2018And what,\u2019 asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower voice, \u2018did you read to your father, Jupe?\u2019 \u2018About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the Hunchback, and the Genies,\u2019 she sobbed out; \u2018and about\u2014\u2019 \u2018Hush!\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018that is enough. Never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more. Bounderby, this is a case for rigid training, and I shall observe it with interest.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 returned Mr. Bounderby, \u2018I have given you my opinion already, and I shouldn\u2019t do as you do. But, very well, very well. Since you are bent upon it, _very_ well!\u2019 So, Mr. Gradgrind and his daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to Stone Lodge, and on the way Louisa never spoke one word, good or bad. And Mr. Bounderby went about his daily pursuits. And Mrs. Sparsit got behind her eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat, all the evening. CHAPTER VIII NEVER WONDER LET us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the tune. When she was half a dozen years younger, Louisa had been overheard to begin a conversation with her brother one day, by saying \u2018Tom, I wonder\u2019\u2014upon which Mr. Gradgrind, who was the person overhearing, stepped forth into the light and said, \u2018Louisa, never wonder!\u2019 Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the reason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and affections. Never wonder. By means of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never wonder.", " It was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog barking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with his one practicable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions. Soon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a formidable creature) already pinning Bitzer with his eye, and sticking close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight. The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense. At eight o\u2019clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high spirits. \u2018All right, Thquire!\u2019 said Mr. Sleary, \u2018your thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time. Childerth took him off, an hour and a half after we left there latht night. The horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat (he would have walthed if he hadn\u2019t been in harneth), and then I gave him the word and he went to thleep comfortable.

Tho he come back into the drag, and there he that, \u2019till I turned the horthe\u2019th head, at half-patht thixth thith morning.\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks, of course; and hinted as delicately as he could, at a handsome remuneration in money. \u2018I don\u2019t want money mythelf, Thquire; but Childerth ith a family man, and if you wath to like to offer him a five-pound note, it mightn\u2019t be unactheptable."], "What does Sissy tell Mr. Harthouse he must do with regards to Louisa?": [" All that is difficult to me now, would be so easy then.\u2019 \u2018You might not be the better for it, Sissy.\u2019 Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, \u2018I should not be the worse, Miss Louisa.\u2019 To which Miss Louisa answered, \u2018I don\u2019t know that.\u2019 There had been so little communication between these two\u2014both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition relative to Sissy\u2019s past career\u2014that they were still almost strangers. Sissy, with her dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa\u2019s face, was uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent. \u2018You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her than I can ever be,\u2019 Louisa resumed. \u2018You are pleasanter to yourself, than _I_ am to _my_self.\u2019 \u2018But, if you please, Miss Louisa,\u2019 Sissy pleaded, \u2018I am\u2014O so stupid!\u2019 Louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her she would be wiser by-and-by. \u2018You don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Sissy, half crying, \u2018what a stupid girl I am. All through school hours I make mistakes. Mr. and Mrs. M\u2019Choakumchild call me up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes. I can\u2019t help them. They seem to come natural to me.\u2019 \u2018Mr. and Mrs. M\u2019Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018O no!\u2019 she eagerly returned. \u2018They know everything.\u2019 \u2018Tell me some of your mistakes.\u2019 \u2018I am almost ashamed,\u2019 said Sissy, with reluctance.", " Even when their eyes had met, and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes looking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive hand, before she asked: \u2018When was I brought to this room?\u2019 \u2018Last night, Louisa.\u2019 \u2018Who brought me here?\u2019 \u2018Sissy, I believe.\u2019 \u2018Why do you believe so?\u2019 \u2018Because I found her here this morning. She didn\u2019t come to my bedside to wake me, as she always does; and I went to look for her. She was not in her own room either; and I went looking for her all over the house, until I found her here taking care of you and cooling your head. Will you see father? Sissy said I was to tell him when you woke.\u2019 \u2018What a beaming face you have, Jane!\u2019 said Louisa, as her young sister\u2014timidly still\u2014bent down to kiss her. \u2018Have I? I am very glad you think so. I am sure it must be Sissy\u2019s doing.\u2019 The arm Louisa had begun to twine around her neck, unbent itself. \u2018You can tell father if you will.\u2019 Then, staying her for a moment, she said, \u2018It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of welcome?\u2019 \u2018Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came. It was\u2014\u2019 Louisa turned upon her pillow, and heard no more. When her sister had withdrawn, she turned her head back again, and lay with her face towards the door, until it opened and her father entered. He had a jaded anxious look upon him, and his hand, usually steady, trembled in hers. He sat down at the side of the bed, tenderly asking how she was, and dwelling on the necessity of her keeping very quiet after her agitation and exposure to the weather last night.", " Then the thought must have come upon him, poor, poor father! of going away to try something for my sake; for when I came back, he was gone.\u2019 \u2018I say! Look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!\u2019 Tom remonstrated. \u2018There\u2019s no more to tell, Miss Louisa. I keep the nine oils ready for him, and I know he will come back. Every letter that I see in Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes, for I think it comes from father, or from Mr. Sleary about father. Mr. Sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and I trust to him to keep his word.\u2019 \u2018Do look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!\u2019 said Tom, with an impatient whistle. \u2018He\u2019ll be off if you don\u2019t look sharp!\u2019 After this, whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind in the presence of his family, and said in a faltering way, \u2018I beg your pardon, sir, for being troublesome\u2014but\u2014have you had any letter yet about me?\u2019 Louisa would suspend the occupation of the moment, whatever it was, and look for the reply as earnestly as Sissy did. And when Mr. Gradgrind regularly answered, \u2018No, Jupe, nothing of the sort,\u2019 the trembling of Sissy\u2019s lip would be repeated in Louisa\u2019s face, and her eyes would follow Sissy with compassion to the door. Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these occasions by remarking, when she was gone, that if Jupe had been properly trained from an early age she would have remonstrated to herself on sound principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes.", " Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand; superscribed, \u2018Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown. Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire. Thomas Gradgrind.\u2019 Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse\u2019s card, Mr. Bounderby put on his hat and went down to the Hotel. There he found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to \u2018go in\u2019 for something else. \u2018My name, sir,\u2019 said his visitor, \u2018is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed (though he scarcely looked so) to have a pleasure he had long expected. \u2018Coketown, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, \u2018is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to. Therefore, if you will allow me\u2014or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man\u2014I\u2019ll tell you something about it before we go any further.\u2019 Mr. Harthouse would be charmed. \u2018Don\u2019t be too sure of that,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I don\u2019t promise it. First of all, you see our smoke. That\u2019s meat and drink to us. It\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the lungs. If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from you. We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear \u2019em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland.\u2019 By way of \u2018going in\u2019 to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, \u2018Mr."], "What causes Mrs. Sparsit to get sick?": [" \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward. So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table.", " Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness. When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped. When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on. She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad. A train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination. In Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were necessary to change her usual appearance; but, she stopped under the lee of the station wall, tumbled her shawl into a new shape, and put it on over her bonnet. So disguised she had no fear of being recognized when she followed up the railroad steps, and paid her money in the small office. Louisa sat waiting in a corner. Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in another corner. Both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the rain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the parapets of the arches. Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw the lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron tracks. The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart, announced the train. Fire and steam, and smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; Louisa put into one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another: the little station a desert speck in the thunderstorm.", " \u2018Merely going on in the old way, ma\u2019am. Uniting, and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one another.\u2019 \u2018It is much to be regretted,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, making her nose more Roman and her eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her severity, \u2018that the united masters allow of any such class-combinations.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018They have done that, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer; \u2018but it rather fell through, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018I do not pretend to understand these things,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with dignity, \u2018my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere; and Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions. I only know that these people must be conquered, and that it\u2019s high time it was done, once for all.\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s oracular authority. \u2018You couldn\u2019t put it clearer, I am sure, ma\u2019am.\u2019 As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street. \u2018Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit.", " But you shall say no more, sir. I will go, upon your invitation.\u2019 \u2018Why, when I invite you to my house, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, opening his eyes, \u2018I should hope you want no other invitation.\u2019 \u2018No, indeed, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I should hope not. Say no more, sir. I would, sir, I could see you gay again.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean, ma\u2019am?\u2019 blustered Bounderby. \u2018Sir,\u2019 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018there was wont to be an elasticity in you which I sadly miss. Be buoyant, sir!\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning. \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on his journey, and the Bank was closing, \u2018present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?\u2019 Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and followed on its heels. \u2018Mr. Thomas,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018these plain viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\u2019 \u2018Thank\u2019ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\u2019 said the whelp. And gloomily fell to. \u2018How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Where may he be at present?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative."], "How does Bounderby react to Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s request that Louisa be allowed to recover at Stone Lodge for a time?": [" No little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon; it was up in the moon before it could speak distinctly. No little Gradgrind had ever learnt the silly jingle, Twinkle, twinkle, little star; how I wonder what you are! No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the subject, each little Gradgrind having at five years old dissected the Great Bear like a Professor Owen, and driven Charles\u2019s Wain like a locomotive engine-driver. No little Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field with that famous cow with the crumpled horn who tossed the dog who worried the cat who killed the rat who ate the malt, or with that yet more famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb: it had never heard of those celebrities, and had only been introduced to a cow as a graminivorous ruminating quadruped with several stomachs. To his matter-of-fact home, which was called Stone Lodge, Mr. Gradgrind directed his steps. He had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware trade before he built Stone Lodge, and was now looking about for a suitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in Parliament. Stone Lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great town\u2014called Coketown in the present faithful guide-book. A very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge was. Not the least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in the landscape. A great square house, with a heavy portico darkening the principal windows, as its master\u2019s heavy brows overshadowed his eyes.", " She had that tenderness for his melancholy fate, that his great red countenance used to break out into cold perspirations when she looked at him. Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeks\u2019 time, and Mr. Bounderby went every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted wooer. Love was made on these occasions in the form of bracelets; and, on all occasions during the period of betrothal, took a manufacturing aspect. Dresses were made, jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were made, settlements were made, and an extensive assortment of Facts did appropriate honour to the contract. The business was all Fact, from first to last. The Hours did not go through any of those rosy performances, which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times; neither did the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other seasons. The deadly statistical recorder in the Gradgrind observatory knocked every second on the head as it was born, and buried it with his accustomed regularity. So the day came, as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason; and when it came, there were married in the church of the florid wooden legs\u2014that popular order of architecture\u2014Josiah Bounderby Esquire of Coketown, to Louisa eldest daughter of Thomas Gradgrind Esquire of Stone Lodge, M.P. for that borough. And when they were united in holy matrimony, they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge aforesaid.", " Mr. Bounderby\u2019s first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave her to progress as she might through various stages of suffering on the floor. He next had recourse to the administration of potent restoratives, such as screwing the patient\u2019s thumbs, smiting her hands, abundantly watering her face, and inserting salt in her mouth. When these attentions had recovered her (which they speedily did), he hustled her into a fast train without offering any other refreshment, and carried her back to Coketown more dead than alive. Regarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle on her arrival at her journey\u2019s end; but considered in any other light, the amount of damage she had by that time sustained was excessive, and impaired her claims to admiration. Utterly heedless of the wear and tear of her clothes and constitution, and adamant to her pathetic sneezes, Mr. Bounderby immediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to Stone Lodge. \u2018Now, Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, bursting into his father-in-law\u2019s room late at night; \u2018here\u2019s a lady here\u2014Mrs. Sparsit\u2014you know Mrs. Sparsit\u2014who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.\u2019 \u2018You have missed my letter!\u2019 exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind, surprised by the apparition. \u2018Missed your letter, sir!\u2019 bawled Bounderby. \u2018The present time is no time for letters. No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters, with his mind in the state it\u2019s in now.\u2019 \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, \u2018I speak of a very special letter I have written to you, in reference to Louisa.\u2019 \u2018Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on the table, \u2018I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me, in reference to Louisa.", " This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental. She was so humble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby\u2019s breakfast, before Mrs. Gradgrind\u2014she begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby\u2014she hoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though she trusted to become familiar with it by and by\u2014had assumed her present position. It was only (she observed) because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s time was so very precious, and she knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment, that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his will had been a law to her. \u2018There! Stop where you are, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018stop where you are! Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I believe.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t say that, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity, \u2018because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby. And to be unkind is not to be you, sir.\u2019 \u2018You may set your mind at rest, ma\u2019am.\u2014You can take it very quietly, can\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife. \u2018Of course. It is of no moment. Why should it be of any importance to me?\u2019 \u2018Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight."], "When Louisa leaves, what does Bounderby focus his rage on?": [" If he should wish her to remain here a day or two longer, of course she can, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018Of course she can if you wish it, Mr. Bounderby.\u2019 \u2018I told him I would give her a shake-down here, last night, in order that he might sleep on it before he decided to let her have any association with Louisa.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, Mr. Bounderby? Very thoughtful of you!\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s Coriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea. \u2018It\u2019s tolerably clear to _me_,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship.\u2019 \u2018Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, I\u2019m speaking of Louisa.\u2019 \u2018Your observation being limited to \u201clittle puss,\u201d\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018and there being two little girls in question, I did not know which might be indicated by that expression.\u2019 \u2018Louisa,\u2019 repeated Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Louisa, Louisa.\u2019 \u2018You are quite another father to Louisa, sir.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit took a little more tea; and, as she bent her again contracted eyebrows over her steaming cup, rather looked as if her classical countenance were invoking the infernal gods. \u2018If you had said I was another father to Tom\u2014young Tom, I mean, not my friend Tom Gradgrind\u2014you might have been nearer the mark. I am going to take young Tom into my office. Going to have him under my wing, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018Indeed? Rather young for that, is he not, sir?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s \u2018sir,\u2019 in addressing Mr. Bounderby, was a word of ceremony, rather exacting consideration for herself in the use, than honouring him.", " Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything? Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can have got into the house? Because, in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so incomprehensible.\u2019 \u2018Stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility. \u2018You have one of those strollers\u2019 children in the school.\u2019 \u2018Cecilia Jupe, by name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken look at his friend. \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby.", " The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and the discovery is not mine. I think there are\u2014Bounderby, you will be surprised to hear me say this\u2014I think there are qualities in Louisa, which\u2014which have been harshly neglected, and\u2014and a little perverted. And\u2014and I would suggest to you, that\u2014that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while\u2014and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration\u2014it\u2014it would be the better for the happiness of all of us. Louisa,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, shading his face with his hand, \u2018has always been my favourite child.\u2019 The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on hearing these words, that he seemed to be, and probably was, on the brink of a fit. With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent up his indignation, however, and said: \u2018You\u2019d like to keep her here for a time?\u2019 \u2018I\u2014I had intended to recommend, my dear Bounderby, that you should allow Louisa to remain here on a visit, and be attended by Sissy (I mean of course Cecilia Jupe), who understands her, and in whom she trusts.\u2019 \u2018I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, standing up with his hands in his pockets, \u2018that you are of opinion that there\u2019s what people call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself.\u2019 \u2018I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa, and\u2014and\u2014and almost all the relations in which I have placed her,\u2019 was her father\u2019s sorrowful reply.", " It\u2019s as much as he can do to write; and it\u2019s more than people in general can do to read his writing. Though it\u2019s plain to _me_.\u2019 \u2018Your mother?\u2019 \u2018Father says she was quite a scholar. She died when I was born. She was;\u2019 Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; \u2018she was a dancer.\u2019 \u2018Did your father love her?\u2019 Louisa asked these questions with a strong, wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and hiding in solitary places. \u2018O yes! As dearly as he loves me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from that time.\u2019 \u2018Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do. When he left me for my good\u2014he never would have left me for his own\u2014I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial. He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back.\u2019 \u2018Tell me more about him,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018I will never ask you again. Where did you live?\u2019 \u2018We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in. Father\u2019s a;\u2019 Sissy whispered the awful word, \u2018a clown.\u2019 \u2018To make the people laugh?\u2019 said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence. \u2018Yes. But they wouldn\u2019t laugh sometimes, and then father cried. Lately, they very often wouldn\u2019t laugh, and he used to come home despairing. Father\u2019s not like most. Those who didn\u2019t know him as well as I do, and didn\u2019t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right."], "Who visits Rachel every night, waiting for news of Stephen?": [" There\u2019s an English family with a charming Italian motto. What will be, will be. It\u2019s the only truth going!\u2019 This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty\u2014a vice so dangerous, so deadly, and so common\u2014seemed, he observed, a little to impress her in his favour. He followed up the advantage, by saying in his pleasantest manner: a manner to which she might attach as much or as little meaning as she pleased: \u2018The side that can prove anything in a line of units, tens, hundreds, and thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford the most fun, and to give a man the best chance. I am quite as much attached to it as if I believed it. I am quite ready to go in for it, to the same extent as if I believed it. And what more could I possibly do, if I did believe it!\u2019 \u2018You are a singular politician,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Pardon me; I have not even that merit. We are the largest party in the state, I assure you, Mrs. Bounderby, if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed here with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six, and taking Mr. James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to the voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity. The round of visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet use of his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a considerable accession of boredom.", " It seemed now hours and hours since she had left the lost man lying in the grave where he had been buried alive. She could not bear to remain away from it any longer\u2014it was like deserting him\u2014and she hurried swiftly back, accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers, including the drunken man whom the news had sobered, and who was the best man of all. When they came to the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as she had left it. The men called and listened as she had done, and examined the edge of the chasm, and settled how it had happened, and then sat down to wait until the implements they wanted should come up. Every sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the leaves, every whisper among these men, made Sissy tremble, for she thought it was a cry at the bottom of the pit. But the wind blew idly over it, and no sound arose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, waiting and waiting. After they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the accident began to come up; then the real help of implements began to arrive. In the midst of this, Rachael returned; and with her party there was a surgeon, who brought some wine and medicines. But, the expectation among the people that the man would be found alive was very slight indeed. There being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man put himself at the head of the rest, or was put there by the general consent, and made a large ring round the Old Hell Shaft, and appointed men to keep it.", " The messengers returned alone. Rachael\u2019s letter had gone, Rachael\u2019s letter had been delivered. Stephen Blackpool had decamped in that same hour; and no soul knew more of him. The only doubt in Coketown was, whether Rachael had written in good faith, believing that he really would come back, or warning him to fly. On this point opinion was divided. Six days, seven days, far on into another week. The wretched whelp plucked up a ghastly courage, and began to grow defiant. \u2018_Was_ the suspected fellow the thief? A pretty question! If not, where was the man, and why did he not come back?\u2019 Where was the man, and why did he not come back? In the dead of night the echoes of his own words, which had rolled Heaven knows how far away in the daytime, came back instead, and abided by him until morning. CHAPTER V FOUND DAY and night again, day and night again. No Stephen Blackpool. Where was the man, and why did he not come back? Every night, Sissy went to Rachael\u2019s lodging, and sat with her in her small neat room. All day, Rachael toiled as such people must toil, whatever their anxieties. The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was lost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants, like the Hard Fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever happened. Day and night again, day and night again. The monotony was unbroken. Even Stephen Blackpool\u2019s disappearance was falling into the general way, and becoming as monotonous a wonder as any piece of machinery in Coketown.", " A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s empire. The deaf serving-woman was rumoured to be wealthy; and a saying had for years gone about among the lower orders of Coketown, that she would be murdered some night when the Bank was shut, for the sake of her money. It was generally considered, indeed, that she had been due some time, and ought to have fallen long ago; but she had kept her life, and her situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much offence and disappointment. Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its tripod of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours, into the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that bestrode the middle of the room. The light porter placed the tea-tray on it, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage. \u2018Thank you, Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Thank _you_, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned the light porter. He was a very light porter indeed; as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a horse, for girl number twenty. \u2018All is shut up, Bitzer?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018All is shut up, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018And what,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her tea, \u2018is the news of the day? Anything?\u2019 \u2018Well, ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t say that I have heard anything particular. Our people are a bad lot, ma\u2019am; but that is no news, unfortunately.\u2019 \u2018What are the restless wretches doing now?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit."], "Who does Rachel see Mrs. Sparsit dragging into Bounderby\u2019s house?": [" Several coaches were rattling before them and behind them as they approached Mr. Bounderby\u2019s, and one of the latter drew up with such briskness as they were in the act of passing the house, that they looked round involuntarily. The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby\u2019s steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an ecstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment, called to them to stop. \u2018It\u2019s a coincidence,\u2019 exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she was released by the coachman. \u2018It\u2019s a Providence! Come out, ma\u2019am!\u2019 then said Mrs. Sparsit, to some one inside, \u2018come out, or we\u2019ll have you dragged out!\u2019 Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended. Whom Mrs. Sparsit incontinently collared. \u2018Leave her alone, everybody!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, with great energy. \u2018Let nobody touch her. She belongs to me. Come in, ma\u2019am!\u2019 then said Mrs. Sparsit, reversing her former word of command. \u2018Come in, ma\u2019am, or we\u2019ll have you dragged in!\u2019 The spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an ancient woman by the throat, and hauling her into a dwelling-house, would have been under any circumstances, sufficient temptation to all true English stragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into that dwelling-house and see the matter out. But when the phenomenon was enhanced by the notoriety and mystery by this time associated all over the town with the Bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers in, with an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been expected to fall upon their heads.", " \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward. So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table.", " But you shall say no more, sir. I will go, upon your invitation.\u2019 \u2018Why, when I invite you to my house, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, opening his eyes, \u2018I should hope you want no other invitation.\u2019 \u2018No, indeed, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I should hope not. Say no more, sir. I would, sir, I could see you gay again.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean, ma\u2019am?\u2019 blustered Bounderby. \u2018Sir,\u2019 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018there was wont to be an elasticity in you which I sadly miss. Be buoyant, sir!\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning. \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on his journey, and the Bank was closing, \u2018present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?\u2019 Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and followed on its heels. \u2018Mr. Thomas,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018these plain viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\u2019 \u2018Thank\u2019ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\u2019 said the whelp. And gloomily fell to. \u2018How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Where may he be at present?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative.", " \u2018He is shooting in Yorkshire,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church, yesterday.\u2019 \u2018The kind of gentleman, now,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, \u2018whom one might wager to be a good shot!\u2019 \u2018Crack,\u2019 said Tom. He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together. Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were so inclined. \u2018Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018as indeed he is of most people. May we expect to see him again shortly, Mr. Tom?\u2019 \u2018Why, _I_ expect to see him to-morrow,\u2019 returned the whelp. \u2018Good news!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, blandly. \u2018I have got an appointment with him to meet him in the evening at the station here,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018and I am going to dine with him afterwards, I believe. He is not coming down to the country house for a week or so, being due somewhere else. At least, he says so; but I shouldn\u2019t wonder if he was to stop here over Sunday, and stray that way.\u2019 \u2018Which reminds me!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Would you remember a message to your sister, Mr. Tom, if I was to charge you with one?\u2019 \u2018Well? I\u2019ll try,\u2019 returned the reluctant whelp, \u2018if it isn\u2019t a long un.\u2019 \u2018It is merely my respectful compliments,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018and I fear I may not trouble her with my society this week; being still a little nervous, and better perhaps by my poor self.\u2019 \u2018Oh!"], "What is the name of the mining pit that Stephen falls into?": [" \u2018I am glad you have come at last, Stephen. You are very late.\u2019 \u2018I ha\u2019 been walking up an\u2019 down.\u2019 \u2018I thought so. But \u2019tis too bad a night for that. The rain falls very heavy, and the wind has risen.\u2019 The wind? True. It was blowing hard. Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise! To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was blowing! \u2018I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen. Landlady came round for me at dinner-time. There was some one here that needed looking to, she said. And \u2018deed she was right. All wandering and lost, Stephen. Wounded too, and bruised.\u2019 He slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head before her. \u2018I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for that she worked with me when we were girls both, and for that you courted her and married her when I was her friend\u2014\u2019 He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan. \u2018And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure and certain that \u2019tis far too merciful to let her die, or even so much as suffer, for want of aid. Thou knowest who said, \u201cLet him who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her!\u201d There have been plenty to do that. Thou art not the man to cast the last stone, Stephen, when she is brought so low.\u2019 \u2018O Rachael, Rachael!\u2019 \u2018Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward thee!\u2019 she said, in compassionate accents. \u2018I am thy poor friend, with all my heart and mind.\u2019 [Picture: Stephen and Rachael in the sick room] The wounds of which she had spoken, seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast.", " As these were made, they were hung upon an arm of the pitman who had last come up, with instructions how to use them: and as he stood, shown by the light he carried, leaning his powerful loose hand upon one of the poles, and sometimes glancing down the pit, and sometimes glancing round upon the people, he was not the least conspicuous figure in the scene. It was dark now, and torches were kindled. It appeared from the little this man said to those about him, which was quickly repeated all over the circle, that the lost man had fallen upon a mass of crumbled rubbish with which the pit was half choked up, and that his fall had been further broken by some jagged earth at the side. He lay upon his back with one arm doubled under him, and according to his own belief had hardly stirred since he fell, except that he had moved his free hand to a side pocket, in which he remembered to have some bread and meat (of which he had swallowed crumbs), and had likewise scooped up a little water in it now and then. He had come straight away from his work, on being written to, and had walked the whole journey; and was on his way to Mr. Bounderby\u2019s country house after dark, when he fell. He was crossing that dangerous country at such a dangerous time, because he was innocent of what was laid to his charge, and couldn\u2019t rest from coming the nearest way to deliver himself up. The Old Hell Shaft, the pitman said, with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the last; for though Stephen could speak now, he believed it would soon be found to have mangled the life out of him.", " It was impossible to hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she would have flung herself down the shaft. \u2018Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these dreadful cries! Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\u2019 By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of such a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her with a tearless face of stone. \u2018Rachael, Stephen may be living. You wouldn\u2019t leave him lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him?\u2019 \u2018No, no, no!\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t stir from here, for his sake! Let me go and listen.\u2019 She shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on her hands and knees, and called to him as loud as she could call. She listened, but no sound replied. She called again and listened; still no answering sound. She did this, twenty, thirty times. She took a little clod of earth from the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in. She could not hear it fall. The wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago, almost carried despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all round her, seeing no help. \u2018Rachael, we must lose not a moment. We must go in different directions, seeking aid. You shall go by the way we have come, and I will go forward by the path. Tell any one you see, and every one what has happened.", " \u2018I ha never thowt yet, missus,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018o\u2019 askin thy name.\u2019 The old lady announced herself as \u2018Mrs. Pegler.\u2019 \u2018A widder, I think?\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Oh, many long years!\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s husband (one of the best on record) was already dead, by Mrs. Pegler\u2019s calculation, when Stephen was born. \u2018\u2019Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Onny children?\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted some nervousness on her part. \u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018Not now, not now.\u2019 \u2018Dead, Stephen,\u2019 Rachael softly hinted. \u2018I\u2019m sooary I ha spok\u2019n on \u2019t,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018I ought t\u2019 hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place. I\u2014I blame myseln.\u2019 While he excused himself, the old lady\u2019s cup rattled more and more. \u2018I had a son,\u2019 she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; \u2018and he did well, wonderfully well. But he is not to be spoken of if you please. He is\u2014\u2019 Putting down her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have added, by her action, \u2018dead!\u2019 Then she said aloud, \u2018I have lost him.\u2019 Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear. Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was uttered. \u2018Bounderby!\u2019 she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. \u2018Oh hide me!"], "Who does Tom blame for putting him in a situation that forced him to steal from the bank?": [" See his sister here. Pity us!\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer, in a very business-like and logical manner, \u2018since you ask me what motive I have in reason, for taking young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, it is only reasonable to let you know. I have suspected young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first. I had had my eye upon him before that time, for I knew his ways. I have kept my observations to myself, but I have made them; and I have got ample proofs against him now, besides his running away, and besides his own confession, which I was just in time to overhear. I had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning, and following you here. I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby. Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom\u2019s situation.

What you must always appeal to, is a person\u2019s self-interest. It\u2019s your only hold. We are so constituted. I was brought up in that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are aware.\u2019 \u2018What sum of money,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018will you set against your expected promotion?\u2019 \u2018Thank you, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018for hinting at the proposal; but I will not set any sum against it.", " \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you\u2019ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I\u2019ll mention it. Never mind a light, man!\u2019 Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. \u2018It don\u2019t want a light.\u2019 Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand. \u2018I say!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I think I can do you a good turn. Don\u2019t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there\u2019s no harm in my trying.\u2019 His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\u2019s ear, it was so hot. \u2018That was our light porter at the Bank,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018who brought you the message to-night. I call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.\u2019 Stephen thought, \u2018What a hurry he is in!\u2019 He spoke so confusedly. \u2018Well!\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here!

He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along: or he stooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick. He was startled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter pastime, and his colour changed. \u2018Halloa!\u2019 he stammered; \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u2019 \u2018Whose name, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder and turning him, so that they all three walked towards the house together, \u2018have you been carving on the trees?\u2019 \u2018Whose name?\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018Oh!

Or she might be as ugly as she was rich, without any fear of losing me. I\u2019d carve her name as often as she liked.\u2019 \u2018I am afraid you are mercenary, Tom.\u2019 \u2018Mercenary,\u2019 repeated Tom. \u2018Who is not mercenary? Ask my sister.\u2019 \u2018Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?\u2019 said Louisa, showing no other sense of his discontent and ill-nature. \u2018You know whether the cap fits you, Loo,\u2019 returned her brother sulkily. \u2018If it does, you can wear it.\u2019 \u2018Tom is misanthropical to-day, as all bored people are now and then,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse.", " Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer. \u2018A very good fellow indeed!\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018You think so, don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Tom. And shut up his eye again. Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: \u2018What a comical brother-in-law you are!\u2019 \u2018What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\u2019 retorted Mr. James Harthouse. There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. \u2018Oh! I don\u2019t care for old Bounderby,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you mean that."], "When Merrylegs the dog returns to the circus, Mr. Sleary says it\u2019s a sign that ___.": [" Perthon of the name of Thleary, in the Horthe-Riding way\u2014thtout man\u2014game eye?\u201d And whether that dog mightn\u2019t have thed, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t thay I know him mythelf, but I know a dog that I think would be likely to be acquainted with him.\u201d And whether that dog mightn\u2019t have thought it over, and thed, \u201cThleary, Thleary! O yeth, to be thure! A friend of mine menthioned him to me at one time. I can get you hith addreth directly.\u201d In conthequenth of my being afore the public, and going about tho muth, you thee, there mutht be a number of dogth acquainted with me, Thquire, that _I_ don\u2019t know!\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this speculation. \u2018Any way,\u2019 said Sleary, after putting his lips to his brandy and water, \u2018ith fourteen month ago, Thquire, thinthe we wath at Chethter. We wath getting up our Children in the Wood one morning, when there cometh into our Ring, by the thtage door, a dog. He had travelled a long way, he wath in a very bad condithon, he wath lame, and pretty well blind. He went round to our children, one after another, as if he wath a theeking for a child he know\u2019d; and then he come to me, and throwd hithelf up behind, and thtood on hith two forelegth, weak ath he wath, and then he wagged hith tail and died. Thquire, that dog wath Merrylegth.\u2019 \u2018Sissy\u2019s father\u2019s dog!\u2019 \u2018Thethilia\u2019th father\u2019th old dog. Now, Thquire, I can take my oath, from my knowledge of that dog, that that man wath dead\u2014and buried\u2014afore that dog come back to me.", " It was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog barking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with his one practicable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions. Soon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a formidable creature) already pinning Bitzer with his eye, and sticking close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight. The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense. At eight o\u2019clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high spirits. \u2018All right, Thquire!\u2019 said Mr. Sleary, \u2018your thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time. Childerth took him off, an hour and a half after we left there latht night. The horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat (he would have walthed if he hadn\u2019t been in harneth), and then I gave him the word and he went to thleep comfortable. When that prethiouth young Rathcal thed he\u2019d go for\u2019ard afoot, the dog hung on to hith neck-hankercher with all four legth in the air and pulled him down and rolled him over. Tho he come back into the drag, and there he that, \u2019till I turned the horthe\u2019th head, at half-patht thixth thith morning.\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind overwhelmed him with thanks, of course; and hinted as delicately as he could, at a handsome remuneration in money. \u2018I don\u2019t want money mythelf, Thquire; but Childerth ith a family man, and if you wath to like to offer him a five-pound note, it mightn\u2019t be unactheptable.", " Likewithe if you wath to thtand a collar for the dog, or a thet of bellth for the horthe, I thould be very glad to take \u2019em. Brandy and water I alwayth take.\u2019 He had already called for a glass, and now called for another. \u2018If you wouldn\u2019t think it going too far, Thquire, to make a little thpread for the company at about three and thixth ahead, not reckoning Luth, it would make \u2019em happy.\u2019 All these little tokens of his gratitude, Mr. Gradgrind very willingly undertook to render. Though he thought them far too slight, he said, for such a service. \u2018Very well, Thquire; then, if you\u2019ll only give a Horthe-riding, a bethpeak, whenever you can, you\u2019ll more than balanthe the account. Now, Thquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, I thould like one parting word with you.\u2019 Louisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; Mr. Sleary, stirring and drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went on: \u2018Thquire,\u2014you don\u2019t need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.\u2019 \u2018Their instinct,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018is surprising.\u2019 \u2018Whatever you call it\u2014and I\u2019m bletht if _I_ know what to call it\u2019\u2014said Sleary, \u2018it ith athtonithing. The way in whith a dog\u2019ll find you\u2014the dithtanthe he\u2019ll come!\u2019 \u2018His scent,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018being so fine.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m bletht if I know what to call it,\u2019 repeated Sleary, shaking his head, \u2018but I have had dogth find me, Thquire, in a way that made me think whether that dog hadn\u2019t gone to another dog, and thed, \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know a perthon of the name of Thleary, do you?", " \u2018Pretty well this, for a self-made man!\u2019 CHAPTER VI SLEARY\u2019S HORSEMANSHIP THE name of the public-house was the Pegasus\u2019s Arms. The Pegasus\u2019s legs might have been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse upon the sign-board, the Pegasus\u2019s Arms was inscribed in Roman letters. Beneath that inscription again, in a flowing scroll, the painter had touched off the lines: Good malt makes good beer, Walk in, and they\u2019ll draw it here; Good wine makes good brandy, Give us a call, and you\u2019ll find it handy. Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar, was another Pegasus\u2014a theatrical one\u2014with real gauze let in for his wings, golden stars stuck on all over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk. As it had grown too dusky without, to see the sign, and as it had not grown light enough within to see the picture, Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby received no offence from these idealities. They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and stopped in the dark while she went on for a candle. They expected every moment to hear Merrylegs give tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not barked when the girl and the candle appeared together. \u2018Father is not in our room, sir,\u2019 she said, with a face of great surprise. \u2018If you wouldn\u2019t mind walking in, I\u2019ll find him directly.\u2019 They walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs for them, sped away with a quick light step."]}
