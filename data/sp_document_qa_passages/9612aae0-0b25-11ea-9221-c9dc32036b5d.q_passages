He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth.", " He had travelled a long way, he wath in a very bad condithon, he wath lame, and pretty well blind.

They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm. And often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or would have her head cut off before it was finished.\u2019 \u2018And your father was always kind? To the last?\u2019 asked Louisa contravening the great principle, and wondering very much. \u2018Always, always!\u2019 returned Sissy, clasping her hands. \u2018Kinder and kinder than I can tell. He was angry only one night, and that was not to me, but Merrylegs.

CHAPTER VII MRS. SPARSIT MR. BOUNDERBY being a bachelor, an elderly lady presided over his establishment, in consideration of a certain annual stipend. Mrs. Sparsit was this lady\u2019s name; and she was a prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby\u2019s car, as it rolled along in triumph with the Bully of humility inside.", " A man of realities.

With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication table always in his pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to. It is a mere question of figures, a case of simple arithmetic. You might hope to get some other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or Augustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all supposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of Thomas Gradgrind\u2014no, sir! In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether to his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general. In such terms, no doubt, substituting the words \u2018boys and girls,\u2019 for \u2018sir,\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers before him, who were to be filled so full of facts.", " \u2018This man lives at Pod\u2019s End, and I don\u2019t quite know Pod\u2019s End,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Which is it, Bounderby?\u2019 Mr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town, but knew no more respecting it. So they stopped for a moment, looking about. Almost as they did so, there came running round the corner of the street at a quick pace and with a frightened look, a girl whom Mr. Gradgrind recognized. \u2018Halloa!\u2019 said he. \u2018Stop! Where are you going! Stop!\u2019 Girl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him a curtsey. \u2018Why are you tearing about the streets,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018in this improper manner?\u2019 \u2018I was\u2014I was run after, sir,\u2019 the girl panted, \u2018and I wanted to get away.\u2019 \u2018Run after?\u2019 repeated Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Who would run after _you_?\u2019 The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her, by the colourless boy, Bitzer, who came round the corner with such blind speed and so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement, that he brought himself up against Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s waistcoat and rebounded into the road.", " With doubts, because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her youth. With resentments, because of the wrong that had been done her, if it were indeed a whisper of the truth. Upon a nature long accustomed to self-suppression, thus torn and divided, the Harthouse philosophy came as a relief and justification. Everything being hollow and worthless, she had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing. What did it matter, she had said to her father, when he proposed her husband. What did it matter, she said still. With a scornful self-reliance, she asked herself, What did anything matter\u2014and went on. Towards what? Step by step, onward and downward, towards some end, yet so gradually, that she believed herself to remain motionless. As to Mr. Harthouse, whither _he_ tended, he neither considered nor cared. He had no particular design or plan before him: no energetic wickedness ruffled his lassitude."], "Mrs. Pegler isthe mother of which character?": [" Mr. Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr. Gradgrind addressed that maligned old lady: \u2018I am surprised, madam,\u2019 he observed with severity, \u2018that in your old age you have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son, after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him.\u2019 \u2018_Me_ unnatural!\u2019 cried poor old Mrs. Pegler. \u2018_Me_ inhuman! To my dear boy?\u2019 \u2018Dear!\u2019 repeated Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Yes; dear in his self-made prosperity, madam, I dare say. Not very dear, however, when you deserted him in his infancy, and left him to the brutality of a drunken grandmother.\u2019 \u2018_I_ deserted my Josiah!\u2019 cried Mrs. Pegler, clasping her hands. \u2018Now, Lord forgive you, sir, for your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal against the memory of my poor mother, who died in my arms before Josiah was born. May you repent of it, sir, and live to know better!\u2019 She was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind, shocked by the possibility which dawned upon him, said in a gentler tone: \u2018Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son to\u2014to be brought up in the gutter?\u2019 \u2018Josiah in the gutter!\u2019 exclaimed Mrs. Pegler.", " Rachael made the tea (so large a party necessitated the borrowing of a cup), and the visitor enjoyed it mightily. It was the first glimpse of sociality the host had had for many days. He too, with the world a wide heath before him, enjoyed the meal\u2014again in corroboration of the magnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of these people, sir. \u2018I ha never thowt yet, missus,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018o\u2019 askin thy name.\u2019 The old lady announced herself as \u2018Mrs. Pegler.\u2019 \u2018A widder, I think?\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Oh, many long years!\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s husband (one of the best on record) was already dead, by Mrs. Pegler\u2019s calculation, when Stephen was born. \u2018\u2019Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Onny children?\u2019 Mrs. Pegler\u2019s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted some nervousness on her part. \u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018Not now, not now.\u2019 \u2018Dead, Stephen,\u2019 Rachael softly hinted.", " And I never have, except with looking at him once a year, when he has never knowed it.

And I am ashamed of you, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Pegler, lastly, \u2018for your slanders and suspicions. And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no. And I shouldn\u2019t be here now, if it hadn\u2019t been for being brought here. And for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my son standing here to tell you so different!\u2019 The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had never ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and larger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short.", " \u2018My dear Josiah!\u2019 cried Mrs. Pegler, trembling. \u2018My darling boy!

Couldn\u2019t you knock her cap off, or her tooth out, or scratch her, or do something or other to her?\u2019 asked Bounderby. \u2018My own boy! She threatened me that if I resisted her, I should be brought by constables, and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in such a\u2019\u2014Mrs. Pegler glanced timidly but proudly round the walls\u2014\u2018such a fine house as this. Indeed, indeed, it is not my fault! My dear, noble, stately boy! I have always lived quiet, and secret, Josiah, my dear. I have never broken the condition once. I have never said I was your mother. I have admired you at a distance; and if I have come to town sometimes, with long times between, to take a proud peep at you, I have done it unbeknown, my love, and gone away again.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, with his hands in his pockets, walked in impatient mortification up and down at the side of the long dining-table, while the spectators greedily took in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler\u2019s appeal, and at each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed."], "Who robs the bank?": [" \u2018Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told her! Never knew her do such a thing before. Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!\u2019 She still looked faint and pale. James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed. \u2018Why, I am going to tell you,\u2019 said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you before.

To keep Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s ears as far off as possible, I expect.\u2019 With her hand upon her brother\u2019s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire.

Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read. These people, as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud\u2014there was always some such ready to help them\u2014stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil. Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling wheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets, there were still as many readers as before. Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had brought it in his pocket.", " There was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown. Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun\u2019s rays. You only knew the town was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town. A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell, or changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:\u2014Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be seen. The wonder was, it was there at all. It had been ruined so often, that it was amazing how it had borne so many shocks. Surely there never was such fragile china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were made.", " However, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that they never had pitched their property into the Atlantic yet, but, on the contrary, had been kind enough to take mighty good care of it. So there it was, in the haze yonder; and it increased and multiplied. The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun was so bright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown, and could not be looked at steadily. Stokers emerged from low underground doorways into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts, and palings, wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals. The whole town seemed to be frying in oil. There was a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere. The steam-engines shone with it, the dresses of the Hands were soiled with it, the mills throughout their many stories oozed and trickled it. The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled languidly in the desert.", " \u2018I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind.

Josiah Bounderby of Coketown learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the steeple clock of St. Giles\u2019s Church, London, under the direction of a drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant.

Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed.

Sleary himself, a stout modern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture, took the money. Miss Josephine Sleary, as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act. Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to \u2018elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing dog Merrylegs.\u2019 He was also to exhibit \u2018his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head, thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.\u2019 The same Signor Jupe was to \u2018enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.\u2019 Lastly, he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in \u2018the highly novel and laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor\u2019s Journey to Brentford.\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.", " We shall have Tom Gradgrind down here presently, I suppose.

Was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling,\u2019 Mr. Childers interpreted.", " Sissy recommended that, to avoid making inquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should present themselves to pay at the door. If Mr. Sleary were taking the money, he would be sure to know her, and would proceed with discretion. If he were not, he would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what he had done with the fugitive, would proceed with discretion still. Therefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the well-remembered booth. The flag with the inscription SLEARY\u2019S HORSE-RIDING was there; and the Gothic niche was there; but Mr. Sleary was not there. Master Kidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received by the wildest credulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to the invincible force of circumstances (and his beard), and, in the capacity of a man who made himself generally useful, presided on this occasion over the exchequer\u2014having also a drum in reserve, on which to expend his leisure moments and superfluous forces.", " Both Mr. Childers and Master Kidderminster walked in a curious manner; with their legs wider apart than the general run of men, and with a very knowing assumption of being stiff in the knees. This walk was common to all the male members of Sleary\u2019s company, and was understood to express, that they were always on horseback. \u2018Poor Sissy! He had better have apprenticed her,\u2019 said Childers, giving his hair another shake, as he looked up from the empty box. \u2018Now, he leaves her without anything to take to.\u2019 \u2018It is creditable to you, who have never been apprenticed, to express that opinion,\u2019 returned Mr. Gradgrind, approvingly. \u2018_I_ never apprenticed? I was apprenticed when I was seven year old.\u2019 \u2018Oh! Indeed?\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, rather resentfully, as having been defrauded of his good opinion. \u2018I was not aware of its being the custom to apprentice young persons to\u2014\u2019 \u2018Idleness,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby put in with a loud laugh.", " Think of it, Bounderby, in that point of view.\u2019 Meanwhile, the various members of Sleary\u2019s company gradually gathered together from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from standing about, talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers, gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room. There were two or three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands, and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children, who did the fairy business when required. The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the families on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often made a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the apex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins, ride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing."], "What does Rachaelfind that leads her to believe Stephen has been murdered?": [" He never used to go there. It was never in his way. His way was the same as mine, and not near it.\u2019 Sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of him. \u2018I doubt,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018if he can be here till next day.\u2019 \u2018Then I will come next night too,\u2019 said Sissy. When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his head, and said to his daughter: \u2018Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man. Do you believe him to be implicated?\u2019 \u2018I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty. I do not believe it now.\u2019 \u2018That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing him to be suspected. His appearance and manner; are they so honest?\u2019 \u2018Very honest.\u2019 \u2018And her confidence not to be shaken! I ask myself,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, musing, \u2018does the real culprit know of these accusations?", " If you should happen to have looked in to-night, for the purpose of telling him that you were going to do her any little service,\u2019 said Mr. Childers, stroking his face again, and repeating his look, \u2018it would be very fortunate and well-timed; very fortunate and well-timed.\u2019 \u2018On the contrary,\u2019 returned Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018I came to tell him that her connections made her not an object for the school, and that she must not attend any more. Still, if her father really has left her, without any connivance on her part\u2014Bounderby, let me have a word with you.\u2019 Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his equestrian walk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his face, and softly whistling. While thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby\u2019s voice as \u2018No. _I_ say no. I advise you not. I say by no means.\u2019 While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone the words, \u2018But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.", " She got up to look at it. \u2018And yet I don\u2019t know. This has not been broken very long. The wood is quite fresh where it gave way. Here are footsteps too.\u2014O Rachael!\u2019 She ran back, and caught her round the neck. Rachael had already started up. \u2018What is the matter?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. There is a hat lying in the grass.\u2019 They went forward together. Rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot. She broke into a passion of tears and lamentations: Stephen Blackpool was written in his own hand on the inside. \u2018O the poor lad, the poor lad! He has been made away with. He is lying murdered here!\u2019 \u2018Is there\u2014has the hat any blood upon it?\u2019 Sissy faltered. They were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of violence, inside or out. It had been lying there some days, for rain and dew had stained it, and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it had fallen. They looked fearfully about them, without moving, but could see nothing more.", " And yet I\u2014\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t mistrust her now, Rachael?\u2019 \u2018Now that you have brought us more together, no. But I can\u2019t at all times keep out of my mind\u2014\u2019 Her voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself, that Sissy, sitting by her side, was obliged to listen with attention. \u2018I can\u2019t at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one. I can\u2019t think who \u2019tis, I can\u2019t think how or why it may be done, but I mistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way. I mistrust that by his coming back of his own accord, and showing himself innocent before them all, some one would be confounded, who\u2014to prevent that\u2014has stopped him, and put him out of the way.\u2019 \u2018That is a dreadful thought,\u2019 said Sissy, turning pale. \u2018It _is_ a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered.\u2019 Sissy shuddered, and turned paler yet. \u2018When it makes its way into my mind, dear,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018and it will come sometimes, though I do all I can to keep it out, wi\u2019 counting on to high numbers as I work, and saying over and over again pieces that I knew when I were a child\u2014I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however tired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles."], "Who runs thecircus?": [" \u2018Here we go again!\u2019 \u2018A speaker, if the gentleman likes it better,\u2019 said Mr. E. W. B. Childers, superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder, and accompanying it with a shake of his long hair\u2014which all shook at once. \u2018Now, it\u2019s a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper, to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with it.\u2019 \u2018Good!\u2019 interrupted Mr. Bounderby. \u2018This is good, Gradgrind! A man so fond of his daughter, that he runs away from her! This is devilish good! Ha! ha! Now, I\u2019ll tell you what, young man. I haven\u2019t always occupied my present station of life. I know what these things are. You may be astonished to hear it, but my mother\u2014ran away from _me_.\u2019 E. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to hear it. \u2018Very well,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran away from me.

But there are more of \u2019em in it. There\u2019s an old woman. One never hears of these things till the mischief\u2019s done; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen; there\u2019s an old woman turns up now. An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick, every now and then. _She_ watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals away with him and holds a council with him\u2014I suppose, to make her report on going off duty, and be damned to her.\u2019 There was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from observation, thought Louisa. \u2018This is not all of \u2019em, even as we already know \u2019em,\u2019 said Bounderby, with many nods of hidden meaning. \u2018But I have said enough for the present.", " \u2018Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told her! Never knew her do such a thing before. Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!\u2019 She still looked faint and pale. James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed. \u2018Why, I am going to tell you,\u2019 said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you before. You know this lady (for she _is_ a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?\u2019 \u2018I have already had the honour\u2014\u2019 \u2018Very well. And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him too on the same occasion?\u2019 Mr. Harthouse inclined his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead. \u2018Very well. They live at the Bank. You know they live at the Bank, perhaps? Very well. Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything was put away as usual.", " But I touch him up with you when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an understanding. I say!

To keep Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s ears as far off as possible, I expect.\u2019 With her hand upon her brother\u2019s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire. Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him. \u2018You are very fond of me, an\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 \u2018Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me.\u2019 \u2018Well, sister of mine,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018when you say that, you are near my thoughts.", " Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word. \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo!

So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don\u2019t, I can\u2019t help it. I _do_ feel independent. Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter. I am very glad to be so. It has long been my wish to be so.

In some stages of his manufacture of the human fabric, the processes of Time are very rapid. Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage of their working up, these changes were effected in a year or two; while Mr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his course, and underwent no alteration. Except one, which was apart from his necessary progress through the mill. Time hustled him into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery, in a by-comer, and made him Member of Parliament for Coketown: one of the respected members for ounce weights and measures, one of the representatives of the multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable gentlemen, dumb honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame honourable gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to every other consideration.", " A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course got on well? Why no, not quite well. No? Dear me! No. Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in all respects like gold that had stood the fire. First, the perplexing mystery of the place was, Who belonged to the eighteen denominations? Because, whoever did, the labouring people did not. It was very strange to walk through the streets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of _them_ the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away from their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of their own streets, where they lounged listlessly, gazing at all the church and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern. Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this, because there was a native organization in Coketown itself, whose members were to be heard of in the House of Commons every session, indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main force.", " He was as much amused and interested, at present, as it became so fine a gentleman to be; perhaps even more than it would have been consistent with his reputation to confess. Soon after his arrival he languidly wrote to his brother, the honourable and jocular member, that the Bounderbys were \u2018great fun;\u2019 and further, that the female Bounderby, instead of being the Gorgon he had expected, was young, and remarkably pretty. After that, he wrote no more about them, and devoted his leisure chiefly to their house. He was very often in their house, in his flittings and visitings about the Coketown district; and was much encouraged by Mr. Bounderby. It was quite in Mr. Bounderby\u2019s gusty way to boast to all his world that _he_ didn\u2019t care about your highly connected people, but that if his wife Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter did, she was welcome to their company.

Did he see any faint reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking upon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend a Bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster? Had he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street, and this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile example, little service and much law?"], "In which citydoes most of the novel take place?": [" \u2018At last poor father said that he had given no satisfaction again, and never did give any satisfaction now, and that he was a shame and disgrace, and I should have done better without him all along. I said all the affectionate things to him that came into my heart, and presently he was quiet and I sat down by him, and told him all about the school and everything that had been said and done there. When I had no more left to tell, he put his arms round my neck, and kissed me a great many times. Then he asked me to fetch some of the stuff he used, for the little hurt he had had, and to get it at the best place, which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after kissing me again, he let me go. When I had gone down-stairs, I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him yet, and looked in at the door, and said, \u201cFather dear, shall I take Merrylegs?\u201d Father shook his head and said, \u201cNo, Sissy, no; take nothing that\u2019s known to be mine, my darling;\u201d and I left him sitting by the fire.", " A flag, floating from the summit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was \u2018Sleary\u2019s Horse-riding\u2019 which claimed their suffrages.

Miss Josephine Sleary, as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act. Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to \u2018elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing dog Merrylegs.\u2019 He was also to exhibit \u2018his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head, thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.\u2019 The same Signor Jupe was to \u2018enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.\u2019 Lastly, he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in \u2018the highly novel and laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor\u2019s Journey to Brentford.\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.", " Why, if I wanted to keep a dozen horses\u2014which I don\u2019t, for one\u2019s enough for me\u2014I couldn\u2019t bear to see \u2019em in their stalls here, and think what my own lodging used to be.

The shadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him when he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street. Nothing was further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had encountered on his previous visit to the same house, when he heard a step behind him that he knew, and turning, saw her in Rachael\u2019s company. He saw Rachael first, as he had heard her only. \u2018Ah, Rachael, my dear! Missus, thou wi\u2019 her!\u2019 \u2018Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason I must say,\u2019 the old woman returned. \u2018Here I am again, you see.\u2019 \u2018But how wi\u2019 Rachael?\u2019 said Stephen, falling into their step, walking between them, and looking from the one to the other. \u2018Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with you,\u2019 said the old woman, cheerfully, taking the reply upon herself.", " For I asked him to go there with me. The visit did not originate with him.\u2019 \u2018He had some conversation with the poor man. Did he take him aside?\u2019 \u2018He took him out of the room. I asked him afterwards, why he had done so, and he made a plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and when I remember the circumstances by its light, I am afraid I can imagine too truly what passed between them.\u2019 \u2018Let me know,\u2019 said her father, \u2018if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine.\u2019 \u2018I fear, father,\u2019 hesitated Louisa, \u2018that he must have made some representation to Stephen Blackpool\u2014perhaps in my name, perhaps in his own\u2014which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never done before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights before he left the town.\u2019 \u2018Too plain!\u2019 returned the father. \u2018Too plain!\u2019 He shaded his face, and remained silent for some moments.", " Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her work and occasionally gave a small cough, which sounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance. \u2018Well, ma\u2019am,\u2019 resumed Bounderby, \u2018under these circumstances, I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here, though you would be very welcome here.\u2019 \u2018Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit shook her head, still in her highly superior manner, and a little changed the small cough\u2014coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her, but had better be coughed down. \u2018However, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018there are apartments at the Bank, where a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a catch than otherwise; and if the same terms\u2014\u2019 \u2018I beg your pardon, sir.

And gloomily fell to. \u2018How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Where may he be at present?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative. \u2018He is shooting in Yorkshire,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church, yesterday.\u2019 \u2018The kind of gentleman, now,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, \u2018whom one might wager to be a good shot!\u2019 \u2018Crack,\u2019 said Tom. He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together. Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were so inclined. \u2018Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018as indeed he is of most people."], "Who is the firstcharacter to speak in the novel?": [" Stephen answered \u2018Yes,\u2019 again. \u2018I supposed so, from their all appearing to keep away from you.

I belong to the Bank; so, if you go straight up without me (I was sent to fetch you), you\u2019ll save me a walk.\u2019 Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby. CHAPTER V MEN AND MASTERS \u2018WELL, Stephen,\u2019 said Bounderby, in his windy manner, \u2018what\u2019s this I hear? What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_? Come in, and speak up.\u2019 It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden. A tea-table was set out; and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s young wife, and her brother, and a great gentleman from London, were present.", " Her face was innocent and youthful, and its expression remarkably pleasant. She was not afraid of him, or in any way disconcerted; she seemed to have her mind entirely preoccupied with the occasion of her visit, and to have substituted that consideration for herself. \u2018I speak to Mr. Harthouse?\u2019 she said, when they were alone. \u2018To Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 He added in his mind, \u2018And you speak to him with the most confiding eyes I ever saw, and the most earnest voice (though so quiet) I ever heard.\u2019 \u2018If I do not understand\u2014and I do not, sir\u2019\u2014said Sissy, \u2018what your honour as a gentleman binds you to, in other matters:\u2019 the blood really rose in his face as she began in these words: \u2018I am sure I may rely upon it to keep my visit secret, and to keep secret what I am going to say. I will rely upon it, if you will tell me I may so far trust\u2014\u2019 \u2018You may, I assure you.\u2019 \u2018I am young, as you see; I am alone, as you see.", " But, she had scarcely thought more of separating them into units, than of separating the sea itself into its component drops. She stood for some moments looking round the room. From the few chairs, the few books, the common prints, and the bed, she glanced to the two women, and to Stephen. \u2018I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now. I should like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me. Is this your wife?\u2019 Rachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped again. \u2018I remember,\u2019 said Louisa, reddening at her mistake; \u2018I recollect, now, to have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of, though I was not attending to the particulars at the time. It was not my meaning to ask a question that would give pain to any one here. If I should ask any other question that may happen to have that result, give me credit, if you please, for being in ignorance how to speak to you as I ought.\u2019 As Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to her, so she now instinctively addressed herself to Rachael.", " To whom Stephen made his obeisance, closing the door and standing near it, with his hat in his hand. \u2018This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. The gentleman he addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa, got up, saying in an indolent way, \u2018Oh really?\u2019 and dawdled to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood. \u2018Now,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018speak up!\u2019 After the four days he had passed, this address fell rudely and discordantly on Stephen\u2019s ear. Besides being a rough handling of his wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he really was the self-interested deserter he had been called. \u2018What were it, sir,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018as yo were pleased to want wi\u2019 me?\u2019 \u2018Why, I have told you,\u2019 returned Bounderby. \u2018Speak up like a man, since you are a man, and tell us about yourself and this Combination.\u2019 \u2018Wi\u2019 yor pardon, sir,\u2019 said Stephen Blackpool, \u2018I ha\u2019 nowt to sen about it.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, who was always more or less like a Wind, finding something in his way here, began to blow at it directly."], "Why is Stephenunable to marry Rachael?": [" The disparity I have mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all but disappears.\u2019 \u2018What do you recommend, father,\u2019 asked Louisa, her reserved composure not in the least affected by these gratifying results, \u2018that I should substitute for the term I used just now? For the misplaced expression?\u2019 \u2018Louisa,\u2019 returned her father, \u2018it appears to me that nothing can be plainer. Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him? Yes, he does. The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him? I think nothing can be plainer than that?\u2019 \u2018Shall I marry him?\u2019 repeated Louisa, with great deliberation. \u2018Precisely. And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear Louisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that belong to many young women.\u2019 \u2018No, father,\u2019 she returned, \u2018I do not.\u2019 \u2018I now leave you to judge for yourself,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind.", " Still,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018I need not point out to you, Louisa, that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate.\u2019 \u2018While it lasts, I would wish to do the little I can, and the little I am fit for. What does it matter?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words; replying, \u2018How, matter? What matter, my dear?\u2019 \u2018Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding this, \u2018asks me to marry him. The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him? That is so, father, is it not? You have told me so, father. Have you not?\u2019 \u2018Certainly, my dear.\u2019 \u2018Let it be so. Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus, I am satisfied to accept his proposal. Tell him, father, as soon as you please, that this was my answer. Repeat it, word for word, if you can, because I should wish him to know what I said.\u2019 \u2018It is quite right, my dear,\u2019 retorted her father approvingly, \u2018to be exact.", " \u2018Rachael,\u2019 Sissy whispered, \u2018I will go on a little by myself.\u2019 She had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when Rachael caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the wide landscape. Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass. They sprang back, and fell upon their knees, each hiding her face upon the other\u2019s neck. \u2018O, my good Lord! He\u2019s down there! Down there!\u2019 At first this, and her terrific screams, were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears, by any prayers, by any representations, by any means. It was impossible to hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she would have flung herself down the shaft. \u2018Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these dreadful cries! Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\u2019 By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of such a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her with a tearless face of stone.", " \u2018What are you talking about? You took her for better for worse.\u2019 \u2018I mun\u2019 be ridden o\u2019 her. I cannot bear \u2019t nommore.

I don\u2019t even go the length of my wages, though they\u2019re not high, ma\u2019am. Why can\u2019t they do as I have done, ma\u2019am? What one person can do, another can do.\u2019 This, again, was among the fictions of Coketown. Any capitalist there, who had made sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, always professed to wonder why the sixty thousand nearest Hands didn\u2019t each make sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, and more or less reproached them every one for not accomplishing the little feat.

First of all, you see our smoke. That\u2019s meat and drink to us. It\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the lungs. If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from you. We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear \u2019em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland.\u2019 By way of \u2018going in\u2019 to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, \u2018Mr. Bounderby, I assure you I am entirely and completely of your way of thinking. On conviction.\u2019 \u2018I am glad to hear it,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018Now, you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills, no doubt. You have? Very good. I\u2019ll state the fact of it to you. It\u2019s the pleasantest work there is, and it\u2019s the lightest work there is, and it\u2019s the best-paid work there is. More than that, we couldn\u2019t improve the mills themselves, unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors.", " Then, why don\u2019t they improve it, ma\u2019am!

I don\u2019t want a wife and family. Why should they?\u2019 \u2018Because they are improvident,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018that\u2019s where it is. If they were more provident and less perverse, ma\u2019am, what would they do?

Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun\u2019s rays. You only knew the town was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town. A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell, or changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:\u2014Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be seen. The wonder was, it was there at all. It had been ruined so often, that it was amazing how it had borne so many shocks.

He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together. Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were so inclined. \u2018Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018as indeed he is of most people.", " The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby\u2019s steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an ecstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment, called to them to stop. \u2018It\u2019s a coincidence,\u2019 exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she was released by the coachman. \u2018It\u2019s a Providence! Come out, ma\u2019am!\u2019 then said Mrs. Sparsit, to some one inside, \u2018come out, or we\u2019ll have you dragged out!\u2019 Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended.

Lo, Louisa coming out of the house! Hastily cloaked and muffled, and stealing away. She elopes! She falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf. Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she struck into a side-path parallel with the ride. Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness. When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped. When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on. She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad. A train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination.", " The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town. It was another red brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and a brazen door-handle full stop. It was a size larger than Mr. Bounderby\u2019s house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes smaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern. Mrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening-tide among the desks and writing implements, she shed a feminine, not to say also aristocratic, grace upon the office. Seated, with her needlework or netting apparatus, at the window, she had a self-laudatory sense of correcting, by her ladylike deportment, the rude business aspect of the place. With this impression of her interesting character upon her, Mrs. Sparsit considered herself, in some sort, the Bank Fairy."], "What does Gradgrindhope Tom will be able to do after Stephen\u2019s death?": [" \u2018Well!\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! When are you off?\u2019 \u2018T\u2019 day\u2019s Monday,\u2019 replied Stephen, considering. \u2018Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh \u2019bout.\u2019 \u2018Friday or Saturday,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Now look here! I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you\u2014that\u2019s my sister, you know, in your room\u2014but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there\u2019s no harm done. So I tell you what. You\u2019ll know our light porter again?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sure,\u2019 said Stephen. \u2018Very well,\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018When you leave work of a night, between this and your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you? Don\u2019t take on, as if you meant anything, if he should see you hanging about there; because I shan\u2019t put him up to speak to you, unless I find I can do you the service I want to do you. In that case he\u2019ll have a note or a message for you, but not else. Now look here! You are sure you understand.\u2019 He had wormed a finger, in the darkness, through a button-hole of Stephen\u2019s coat, and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up round and round, in an extraordinary manner.", " \u2018Do you smoke?\u2019 asked Mr. James Harthouse, when they came to the hotel. \u2018I believe you!\u2019 said Tom. He could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less than go up. What with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as cool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts; Tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and more than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end. Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer.", " I made an exception of you at first. I don\u2019t know what this\u2014jolly old\u2014Jaundiced Jail,\u2019 Tom had paused to find a sufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof, and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of this one, \u2018would be without you.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, Tom? Do you really and truly say so?\u2019 \u2018Why, of course I do. What\u2019s the use of talking about it!\u2019 returned Tom, chafing his face on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison with his spirit. \u2018Because, Tom,\u2019 said his sister, after silently watching the sparks awhile, \u2018as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can\u2019t reconcile you to home better than I am able to do. I don\u2019t know what other girls know. I can\u2019t play to you, or sing to you. I can\u2019t talk to you so as to lighten your mind, for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when you are tired.\u2019 \u2018Well, no more do I. I am as bad as you in that respect; and I am a Mule too, which you\u2019re not.", " Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word. \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you\u2019ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I\u2019ll mention it. Never mind a light, man!\u2019 Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. \u2018It don\u2019t want a light.\u2019 Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand. \u2018I say!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I think I can do you a good turn. Don\u2019t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there\u2019s no harm in my trying.\u2019 His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\u2019s ear, it was so hot. \u2018That was our light porter at the Bank,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018who brought you the message to-night. I call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.\u2019 Stephen thought, \u2018What a hurry he is in!\u2019 He spoke so confusedly."], "What is Bitzer\u2019sdefining characteristic?": [" He is a dissipated, extravagant idler. He is not worth his salt, ma\u2019am. He wouldn\u2019t get it either, if he hadn\u2019t a friend and relation at court, ma\u2019am!\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her head. \u2018I only hope, ma\u2019am,\u2019 pursued Bitzer, \u2018that his friend and relation may not supply him with the means of carrying on. Otherwise, ma\u2019am, we know out of whose pocket _that_ money comes.\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her head. \u2018He is to be pitied, ma\u2019am. The last party I have alluded to, is to be pitied, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Yes, Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018I have always pitied the delusion, always.\u2019 \u2018As to an individual, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, dropping his voice and drawing nearer, \u2018he is as improvident as any of the people in this town. And you know what _their_ improvidence is, ma\u2019am. No one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does.\u2019 \u2018They would do well,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018to take example by you, Bitzer.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am.", " More, far more. Therefore, to my patron I will be scrupulously true. And I do not consider, I will not consider, I cannot consider,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, \u2018that I _should_ be scrupulously true, if I allowed names to be mentioned under this roof, that are unfortunately\u2014most unfortunately\u2014no doubt of that\u2014connected with his.\u2019 Bitzer knuckled his forehead again, and again begged pardon. \u2018No, Bitzer,\u2019 continued Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018say an individual, and I will hear you; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.\u2019 \u2018With the usual exception, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, trying back, \u2018of an individual.\u2019 \u2018Ah\u2014h!\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head over her tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been interrupted. \u2018An individual, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, \u2018has never been what he ought to have been, since he first came into the place.", " \u2018What do you mean, boy?\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018What are you doing? How dare you dash against\u2014everybody\u2014in this manner?\u2019 Bitzer picked up his cap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his forehead, pleaded that it was an accident. \u2018Was this boy running after you, Jupe?\u2019 asked Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 said the girl reluctantly. \u2018No, I wasn\u2019t, sir!\u2019 cried Bitzer. \u2018Not till she run away from me. But the horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; they\u2019re famous for it. You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say,\u2019 addressing Sissy. \u2018It\u2019s as well known in the town as\u2014please, sir, as the multiplication table isn\u2019t known to the horse-riders.\u2019 Bitzer tried Mr. Bounderby with this. \u2018He frightened me so,\u2019 said the girl, \u2018with his cruel faces!\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 cried Bitzer. \u2018Oh! An\u2019t you one of the rest! An\u2019t you a horse-rider! I never looked at her, sir.", " \u2018I\u2019m sorry to interfere with your plans,\u2019 said Bitzer, shaking his head, \u2018but I can\u2019t allow myself to be done by horse-riders. I must have young Mr. Tom; he mustn\u2019t be got away by horse-riders; here he is in a smock frock, and I must have him!\u2019 By the collar, too, it seemed. For, so he took possession of him. CHAPTER VIII PHILOSOPHICAL THEY went back into the booth, Sleary shutting the door to keep intruders out. Bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in the Ring, blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the twilight. \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to him, \u2018have you a heart?\u2019 \u2018The circulation, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the question, \u2018couldn\u2019t be carried on without one. No man, sir, acquainted with the facts established by Harvey relating to the circulation of the blood, can doubt that I have a heart.\u2019 \u2018Is it accessible,\u2019 cried Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018to any compassionate influence?\u2019 \u2018It is accessible to Reason, sir,\u2019 returned the excellent young man."], "Where does Louisaflee after Harthouse\u2019s declaration of love?": [" \u2018Now,\u2019 said Sleary, \u2018come along to the coath, and jump up behind; I\u2019ll go with you there, and they\u2019ll thuppothe you one of my people. Thay farewell to your family, and tharp\u2019th the word.\u2019 With which he delicately retired. \u2018Here is your letter,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018All necessary means will be provided for you. Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the shocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to which it has led. Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive you as I do!\u2019 The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone. But, when Louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh. \u2018Not you. I don\u2019t want to have anything to say to you!\u2019 \u2018O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!\u2019 \u2018After all your love!\u2019 he returned, obdurately. \u2018Pretty love! Leaving old Bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and going home just when I was in the greatest danger.", " Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.\u2019 Silence between them. The deadly statistical clock very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy. \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question. \u2018Well, my child,\u2019 he returned, \u2018I\u2014really\u2014cannot take upon myself to say.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, \u2018do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa, no. No. I ask nothing.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 she still pursued, \u2018does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?\u2019 \u2018Really, my dear,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018it is difficult to answer your question\u2014\u2019 \u2018Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father? \u2018Certainly, my dear. Because;\u2019 here was something to demonstrate, and it set him up again; \u2018because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on the sense in which we use the expression.", " \u2018My dearest love,\u2019 said he, \u2018what could I do? Knowing you were alone, was it possible that I could stay away?\u2019 \u2018You may hang your head, to make yourself the more attractive; _I_ don\u2019t know what they see in you when you hold it up,\u2019 thought Mrs. Sparsit; \u2018but you little think, my dearest love, whose eyes are on you!\u2019 That she hung her head, was certain. She urged him to go away, she commanded him to go away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor raised it. Yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her life. Her hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her manner of speaking was not hurried. \u2018My dear child,\u2019 said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his arm embraced her; \u2018will you not bear with my society for a little while?\u2019 \u2018Not here.\u2019 \u2018Where, Louisa? \u2018Not here.\u2019 \u2018But we have so little time to make so much of, and I have come so far, and am altogether so devoted, and distracted.", " He bit his lip, and took a little time for consideration. \u2018Well! If it should unhappily appear,\u2019 he said, \u2018after due pains and duty on my part, that I am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment, I shall not become the lady\u2019s persecutor. But you said you had no commission from her?\u2019 \u2018I have only the commission of my love for her, and her love for me. I have no other trust, than that I have been with her since she came home, and that she has given me her confidence. I have no further trust, than that I know something of her character and her marriage. O Mr. Harthouse, I think you had that trust too!\u2019 He was touched in the cavity where his heart should have been\u2014in that nest of addled eggs, where the birds of heaven would have lived if they had not been whistled away\u2014by the fervour of this reproach. \u2018I am not a moral sort of fellow,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow."], "What are Sissy\u2019sfather\u2019s first words after he returns to his daughter?": [" I heard you out; hear me out, if you please. Don\u2019t make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency, because, although I am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present position, I should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that. Now, there\u2019s an incompatibility of some sort or another, I am given to understand by you, between your daughter and me. I\u2019ll give _you_ to understand, in reply to that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude\u2014to be summed up in this\u2014that your daughter don\u2019t properly know her husband\u2019s merits, and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her, by George! of the honour of his alliance. That\u2019s plain speaking, I hope.\u2019 \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 urged Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018this is unreasonable.\u2019 \u2018Is it?\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I am glad to hear you say so. Because when Tom Gradgrind, with his new lights, tells me that what I say is unreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible.", " In the extreme sharpness of his look out for base coin, Mr. Kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw anything but money; so Sissy passed him unrecognised, and they went in. The Emperor of Japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled with black spots, was twirling five wash-hand basins at once, as it is the favourite recreation of that monarch to do. Sissy, though well acquainted with his Royal line, had no personal knowledge of the present Emperor, and his reign was peaceful. Miss Josephine Sleary, in her celebrated graceful Equestrian Tyrolean Flower Act, was then announced by a new clown (who humorously said Cauliflower Act), and Mr. Sleary appeared, leading her in. Mr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his long whip-lash, and the Clown had only said, \u2018If you do it again, I\u2019ll throw the horse at you!\u2019 when Sissy was recognised both by father and daughter. But they got through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary, saving for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his locomotive eye than into his fixed one.", " He never used to go there. It was never in his way. His way was the same as mine, and not near it.\u2019 Sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of him. \u2018I doubt,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018if he can be here till next day.\u2019 \u2018Then I will come next night too,\u2019 said Sissy. When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his head, and said to his daughter: \u2018Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man. Do you believe him to be implicated?\u2019 \u2018I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty. I do not believe it now.\u2019 \u2018That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing him to be suspected. His appearance and manner; are they so honest?\u2019 \u2018Very honest.\u2019 \u2018And her confidence not to be shaken! I ask myself,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, musing, \u2018does the real culprit know of these accusations?", " These men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their homes, when Sissy, who had been called away from Louisa some minutes before, returned. \u2018Who is it?\u2019 asked Louisa. \u2018It is Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 said Sissy, timid of the name, \u2018and your brother Mr. Tom, and a young woman who says her name is Rachael, and that you know her.\u2019 \u2018What do they want, Sissy dear?\u2019 \u2018They want to see you. Rachael has been crying, and seems angry.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, for he was present, \u2018I cannot refuse to see them, for a reason that will explain itself. Shall they come in here?\u2019 As he answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away to bring them. She reappeared with them directly. Tom was last; and remained standing in the obscurest part of the room, near the door. \u2018Mrs. Bounderby,\u2019 said her husband, entering with a cool nod, \u2018I don\u2019t disturb you, I hope. This is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary."], "What motivatesHarthouse to become one of Gradgrind\u2019s political disciples?": [" Not until the light porter announced that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself from her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrows\u2014by that time creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs. \u2018O, you Fool!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, when she was alone at her supper. Whom she meant, she did not say; but she could scarcely have meant the sweetbread. CHAPTER II MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE THE Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces. They went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits more hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for anything? Moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were attractive to many of the Gradgrind school. They liked fine gentlemen; they pretended that they did not, but they did. They became exhausted in imitation of them; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like them; and they served out, with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political economy, on which they regaled their disciples.", " \u2018This, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind\u2019s eldest daughter. Loo, Mr. James Harthouse. Mr. Harthouse has joined your father\u2019s muster-roll. If he is not Tom Gradgrind\u2019s colleague before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns. You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior. I don\u2019t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw something in me, I suppose, or she wouldn\u2019t have married me. She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise. If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby.\u2019 To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to learn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended. \u2018Come!\u2019 said his host. \u2018If you\u2019re in the complimentary line, you\u2019ll get on here, for you\u2019ll meet with no competition.", " Now, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than himself, who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore; and had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad, and found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored there; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored everywhere. To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said one day, \u2018Jem, there\u2019s a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and they want men. I wonder you don\u2019t go in for statistics.\u2019 Jem, rather taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as ready to \u2018go in\u2019 for statistics as for anything else. So, he went in. He coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows, and said, \u2018If you want to bring in, for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech, look after my brother Jem, for he\u2019s your man.\u2019 After a few dashes in the public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him down to Coketown, to become known there and in the neighbourhood.", " \u2018You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you are serviceable in the family also; so I understand from Miss Louisa, and, indeed, so I have observed myself. I therefore hope,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018that you can make yourself happy in those relations.\u2019 \u2018I should have nothing to wish, sir, if\u2014\u2019 \u2018I understand you,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind; \u2018you still refer to your father. I have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle. Well! If your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been more successful, you would have been wiser on these points. I will say no more.\u2019 He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must have fallen upon that conclusion. Somehow or other, he had become possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could hardly be set forth in a tabular form."], "Where is the novel set?": [" You have made up your mind,\u2019 said Louisa, still standing before him where she had first stopped\u2014in all the singular contrariety of her self-possession, and her being obviously very ill at ease\u2014\u2018to show the nation the way out of all its difficulties.\u2019 \u2018Mrs. Bounderby,\u2019 he returned, laughing, \u2018upon my honour, no. I will make no such pretence to you. I have seen a little, here and there, up and down; I have found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and as some confess they have, and some do not; and I am going in for your respected father\u2019s opinions\u2014really because I have no choice of opinions, and may as well back them as anything else.\u2019 \u2018Have you none of your own?\u2019 asked Louisa. \u2018I have not so much as the slightest predilection left. I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions. The result of the varieties of boredom I have undergone, is a conviction (unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the subject), that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set, and just as much harm as any other set.", " A flag, floating from the summit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was \u2018Sleary\u2019s Horse-riding\u2019 which claimed their suffrages. Sleary himself, a stout modern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture, took the money. Miss Josephine Sleary, as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act. Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to \u2018elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his highly trained performing dog Merrylegs.\u2019 He was also to exhibit \u2018his astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his head, thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.\u2019 The same Signor Jupe was to \u2018enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.\u2019 Lastly, he was to wind them up by appearing in his favourite character of Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in \u2018the highly novel and laughable hippo-comedietta of The Tailor\u2019s Journey to Brentford.\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects from his thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.", " I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby. Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom\u2019s situation. And I wish to have his situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.\u2019 \u2018If this is solely a question of self-interest with you\u2014\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind began. \u2018I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer; \u2018but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest. What you must always appeal to, is a person\u2019s self-interest. It\u2019s your only hold. We are so constituted. I was brought up in that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are aware.\u2019 \u2018What sum of money,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018will you set against your expected promotion?\u2019 \u2018Thank you, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018for hinting at the proposal; but I will not set any sum against it. Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind; and I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed, would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank.\u2019 \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would have said, See how miserable I am!", " It was only (she observed) because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s time was so very precious, and she knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment, that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his will had been a law to her. \u2018There! Stop where you are, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018stop where you are! Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I believe.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t say that, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity, \u2018because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby. And to be unkind is not to be you, sir.\u2019 \u2018You may set your mind at rest, ma\u2019am.\u2014You can take it very quietly, can\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his wife. \u2018Of course. It is of no moment. Why should it be of any importance to me?\u2019 \u2018Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight."], "What philosophy does Gradgrind promote with his children and at his school?": [" \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby.", " People mutht be amuthed, Thquire, thomehow,\u2019 continued Sleary, rendered more pursy than ever, by so much talking; \u2018they can\u2019t be alwayth a working, nor yet they can\u2019t be alwayth a learning. Make the betht of uth; not the wurtht. I\u2019ve got my living out of the horthe-riding all my life, I know; but I conthider that I lay down the philothophy of the thubject when I thay to you, Thquire, make the betht of uth: not the wurtht!\u2019 The Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs and the fixed eye of Philosophy\u2014and its rolling eye, too\u2014soon lost the three figures and the basket in the darkness of the street. CHAPTER VII MRS. SPARSIT MR. BOUNDERBY being a bachelor, an elderly lady presided over his establishment, in consideration of a certain annual stipend. Mrs. Sparsit was this lady\u2019s name; and she was a prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby\u2019s car, as it rolled along in triumph with the Bully of humility inside.", " I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby. Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom\u2019s situation. And I wish to have his situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.\u2019 \u2018If this is solely a question of self-interest with you\u2014\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind began. \u2018I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer; \u2018but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest. What you must always appeal to, is a person\u2019s self-interest. It\u2019s your only hold. We are so constituted.

You were many years at my school. If, in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son, I entreat and pray you to give him the benefit of that remembrance.\u2019 \u2018I really wonder, sir,\u2019 rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative manner, \u2018to find you taking a position so untenable. My schooling was paid for; it was a bargain; and when I came away, the bargain ended.\u2019 It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid for. Nobody was ever on any account to give anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase. Gratitude was to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be. Every inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a bargain across a counter. And if we didn\u2019t get to Heaven that way, it was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there."], "Who tells Stephen that if he waits outside the bank for several consecutive nights, help will come for him?": [" \u2018In short,\u2019 resumed Tom, as if he had made up his mind, \u2018if you come to that, perhaps I was so far from being altogether in his favour, that I took him outside the door to tell him quietly, that I thought he might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he had got from my sister, and that I hoped he would make good use of it. You remember whether I took him out or not. I say nothing against the man; he may be a very good fellow, for anything I know; I hope he is.\u2019 \u2018Was he offended by what you said?\u2019 \u2018No, he took it pretty well; he was civil enough. Where are you, Loo?\u2019 He sat up in bed and kissed her. \u2018Good night, my dear, good night.\u2019 \u2018You have nothing more to tell me?\u2019 \u2018No. What should I have? You wouldn\u2019t have me tell you a lie!\u2019 \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have you do that to-night, Tom, of all the nights in your life; many and much happier as I hope they will be.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, my dear Loo.", " \u2018And besides,\u2019 said the whelp bitterly, \u2018she tells her own story so precious well\u2014and so full\u2014that what business had I to take it out of her mouth!\u2019 \u2018Say, young lady, if you please,\u2019 pursued Rachael, \u2018why, in an evil hour, you ever came to Stephen\u2019s that night.\u2019 \u2018I felt compassion for him,\u2019 said Louisa, her colour deepening, \u2018and I wished to know what he was going to do, and wished to offer him assistance.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018Much flattered and obliged.\u2019 \u2018Did you offer him,\u2019 asked Rachael, \u2018a bank-note?\u2019 \u2018Yes; but he refused it, and would only take two pounds in gold.\u2019 Rachael cast her eyes towards Mr. Bounderby again. \u2018Oh, certainly!\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018If you put the question whether your ridiculous and improbable account was true or not, I am bound to say it\u2019s confirmed.\u2019 \u2018Young lady,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018Stephen Blackpool is now named as a thief in public print all over this town, and where else!", " He had been trying in vain, for half an hour, to read this newspaper, when the waiter appeared and said, at once mysteriously and apologetically: \u2018Beg your pardon, sir. You\u2019re wanted, sir, if you please.\u2019 A general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to the swell mob, caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return, with bristling indignation, what the Devil he meant by \u2018wanted\u2019? \u2018Beg your pardon, sir. Young lady outside, sir, wishes to see you.\u2019 \u2018Outside? Where?\u2019 \u2018Outside this door, sir.\u2019 Giving the waiter to the personage before mentioned, as a block-head duly qualified for that consignment, Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery. A young woman whom he had never seen stood there. Plainly dressed, very quiet, very pretty. As he conducted her into the room and placed a chair for her, he observed, by the light of the candles, that she was even prettier than he had at first believed.", " Where is he? Who is he?\u2019 His hair had latterly began to change its colour. As he leaned upon his hand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side. Her eyes by accident met Sissy\u2019s at the moment. Sissy flushed and started, and Louisa put her finger on her lip. Next night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that Stephen was not come, she told it in a whisper. Next night again, when she came home with the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke in the same low frightened tone. From the moment of that interchange of looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it. The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and Stephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of. On the fourth day, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to have miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from him with his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road, sixty miles away."], "Who is responsible for stealing from the bank?": [" In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the density of the shrubbery, considering what next? Lo, Louisa coming out of the house! Hastily cloaked and muffled, and stealing away. She elopes! She falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf. Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she struck into a side-path parallel with the ride. Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness. When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped. When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on. She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad. A train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination.", " \u2018Dropped, sir, as if she was shot when I told her! Never knew her do such a thing before. Does her credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!\u2019 She still looked faint and pale. James Harthouse begged her to take his arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her how the robbery had been committed. \u2018Why, I am going to tell you,\u2019 said Bounderby, irritably giving his arm to Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018If you hadn\u2019t been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you before. You know this lady (for she _is_ a lady), Mrs. Sparsit?\u2019 \u2018I have already had the honour\u2014\u2019 \u2018Very well. And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him too on the same occasion?\u2019 Mr. Harthouse inclined his head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his forehead. \u2018Very well. They live at the Bank. You know they live at the Bank, perhaps? Very well. Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything was put away as usual.", " But I touch him up with you when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an understanding. I say! Has father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday, Loo?\u2019 \u2018No, Tom. But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning.\u2019 \u2018Ah! That\u2019s what I mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Do you know where he is to-night?\u2019\u2014with a very deep expression. \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll tell you. He\u2019s with old Bounderby. They are having a regular confab together up at the Bank. Why at the Bank, do you think? Well, I\u2019ll tell you again. To keep Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s ears as far off as possible, I expect.\u2019 With her hand upon her brother\u2019s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire. Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him. \u2018You are very fond of me, an\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 \u2018Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me.\u2019 \u2018Well, sister of mine,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018when you say that, you are near my thoughts.", " Seeing his sister ready to depart, he got up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word. \u2018Just wait a moment, Loo! Before we go, I should like to speak to him a moment. Something comes into my head. If you\u2019ll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I\u2019ll mention it. Never mind a light, man!\u2019 Tom was remarkably impatient of his moving towards the cupboard, to get one. \u2018It don\u2019t want a light.\u2019 Stephen followed him out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his hand. \u2018I say!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I think I can do you a good turn. Don\u2019t ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything. But there\u2019s no harm in my trying.\u2019 His breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen\u2019s ear, it was so hot. \u2018That was our light porter at the Bank,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018who brought you the message to-night. I call him our light porter, because I belong to the Bank too.\u2019 Stephen thought, \u2018What a hurry he is in!\u2019 He spoke so confusedly."], "Who, after the events of the novel, ends up marrying and having a large, loving family?": [" But, happy Sissy\u2019s happy children loving her; all children loving her; she, grown learned in childish lore; thinking no innocent and pretty fancy ever to be despised; trying hard to know her humbler fellow-creatures, and to beautify their lives of machinery and reality with those imaginative graces and delights, without which the heart of infancy will wither up, the sturdiest physical manhood will be morally stark death, and the plainest national prosperity figures can show, will be the Writing on the Wall,\u2014she holding this course as part of no fantastic vow, or bond, or brotherhood, or sisterhood, or pledge, or covenant, or fancy dress, or fancy fair; but simply as a duty to be done,\u2014did Louisa see these things of herself? These things were to be. Dear reader! It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of action, similar things shall be or not. Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn gray and cold.", " Then, why don\u2019t they improve it, ma\u2019am! It\u2019s the first consideration of a rational creature, and it\u2019s what they pretend to want.\u2019 \u2018Pretend indeed!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma\u2019am, till it becomes quite nauseous, concerning their wives and families,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Why look at me, ma\u2019am! I don\u2019t want a wife and family. Why should they?\u2019 \u2018Because they are improvident,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018that\u2019s where it is. If they were more provident and less perverse, ma\u2019am, what would they do? They would say, \u201cWhile my hat covers my family,\u201d or \u201cwhile my bonnet covers my family,\u201d\u2014as the case might be, ma\u2019am\u2014\u201cI have only one to feed, and that\u2019s the person I most like to feed.\u201d\u2019 \u2018To be sure,\u2019 assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin. \u2018Thank you, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Bitzer, knuckling his forehead again, in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s improving conversation.", " In the interest of seeing her, ever drawing, with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new Giant\u2019s Staircase. With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his portrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent. Eager to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for the last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her hopes. Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs; and seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at the figure coming down. CHAPTER XI LOWER AND LOWER THE figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always verging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom. Mr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife\u2019s decease, made an expedition from London, and buried her in a business-like manner. He then returned with promptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes of other people who wanted other odds and ends\u2014in fact resumed his parliamentary duties.", " If you want a speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it. I am not your man. However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused. So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don\u2019t, I can\u2019t help it. I _do_ feel independent. Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter. I am very glad to be so. It has long been my wish to be so. I have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me. At the same time\u2014not to deceive you\u2014I believe I am worthy of her. So, I thank you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present company, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have found."], "Who is the Gradgrind\u2019s eldest son?": [" And I never have, except with looking at him once a year, when he has never knowed it. And it\u2019s right,\u2019 said poor old Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate championship, \u2018that I _should_ keep down in my own part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a many unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my pride in my Josiah to myself, and I can love for love\u2019s own sake! And I am ashamed of you, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Pegler, lastly, \u2018for your slanders and suspicions. And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no. And I shouldn\u2019t be here now, if it hadn\u2019t been for being brought here. And for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my son standing here to tell you so different!\u2019 The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had never ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and larger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short.", " \u2018This, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind\u2019s eldest daughter. Loo, Mr. James Harthouse. Mr. Harthouse has joined your father\u2019s muster-roll. If he is not Tom Gradgrind\u2019s colleague before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns. You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior. I don\u2019t know what she saw in me to marry me, but she saw something in me, I suppose, or she wouldn\u2019t have married me. She has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise. If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby.\u2019 To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he would be more likely to learn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended. \u2018Come!\u2019 said his host. \u2018If you\u2019re in the complimentary line, you\u2019ll get on here, for you\u2019ll meet with no competition.", " In the morning, he went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was opened, and seeing his son\u2019s place empty (he had not the courage to look in at first) went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his way there. To whom he said that, for reasons he would soon explain, but entreated not then to be asked for, he had found it necessary to employ his son at a distance for a little while. Also, that he was charged with the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool\u2019s memory, and declaring the thief. Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street after his father-in-law had left him, swelling like an immense soap-bubble, without its beauty. Mr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his room, and kept it all that day. When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his door, he said, without opening it, \u2018Not now, my dears; in the evening.\u2019 On their return in the evening, he said, \u2018I am not able yet\u2014to-morrow.\u2019 He ate nothing all day, and had no candle after dark; and they heard him walking to and fro late at night.", " He sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical clock, proving something no doubt\u2014probably, in the main, that the Good Samaritan was a Bad Economist. The noise of the rain did not disturb him much; but it attracted his attention sufficiently to make him raise his head sometimes, as if he were rather remonstrating with the elements. When it thundered very loudly, he glanced towards Coketown, having it in his mind that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning. The thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was pouring down like a deluge, when the door of his room opened. He looked round the lamp upon his table, and saw, with amazement, his eldest daughter. \u2018Louisa!\u2019 \u2018Father, I want to speak to you.\u2019 \u2018What is the matter? How strange you look! And good Heaven,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, wondering more and more, \u2018have you come here exposed to this storm?\u2019 She put her hands to her dress, as if she hardly knew."], "What was Sissy's father's profession?": [" \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth.", " I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed. It\u2019s as much as he can do to write; and it\u2019s more than people in general can do to read his writing. Though it\u2019s plain to _me_.\u2019 \u2018Your mother?\u2019 \u2018Father says she was quite a scholar.", " These men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their homes, when Sissy, who had been called away from Louisa some minutes before, returned. \u2018Who is it?\u2019 asked Louisa. \u2018It is Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 said Sissy, timid of the name, \u2018and your brother Mr. Tom, and a young woman who says her name is Rachael, and that you know her.\u2019 \u2018What do they want, Sissy dear?\u2019 \u2018They want to see you. Rachael has been crying, and seems angry.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, for he was present, \u2018I cannot refuse to see them, for a reason that will explain itself. Shall they come in here?\u2019 As he answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away to bring them. She reappeared with them directly. Tom was last; and remained standing in the obscurest part of the room, near the door. \u2018Mrs. Bounderby,\u2019 said her husband, entering with a cool nod, \u2018I don\u2019t disturb you, I hope. This is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary.", " For, Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days, but was highly connected. She had a great aunt living in these very times called Lady Scadgers. Mr. Sparsit, deceased, of whom she was the relict, had been by the mother\u2019s side what Mrs. Sparsit still called \u2018a Powler.\u2019 Strangers of limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not to know what a Powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it might be a business, or a political party, or a profession of faith. The better class of minds, however, did not need to be informed that the Powlers were an ancient stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly far back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost themselves\u2014which they had rather frequently done, as respected horse-flesh, blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary transactions, and the Insolvent Debtors\u2019 Court. The late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother\u2019s side a Powler, married this lady, being by the father\u2019s side a Scadgers."], "Who does Stephen love?": [" \u2018Now,\u2019 said Sleary, \u2018come along to the coath, and jump up behind; I\u2019ll go with you there, and they\u2019ll thuppothe you one of my people. Thay farewell to your family, and tharp\u2019th the word.\u2019 With which he delicately retired. \u2018Here is your letter,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018All necessary means will be provided for you. Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the shocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to which it has led. Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive you as I do!\u2019 The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone. But, when Louisa opened her arms, he repulsed her afresh. \u2018Not you. I don\u2019t want to have anything to say to you!\u2019 \u2018O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!\u2019 \u2018After all your love!\u2019 he returned, obdurately. \u2018Pretty love! Leaving old Bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and going home just when I was in the greatest danger.", " Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.\u2019 Silence between them. The deadly statistical clock very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy. \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question. \u2018Well, my child,\u2019 he returned, \u2018I\u2014really\u2014cannot take upon myself to say.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, \u2018do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa, no. No. I ask nothing.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 she still pursued, \u2018does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?\u2019 \u2018Really, my dear,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018it is difficult to answer your question\u2014\u2019 \u2018Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father? \u2018Certainly, my dear. Because;\u2019 here was something to demonstrate, and it set him up again; \u2018because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on the sense in which we use the expression.", " Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch. So Stephen had expected. Would his servant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him? Message in return, requiring name of such Hand. Stephen Blackpool. There was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might come in. Stephen Blackpool in the parlour. Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by sight), at lunch on chop and sherry. Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup. It was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s dignity and service, not to lunch. She supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own stately person she considered lunch a weakness. \u2018Now, Stephen,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018what\u2019s the matter with _you_?\u2019 Stephen made a bow. Not a servile one\u2014these Hands will never do that! Lord bless you, sir, you\u2019ll never catch them at that, if they have been with you twenty years!\u2014and, as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit, tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.", " \u2018Rachael,\u2019 Sissy whispered, \u2018I will go on a little by myself.\u2019 She had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when Rachael caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the wide landscape. Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass. They sprang back, and fell upon their knees, each hiding her face upon the other\u2019s neck. \u2018O, my good Lord! He\u2019s down there! Down there!\u2019 At first this, and her terrific screams, were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears, by any prayers, by any representations, by any means. It was impossible to hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she would have flung herself down the shaft. \u2018Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these dreadful cries! Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!\u2019 By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of such a moment, Sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her with a tearless face of stone."], "Who is revealed to be Mr. Bounderby's mother?": [" She put the shadow of a hand to her lips again, and recalled her. \u2018You were going to speak to me, mother.\u2019 \u2018Eh? Yes, to be sure, my dear. You know your father is almost always away now, and therefore I must write to him about it.\u2019 \u2018About what, mother? Don\u2019t be troubled. About what?\u2019 \u2018You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have said anything, on any subject, I have never heard the last of it: and consequently, that I have long left off saying anything.\u2019 \u2018I can hear you, mother.\u2019 But, it was only by dint of bending down to her ear, and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved, that she could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion. \u2018You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your brother. Ologies of all kinds from morning to night. If there is any Ology left, of any description, that has not been worn to rags in this house, all I can say is, I hope I shall never hear its name.\u2019 \u2018I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go on.\u2019 This, to keep her from floating away.", " I was so sickly, that I was always moaning and groaning. I was so ragged and dirty, that you wouldn\u2019t have touched me with a pair of tongs.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most appropriate thing her imbecility could think of doing. \u2018How I fought through it, _I_ don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I was determined, I suppose. I have been a determined character in later life, and I suppose I was then.

Tom took his cigar out of his mouth, to shut up his eye (which had grown rather unmanageable) with the greater expression, and to tap his nose several times with his finger. \u2018Mother Sparsit\u2019s feeling for Loo is more than admiration, I should think,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Say affection and devotion. Mother Sparsit never set her cap at Bounderby when he was a bachelor. Oh no!\u2019 These were the last words spoken by the whelp, before a giddy drowsiness came upon him, followed by complete oblivion. He was roused from the latter state by an uneasy dream of being stirred up with a boot, and also of a voice saying: \u2018Come, it\u2019s late. Be off!\u2019 \u2018Well!\u2019 he said, scrambling from the sofa. \u2018I must take my leave of you though. I say. Yours is very good tobacco.

B. Childers, superciliously throwing the interpretation over his shoulder, and accompanying it with a shake of his long hair\u2014which all shook at once. \u2018Now, it\u2019s a remarkable fact, sir, that it cut that man deeper, to know that his daughter knew of his being goosed, than to go through with it.\u2019 \u2018Good!\u2019 interrupted Mr. Bounderby. \u2018This is good, Gradgrind! A man so fond of his daughter, that he runs away from her! This is devilish good! Ha! ha! Now, I\u2019ll tell you what, young man. I haven\u2019t always occupied my present station of life. I know what these things are. You may be astonished to hear it, but my mother\u2014ran away from _me_.\u2019 E. W. B. Childers replied pointedly, that he was not at all astonished to hear it. \u2018Very well,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018I was born in a ditch, and my mother ran away from me.

She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me.

With the people filing off at the door he held, who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole town, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped. Even that unlucky female, Mrs. Sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into the Slough of Despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man and self-made Humbug, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Rachael and Sissy, leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her son\u2019s for that night, walked together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted. Mr. Gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with much interest of Stephen Blackpool; for whom he thought this signal failure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well.", " I was so sickly, that I was always moaning and groaning.

Be buoyant, sir!\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed up by her compassionate eye, could only scratch his head in a feeble and ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning. \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her patron was gone on his journey, and the Bank was closing, \u2018present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas, and ask him if he would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?\u2019 Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and followed on its heels."], "Whose clothes, legs, and shoulders are described as \"square\"?": [" The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s hair, which bristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside. The speaker\u2019s obstinate carriage, square coat, square legs, square shoulders,\u2014nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it was,\u2014all helped the emphasis. \u2018In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but Facts!\u2019 The speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person present, all backed a little, and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of little vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim.

For, although an ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged stool, a dog, and a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great suspense. At last, however, little fair-haired Josephine made her curtsey amid great applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had just warmed himself, and said, \u2018Now _I_\u2019ll have a turn!\u2019 when Sissy was touched on the shoulder, and beckoned out. She took Louisa with her; and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very little private apartment, with canvas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden ceiling all aslant, on which the box company stamped their approbation, as if they were coming through.", " Be sure you know your own mind!\u2019 \u2018When father comes back,\u2019 cried the girl, bursting into tears again after a minute\u2019s silence, \u2018how will he ever find me if I go away!\u2019 \u2018You may be quite at ease,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, calmly; he worked out the whole matter like a sum: \u2018you may be quite at ease, Jupe, on that score.

His legs were very robust, but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been. His chest and back were as much too broad, as his legs were too short. He was dressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting trousers; wore a shawl round his neck; smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses\u2019 provender, and sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur, compounded of the stable and the play-house. Where the one began, and the other ended, nobody could have told with any precision. This gentleman was mentioned in the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B. Childers, so justly celebrated for his daring vaulting act as the Wild Huntsman of the North American Prairies; in which popular performance, a diminutive boy with an old face, who now accompanied him, assisted as his infant son: being carried upside down over his father\u2019s shoulder, by one foot, and held by the crown of his head, heels upwards, in the palm of his father\u2019s hand, according to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be observed to fondle their offspring."], "By the end of the novel, Mr. Gradgrind has changed his philosophy, \"making his facts and figures subservient to ___.\u201d": [" Probably not. Yet the portrait was to see it all out. Here was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day, and in the same hour, sitting thoughtful in his own room. How much of futurity did _he_ see?

Did he catch sight of himself, therefore much despised by his late political associates? Did he see them, in the era of its being quite settled that the national dustmen have only to do with one another, and owe no duty to an abstraction called a People, \u2018taunting the honourable gentleman\u2019 with this and with that and with what not, five nights a-week, until the small hours of the morning?

In such terms, no doubt, substituting the words \u2018boys and girls,\u2019 for \u2018sir,\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers before him, who were to be filled so full of facts.", " People mutht be amuthed, Thquire, thomehow,\u2019 continued Sleary, rendered more pursy than ever, by so much talking; \u2018they can\u2019t be alwayth a working, nor yet they can\u2019t be alwayth a learning.

All that is difficult to me now, would be so easy then.\u2019 \u2018You might not be the better for it, Sissy.\u2019 Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, \u2018I should not be the worse, Miss Louisa.\u2019 To which Miss Louisa answered, \u2018I don\u2019t know that.\u2019 There had been so little communication between these two\u2014both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition relative to Sissy\u2019s past career\u2014that they were still almost strangers.

What those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did. Gold and silver coin, precious paper, secrets that if divulged would bring vague destruction upon vague persons (generally, however, people whom she disliked), were the chief items in her ideal catalogue thereof. For the rest, she knew that after office-hours, she reigned supreme over all the office furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three locks, against the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his head every night, on a truckle bed, that disappeared at cockcrow. Further, she was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply spiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the relics of the current day\u2019s work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out pens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit tried.", " Louisa languidly leaned upon the window looking out, without looking at anything, while young Thomas stood sniffing revengefully at the fire. Adam Smith and Malthus, two younger Gradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody; and little Jane, after manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay on her face with slate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions. \u2018It\u2019s all right now, Louisa: it\u2019s all right, young Thomas,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby; \u2018you won\u2019t do so any more.

Well, Louisa, that\u2019s worth a kiss, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 returned Louisa, when she had coldly paused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him, with her face turned away. \u2018Always my pet; ain\u2019t you, Louisa?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Good-bye, Louisa!\u2019 He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red.", " Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.\u2019 Silence between them. The deadly statistical clock very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy. \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question. \u2018Well, my child,\u2019 he returned, \u2018I\u2014really\u2014cannot take upon myself to say.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, \u2018do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa, no. No. I ask nothing.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 she still pursued, \u2018does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?\u2019 \u2018Really, my dear,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018it is difficult to answer your question\u2014\u2019 \u2018Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father? \u2018Certainly, my dear.

Devilish high society,\u2019 he said, warming his legs. \u2018It is true, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with an affectation of humility the very opposite of his, and therefore in no danger of jostling it. \u2018You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a kind of social widowhood upon her. \u2018It is unquestionably true.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his legs in his great satisfaction and laughed aloud. Mr. and Miss Gradgrind being then announced, he received the former with a shake of the hand, and the latter with a kiss. \u2018Can Jupe be sent here, Bounderby?\u2019 asked Mr. Gradgrind. Certainly. So Jupe was sent there. On coming in, she curtseyed to Mr. Bounderby, and to his friend Tom Gradgrind, and also to Louisa; but in her confusion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit.

However improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago, that he would ever become my patron, making me an annual compliment, I cannot but regard him in that light.

How much of the future might arise before _her_ vision? Broadsides in the streets, signed with her father\u2019s name, exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool, weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own son, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not bring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the Present. So, Stephen Blackpool\u2019s tombstone, with her father\u2019s record of his death, was almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be. These things she could plainly see. But, how much of the Future? A working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once again appearing at the ringing of the Factory bell, and passing to and fro at the set hours, among the Coketown Hands; a woman of pensive beauty, always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and even cheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have compassion on a degraded, drunken wretch of her own sex, who was sometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her, and crying to her; a woman working, ever working, but content to do it, and preferring to do it as her natural lot, until she should be too old to labour any more?", " It was an old woman, tall and shapely still, though withered by time, on whom his eyes fell when he stopped and turned. She was very cleanly and plainly dressed, had country mud upon her shoes, and was newly come from a journey. The flutter of her manner, in the unwonted noise of the streets; the spare shawl, carried unfolded on her arm; the heavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered gloves, to which her hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman from the country, in her plain holiday clothes, come into Coketown on an expedition of rare occurrence. Remarking this at a glance, with the quick observation of his class, Stephen Blackpool bent his attentive face\u2014his face, which, like the faces of many of his order, by dint of long working with eyes and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the concentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the deaf\u2014the better to hear what she asked him.", " The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round the placards, devouring them with eager eyes. Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read. These people, as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud\u2014there was always some such ready to help them\u2014stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil. Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling wheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets, there were still as many readers as before. Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had brought it in his pocket.", " The solitary exception was the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door, terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs. All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe characters of black and white. The jail might have been the infirmary, the infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been either, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction. Fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the immaterial.

What is called Taste, is only another name for Fact.\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind nodded his approbation. \u2018This is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,\u2019 said the gentleman. \u2018Now, I\u2019ll try you again. Suppose you were going to carpet a room. Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it?\u2019 There being a general conviction by this time that \u2018No, sir!\u2019 was always the right answer to this gentleman, the chorus of NO was very strong.

Sissy was at her mother\u2019s side; and Jane, her sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in the room. There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind that her eldest child was there. She reclined, propped up, from mere habit, on a couch: as nearly in her old usual attitude, as anything so helpless could be kept in. She had positively refused to take to her bed; on the ground that if she did, she would never hear the last of it. Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom of a well. The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had been: which had much to do with it. On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she replied, at cross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since he married Louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable name, she had called him J; and that she could not at present depart from that regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.", " These men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their homes, when Sissy, who had been called away from Louisa some minutes before, returned. \u2018Who is it?\u2019 asked Louisa. \u2018It is Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 said Sissy, timid of the name, \u2018and your brother Mr. Tom, and a young woman who says her name is Rachael, and that you know her.\u2019 \u2018What do they want, Sissy dear?\u2019 \u2018They want to see you. Rachael has been crying, and seems angry.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, for he was present, \u2018I cannot refuse to see them, for a reason that will explain itself. Shall they come in here?\u2019 As he answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away to bring them. She reappeared with them directly. Tom was last; and remained standing in the obscurest part of the room, near the door. \u2018Mrs. Bounderby,\u2019 said her husband, entering with a cool nod, \u2018I don\u2019t disturb you, I hope. This is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary.", " \u2018A very good fellow indeed!\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018You think so, don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Tom. And shut up his eye again. Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: \u2018What a comical brother-in-law you are!\u2019 \u2018What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\u2019 retorted Mr. James Harthouse. There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. \u2018Oh! I don\u2019t care for old Bounderby,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you mean that.

Did he see any faint reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking upon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend a Bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster?

Without a candle in the room, Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her, not thinking much of the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street cries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by, the shutting-up of shop-shutters.", " No implicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying step.

He drew up a placard, offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool, suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height, and manner, as minutely as he could; he recited how he had left the town, and in what direction he had been last seen going; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow.", " \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect.

Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward.", " She was still doing this, five minutes afterwards. \u2018What are you about, Loo?\u2019 her brother sulkily remonstrated. \u2018You\u2019ll rub a hole in your face.\u2019 \u2018You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like, Tom. I wouldn\u2019t cry!\u2019 CHAPTER V THE KEYNOTE COKETOWN, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a triumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself. Let us strike the key-note, Coketown, before pursuing our tune. It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage. It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled. It had a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness."], "Mrs. Sparsit imagines Louisa's relationship with Harthouse as running down a long staircase into a \"dark pit of ____.\"": [" So when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day before her departure, \u2018I tell you what, ma\u2019am; you shall come down here of a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.\u2019 To which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan persuasion: \u2018To hear is to obey.\u2019 Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy, into her head. Much watching of Louisa, and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s edge, must have given her as it were a lift, in the way of inspiration. She erected in her mind a mighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa coming. It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s life, to look up at her staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.", " \u2018Mr. Thomas,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018these plain viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\u2019 \u2018Thank\u2019ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\u2019 said the whelp. And gloomily fell to. \u2018How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Where may he be at present?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative. \u2018He is shooting in Yorkshire,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church, yesterday.\u2019 \u2018The kind of gentleman, now,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, \u2018whom one might wager to be a good shot!\u2019 \u2018Crack,\u2019 said Tom. He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together. Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were so inclined. \u2018Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018as indeed he is of most people.", " I have talked it over with my friend Tom more than once\u2014of course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with Tom\u2014and he is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of his. Will you walk?\u2019 They strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the twilight\u2014she leaning on his arm\u2014and she little thought how she was going down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s staircase. Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing. When Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it would; but, until then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s eyes. And there Louisa always was, upon it. And always gliding down, down, down! Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of compunction, all absorbed in interest.", " In the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward. Separated from her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through James Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs. \u2018Your foot on the last step, my lady,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing the descending figure, with the aid of her threatening mitten, \u2018and all your art shall never blind me.\u2019 Art or nature though, the original stock of Louisa\u2019s character or the graft of circumstances upon it,\u2014her curious reserve did baffle, while it stimulated, one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit. There were times when Mr. James Harthouse was not sure of her. There were times when he could not read the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of satellites to help her."], "Mr. Gradgrind claims that nothing will ever be of service to children except for ___.": [" Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them. This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these children. Stick to Facts, sir!\u2019 The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room, and the speaker\u2019s square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring every sentence with a line on the schoolmaster\u2019s sleeve. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s square wall of a forehead, which had his eyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves, overshadowed by the wall. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set. The emphasis was helped by the speaker\u2019s voice, which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial.", " I myself had not been at home many hours, when I received her\u2014here, in this room. She hurried by the train to town, she ran from town to this house, through a raging storm, and presented herself before me in a state of distraction. Of course, she has remained here ever since. Let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to be more quiet.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him for some moments, in every direction except Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s direction; and then, abruptly turning upon the niece of Lady Scadgers, said to that wretched woman: \u2018Now, ma\u2019am! We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer, for going about the country at express pace, with no other luggage than a Cock-and-a-Bull, ma\u2019am!\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 whispered Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018my nerves are at present too much shaken, and my health is at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears.\u2019 (Which she did.)", " Did he catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers, as the rising young man, so devoted to his master\u2019s great merits, who had won young Tom\u2019s place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when by various rascals he was spirited away? Did he see any faint reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking upon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend a Bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster? Had he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street, and this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile example, little service and much law?", " \u2018You couldn\u2019t put it clearer, I am sure, ma\u2019am.\u2019 As this was his usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he had already caught her eye and seen that she was going to ask him something, he made a pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street. \u2018Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Not a very busy day, my lady. About an average day.\u2019 He now and then slided into my lady, instead of ma\u2019am, as an involuntary acknowledgment of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s personal dignity and claims to reverence. \u2018The clerks,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible crumb of bread and butter from her left-hand mitten, \u2018are trustworthy, punctual, and industrious, of course?\u2019 \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am, pretty fair, ma\u2019am. With the usual exception.\u2019 He held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the establishment, for which volunteer service he received a present at Christmas, over and above his weekly wage."], "Who does Mr. Gradgrind hire to become a teacher at his school?": [" \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby.", " I asked her if she would know how to define a horse to-morrow, and offered to tell her again, and she ran away, and I ran after her, sir, that she might know how to answer when she was asked. You wouldn\u2019t have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn\u2019t been a horse-rider?\u2019 \u2018Her calling seems to be pretty well known among \u2019em,\u2019 observed Mr. Bounderby. \u2018You\u2019d have had the whole school peeping in a row, in a week.\u2019 \u2018Truly, I think so,\u2019 returned his friend. \u2018Bitzer, turn you about and take yourself home. Jupe, stay here a moment. Let me hear of your running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the master of the school. You understand what I mean. Go along.\u2019 The boy stopped in his rapid blinking, knuckled his forehead again, glanced at Sissy, turned about, and retreated. \u2018Now, girl,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018take this gentleman and me to your father\u2019s; we are going there.", " That\u2019s what _I_ call education.\u2019 \u2018I think your good sense will perceive,\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind remonstrated in all humility, \u2018that whatever the merits of such a system may be, it would be difficult of general application to girls.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t see it at all, sir,\u2019 returned the obstinate Bounderby. \u2018Well,\u2019 sighed Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018we will not enter into the question. I assure you I have no desire to be controversial. I seek to repair what is amiss, if I possibly can; and I hope you will assist me in a good spirit, Bounderby, for I have been very much distressed.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t understand you, yet,\u2019 said Bounderby, with determined obstinacy, \u2018and therefore I won\u2019t make any promises.\u2019 \u2018In the course of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind proceeded, in the same depressed and propitiatory manner, \u2018I appear to myself to have become better informed as to Louisa\u2019s character, than in previous years. The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and the discovery is not mine.", " \u2018You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and (in a generally pervading way) you are serviceable in the family also; so I understand from Miss Louisa, and, indeed, so I have observed myself. I therefore hope,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018that you can make yourself happy in those relations.\u2019 \u2018I should have nothing to wish, sir, if\u2014\u2019 \u2018I understand you,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind; \u2018you still refer to your father. I have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle. Well! If your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been more successful, you would have been wiser on these points. I will say no more.\u2019 He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her; otherwise he held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must have fallen upon that conclusion. Somehow or other, he had become possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could hardly be set forth in a tabular form."], "What is the name of the Gradgrind home?": [" Since the time of her leaving home, Sissy had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms. Sissy was at her mother\u2019s side; and Jane, her sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in the room. There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind that her eldest child was there. She reclined, propped up, from mere habit, on a couch: as nearly in her old usual attitude, as anything so helpless could be kept in. She had positively refused to take to her bed; on the ground that if she did, she would never hear the last of it. Her feeble voice sounded so far away in her bundle of shawls, and the sound of another voice addressing her seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her ears, that she might have been lying at the bottom of a well. The poor lady was nearer Truth than she ever had been: which had much to do with it. On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she replied, at cross-purposes, that she had never called him by that name since he married Louisa; that pending her choice of an objectionable name, she had called him J; and that she could not at present depart from that regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.", " A man of realities. A man of facts and calculations. A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are four, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for anything over.

It is a mere question of figures, a case of simple arithmetic. You might hope to get some other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or Augustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind (all supposititious, non-existent persons), but into the head of Thomas Gradgrind\u2014no, sir! In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether to his private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general. In such terms, no doubt, substituting the words \u2018boys and girls,\u2019 for \u2018sir,\u2019 Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers before him, who were to be filled so full of facts.", " Her manner was short and abrupt, yet faltering and timid. \u2018He has told you what has passed between himself and my husband? You would be his first resource, I think.\u2019 \u2018I have heard the end of it, young lady,\u2019 said Rachael. \u2018Did I understand, that, being rejected by one employer, he would probably be rejected by all? I thought he said as much?\u2019 \u2018The chances are very small, young lady\u2014next to nothing\u2014for a man who gets a bad name among them.\u2019 \u2018What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name?\u2019 \u2018The name of being troublesome.\u2019 \u2018Then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the other, he is sacrificed alike? Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?\u2019 Rachael shook her head in silence. \u2018He fell into suspicion,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018with his fellow-weavers, because\u2014he had made a promise not to be one of them.", " He has been very silent and doleful of late. Perhaps, his brotherly conscience is touched\u2014if there are such things as consciences. Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too often to believe in them.\u2019 He assisted her to rise, and she took his arm, and they advanced to meet the whelp. He was idly beating the branches as he lounged along: or he stooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his stick. He was startled when they came upon him while he was engaged in this latter pastime, and his colour changed. \u2018Halloa!\u2019 he stammered; \u2018I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u2019 \u2018Whose name, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse, putting his hand upon his shoulder and turning him, so that they all three walked towards the house together, \u2018have you been carving on the trees?\u2019 \u2018Whose name?\u2019 returned Tom. \u2018Oh! You mean what girl\u2019s name?\u2019 \u2018You have a suspicious appearance of inscribing some fair creature\u2019s on the bark, Tom.\u2019 [Picture: Mr. Harthouse and Tom Gradgrind in the garden] \u2018Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her own disposal would take a fancy to me."], "What does Mr. Gradgrind catch Tom and Luisa spying on?": [" \u2018Do you smoke?\u2019 asked Mr. James Harthouse, when they came to the hotel. \u2018I believe you!\u2019 said Tom. He could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less than go up. What with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as cool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts; Tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and more than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end. Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer.", " \u2018A very good fellow indeed!\u2019 returned Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018You think so, don\u2019t you?\u2019 said Tom. And shut up his eye again. Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his end of the sofa, and lounging with his back against the chimney-piece, so that he stood before the empty fire-grate as he smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him, observed: \u2018What a comical brother-in-law you are!\u2019 \u2018What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is, I think you mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018You are a piece of caustic, Tom,\u2019 retorted Mr. James Harthouse. There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. \u2018Oh! I don\u2019t care for old Bounderby,\u2019 said he, \u2018if you mean that. I have always called old Bounderby by the same name when I have talked about him, and I have always thought of him in the same way.", " Tom Gradgrind, as your son, young Tom, refuses for some obstinate reason or other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, I am obliged to confront her with your daughter.\u2019 \u2018You have seen me once before, young lady,\u2019 said Rachael, standing in front of Louisa. Tom coughed. \u2018You have seen me, young lady,\u2019 repeated Rachael, as she did not answer, \u2018once before.\u2019 Tom coughed again. \u2018I have.\u2019 Rachael cast her eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby, and said, \u2018Will you make it known, young lady, where, and who was there?\u2019 \u2018I went to the house where Stephen Blackpool lodged, on the night of his discharge from his work, and I saw you there. He was there too; and an old woman who did not speak, and whom I could scarcely see, stood in a dark corner. My brother was with me.\u2019 \u2018Why couldn\u2019t you say so, young Tom?\u2019 demanded Bounderby. \u2018I promised my sister I wouldn\u2019t.\u2019 Which Louisa hastily confirmed.", " Is it a secret?\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said Tom, \u2018if it is a secret, it\u2019s not far off. It\u2019s you. You are his little pet, you are his favourite; he\u2019ll do anything for you. When he says to me what I don\u2019t like, I shall say to him, \u201cMy sister Loo will be hurt and disappointed, Mr. Bounderby. She always used to tell me she was sure you would be easier with me than this.\u201d That\u2019ll bring him about, or nothing will.\u2019 After waiting for some answering remark, and getting none, Tom wearily relapsed into the present time, and twined himself yawning round and about the rails of his chair, and rumpled his head more and more, until he suddenly looked up, and asked: \u2018Have you gone to sleep, Loo?\u2019 \u2018No, Tom. I am looking at the fire.\u2019 \u2018You seem to find more to look at in it than ever I could find,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Another of the advantages, I suppose, of being a girl.\u2019 \u2018Tom,\u2019 enquired his sister, slowly, and in a curious tone, as if she were reading what she asked in the fire, and it was not quite plainly written there, \u2018do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr. Bounderby\u2019s?\u2019 \u2018Why, there\u2019s one thing to be said of it,\u2019 returned Tom, pushing his chair from him, and standing up; \u2018it will be getting away from home.\u2019 \u2018There is one thing to be said of it,\u2019 Louisa repeated in her former curious tone; \u2018it will be getting away from home."], "Mrs. Gradgrind shoos her children away, telling them to, \"go and be ____.\"": [" He frowned impatiently. \u2018As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldn\u2019t go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of circuses!\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018You know, as well as I do, no young people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend lectures about circuses. What can you possibly want to know of circuses then? I am sure you have enough to do, if that\u2019s what you want. With my head in its present state, I couldn\u2019t remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the reason!\u2019 pouted Louisa. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s the reason, because it can\u2019t be nothing of the sort,\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018Go and be somethingological directly.\u2019 Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit.

She urged him to go away, she commanded him to go away; but she neither turned her face to him, nor raised it. Yet it was remarkable that she sat as still as ever the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her sit, at any period in her life. Her hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her manner of speaking was not hurried. \u2018My dear child,\u2019 said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his arm embraced her; \u2018will you not bear with my society for a little while?\u2019 \u2018Not here.\u2019 \u2018Where, Louisa? \u2018Not here.\u2019 \u2018But we have so little time to make so much of, and I have come so far, and am altogether so devoted, and distracted.", " My dearest Louisa, I cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of your power.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit saw him detain her with his encircling arm, and heard him then and there, within her (Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s) greedy hearing, tell her how he loved her, and how she was the stake for which he ardently desired to play away all that he had in life. The objects he had lately pursued, turned worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he flung away from him like the dirt it was, compared with her. Its pursuit, nevertheless, if it kept him near her, or its renunciation if it took him from her, or flight if she shared it, or secrecy if she commanded it, or any fate, or every fate, all was alike to him, so that she was true to him,\u2014the man who had seen how cast away she was, whom she had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of which he had thought himself incapable, whom she had received into her confidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.", " So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or four days. It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank, adding: \u2018But you\u2019ll go down to-morrow, ma\u2019am, all the same. You\u2019ll go down just as if I was there. It will make no difference to you.\u2019 \u2018Pray, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, \u2018let me beg you not to say that. Your absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as I think you very well know.\u2019 \u2018Well, ma\u2019am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, not displeased. \u2018Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 retorted Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018your will is to me a law, sir; otherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality."], "What is Sissy out buying when her father leaves?": [" \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth.", " She died when I was born. She was;\u2019 Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; \u2018she was a dancer.\u2019 \u2018Did your father love her?\u2019 Louisa asked these questions with a strong, wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and hiding in solitary places. \u2018O yes! As dearly as he loves me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from that time.\u2019 \u2018Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do. When he left me for my good\u2014he never would have left me for his own\u2014I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial. He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back.\u2019 \u2018Tell me more about him,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018I will never ask you again. Where did you live?\u2019 \u2018We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in.", " I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed. It\u2019s as much as he can do to write; and it\u2019s more than people in general can do to read his writing. Though it\u2019s plain to _me_.\u2019 \u2018Your mother?\u2019 \u2018Father says she was quite a scholar.", " Louisa had known it, and seen it, without looking at her. From that moment she was impassive, proud and cold\u2014held Sissy at a distance\u2014changed to her altogether. CHAPTER XVI HUSBAND AND WIFE MR. BOUNDERBY\u2019S first disquietude on hearing of his happiness, was occasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit. He could not make up his mind how to do that, or what the consequences of the step might be. Whether she would instantly depart, bag and baggage, to Lady Scadgers, or would positively refuse to budge from the premises; whether she would be plaintive or abusive, tearful or tearing; whether she would break her heart, or break the looking-glass; Mr. Bounderby could not all foresee. However, as it must be done, he had no choice but to do it; so, after attempting several letters, and failing in them all, he resolved to do it by word of mouth. On his way home, on the evening he set aside for this momentous purpose, he took the precaution of stepping into a chemist\u2019s shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest smelling-salts."], "Who is the master of the circus?": [" There!\u2019 said the old woman to Stephen, \u2018you can make all the rest out for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!\u2019 Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike this old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly could be. With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in her old age. \u2018Well, missus,\u2019 said he, \u2018I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom. Wi\u2019 fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha never seen the like on.\u2019 \u2018Young and handsome. Yes!\u2019 cried the old woman, quite delighted. \u2018As bonny as a rose! And what a happy wife!\u2019 \u2018Aye, missus, I suppose she be,\u2019 said Stephen. But with a doubtful glance at Rachael. \u2018Suppose she be? She must be. She\u2019s your master\u2019s wife,\u2019 returned the old woman. Stephen nodded assent. \u2018Though as to master,\u2019 said he, glancing again at Rachael, \u2018not master onny more.", " Else wherefore live we in a Christian land, eighteen hundred and odd years after our Master? All this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the grate, and became extinct, that from the period when her father had said she was almost a young woman\u2014which seemed but yesterday\u2014she had scarcely attracted his notice again, when he found her quite a young woman. \u2018Quite a young woman,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, musing. \u2018Dear me!\u2019 Soon after this discovery, he became more thoughtful than usual for several days, and seemed much engrossed by one subject. On a certain night, when he was going out, and Louisa came to bid him good-bye before his departure\u2014as he was not to be home until late and she would not see him again until the morning\u2014he held her in his arms, looking at her in his kindest manner, and said: \u2018My dear Louisa, you are a woman!\u2019 She answered with the old, quick, searching look of the night when she was found at the Circus; then cast down her eyes.", " \u2018Kidderminster, stow that!\u2019 said Mr. Childers. (Master Kidderminster was Cupid\u2019s mortal name.) \u2018What does he come here cheeking us for, then?\u2019 cried Master Kidderminster, showing a very irascible temperament. \u2018If you want to cheek us, pay your ochre at the doors and take it out.\u2019 \u2018Kidderminster,\u2019 said Mr. Childers, raising his voice, \u2018stow that!\u2014Sir,\u2019 to Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018I was addressing myself to you. You may or you may not be aware (for perhaps you have not been much in the audience), that Jupe has missed his tip very often, lately.\u2019 \u2018Has\u2014what has he missed?\u2019 asked Mr. Gradgrind, glancing at the potent Bounderby for assistance. \u2018Missed his tip.\u2019 \u2018Offered at the Garters four times last night, and never done \u2019em once,\u2019 said Master Kidderminster. \u2018Missed his tip at the banners, too, and was loose in his ponging.\u2019 \u2018Didn\u2019t do what he ought to do. Was short in his leaps and bad in his tumbling,\u2019 Mr. Childers interpreted.", " Mr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards. He too had encountered no one whom he knew; and was now sanguine with Sleary\u2019s assistance, of getting his disgraced son to Liverpool in the night. As neither of the three could be his companion without almost identifying him under any disguise, he prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he could trust, beseeching him to ship the bearer off at any cost, to North or South America, or any distant part of the world to which he could be the most speedily and privately dispatched. This done, they walked about, waiting for the Circus to be quite vacated; not only by the audience, but by the company and by the horses. After watching it a long time, they saw Mr. Sleary bring out a chair and sit down by the side-door, smoking; as if that were his signal that they might approach. \u2018Your thervant, Thquire,\u2019 was his cautious salutation as they passed in."], "Sissy agrees to go live with the Gradgrinds, largely because she thinks ___.": [" However, when I go to live with old Bounderby, I\u2019ll have my revenge.\u2019 \u2018Your revenge, Tom?\u2019 \u2018I mean, I\u2019ll enjoy myself a little, and go about and see something, and hear something. I\u2019ll recompense myself for the way in which I have been brought up.\u2019 \u2018But don\u2019t disappoint yourself beforehand, Tom. Mr. Bounderby thinks as father thinks, and is a great deal rougher, and not half so kind.\u2019 \u2018Oh!\u2019 said Tom, laughing; \u2018I don\u2019t mind that. I shall very well know how to manage and smooth old Bounderby!\u2019 Their shadows were defined upon the wall, but those of the high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling, as if the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern. Or, a fanciful imagination\u2014if such treason could have been there\u2014might have made it out to be the shadow of their subject, and of its lowering association with their future. \u2018What is your great mode of smoothing and managing, Tom?", " Gas and ventilation, drainage and water-service, all of the primest quality. Iron clamps and girders, fire-proof from top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with all their brushes and brooms; everything that heart could desire. Everything? Well, I suppose so. The little Gradgrinds had cabinets in various departments of science too. They had a little conchological cabinet, and a little metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical cabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the bits of stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the parent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names; and, to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper, who had never found his way into their nursery, If the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at more than this, what was it for good gracious goodness\u2019 sake, that the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped it!", " CHAPTER III A LOOPHOLE MR. GRADGRIND walked homeward from the school, in a state of considerable satisfaction. It was his school, and he intended it to be a model. He intended every child in it to be a model\u2014just as the young Gradgrinds were all models. There were five young Gradgrinds, and they were models every one. They had been lectured at, from their tenderest years; coursed, like little hares. Almost as soon as they could run alone, they had been made to run to the lecture-room. The first object with which they had an association, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board with a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it. Not that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an Ogre Fact forbid! I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle, with Heaven knows how many heads manipulated into one, taking childhood captive, and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair.", " She died when I was born.

It\u2019s the first consideration of a rational creature, and it\u2019s what they pretend to want.\u2019 \u2018Pretend indeed!\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma\u2019am, till it becomes quite nauseous, concerning their wives and families,\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018Why look at me, ma\u2019am! I don\u2019t want a wife and family. Why should they?\u2019 \u2018Because they are improvident,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Yes, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018that\u2019s where it is. If they were more provident and less perverse, ma\u2019am, what would they do?

I think he married Gradgrind\u2019s daughter?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, suddenly compressing her mouth, \u2018he had that\u2014honour.\u2019 \u2018The lady is quite a philosopher, I am told?\u2019 \u2018Indeed, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018_Is_ she?\u2019 \u2018Excuse my impertinent curiosity,\u2019 pursued the stranger, fluttering over Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s eyebrows, with a propitiatory air, \u2018but you know the family, and know the world. I am about to know the family, and may have much to do with them. Is the lady so very alarming? Her father gives her such a portentously hard-headed reputation, that I have a burning desire to know. Is she absolutely unapproachable? Repellently and stunningly clever? I see, by your meaning smile, you think not. You have poured balm into my anxious soul. As to age, now. Forty? Five and thirty?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright. \u2018A chit,\u2019 said she.", " \u2018Mr. Thomas,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018these plain viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\u2019 \u2018Thank\u2019ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\u2019 said the whelp. And gloomily fell to. \u2018How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Where may he be at present?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative. \u2018He is shooting in Yorkshire,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church, yesterday.\u2019 \u2018The kind of gentleman, now,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, \u2018whom one might wager to be a good shot!\u2019 \u2018Crack,\u2019 said Tom. He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together. Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were so inclined. \u2018Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018as indeed he is of most people.", " The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby\u2019s steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an ecstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment, called to them to stop. \u2018It\u2019s a coincidence,\u2019 exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she was released by the coachman. \u2018It\u2019s a Providence! Come out, ma\u2019am!\u2019 then said Mrs. Sparsit, to some one inside, \u2018come out, or we\u2019ll have you dragged out!\u2019 Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended.

But I get hope and strength through you; and you believe that though appearances may rise against him, he will be proved clear?\u2019 \u2018I do believe so,\u2019 returned Sissy, \u2018with my whole heart.", " I made an exception of you at first. I don\u2019t know what this\u2014jolly old\u2014Jaundiced Jail,\u2019 Tom had paused to find a sufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof, and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of this one, \u2018would be without you.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, Tom? Do you really and truly say so?\u2019 \u2018Why, of course I do. What\u2019s the use of talking about it!\u2019 returned Tom, chafing his face on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison with his spirit. \u2018Because, Tom,\u2019 said his sister, after silently watching the sparks awhile, \u2018as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can\u2019t reconcile you to home better than I am able to do. I don\u2019t know what other girls know. I can\u2019t play to you, or sing to you. I can\u2019t talk to you so as to lighten your mind, for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when you are tired.\u2019 \u2018Well, no more do I. I am as bad as you in that respect; and I am a Mule too, which you\u2019re not."], "What is Stephen Blackpool's job at the factory?": [" Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch. So Stephen had expected. Would his servant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him? Message in return, requiring name of such Hand. Stephen Blackpool. There was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might come in. Stephen Blackpool in the parlour. Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by sight), at lunch on chop and sherry. Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup. It was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s dignity and service, not to lunch. She supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own stately person she considered lunch a weakness. \u2018Now, Stephen,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018what\u2019s the matter with _you_?\u2019 Stephen made a bow. Not a servile one\u2014these Hands will never do that! Lord bless you, sir, you\u2019ll never catch them at that, if they have been with you twenty years!\u2014and, as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit, tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.", " No implicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying step. More remarkable yet, Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and the mysterious old woman remained a mystery. Things having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it, the upshot of Mr. Bounderby\u2019s investigations was, that he resolved to hazard a bold burst. He drew up a placard, offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool, suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height, and manner, as minutely as he could; he recited how he had left the town, and in what direction he had been last seen going; he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow.", " \u2018You hear what this lady asks. Was it an unequal marriage in point of years, this unlucky job of yours?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Not e\u2019en so. I were one-and-twenty myseln; she were twenty nighbut.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, sir?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit to her Chief, with great placidity. \u2018I inferred, from its being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an unequal one in point of years.\u2019 Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that had an odd sheepishness about it. He fortified himself with a little more sherry. \u2018Well? Why don\u2019t you go on?\u2019 he then asked, turning rather irritably on Stephen Blackpool. \u2018I ha\u2019 coom to ask yo, sir, how I am to be ridded o\u2019 this woman.\u2019 Stephen infused a yet deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his attentive face. Mrs. Sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation, as having received a moral shock. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 said Bounderby, getting up to lean his back against the chimney-piece.", " * * * * * Here was Louisa on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in days of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler face. How much of the future might arise before _her_ vision? Broadsides in the streets, signed with her father\u2019s name, exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool, weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own son, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not bring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the Present. So, Stephen Blackpool\u2019s tombstone, with her father\u2019s record of his death, was almost of the Present, for she knew it was to be. These things she could plainly see. But, how much of the Future? A working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once again appearing at the ringing of the Factory bell, and passing to and fro at the set hours, among the Coketown Hands; a woman of pensive beauty, always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and even cheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have compassion on a degraded, drunken wretch of her own sex, who was sometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her, and crying to her; a woman working, ever working, but content to do it, and preferring to do it as her natural lot, until she should be too old to labour any more?"], "What is the term used for the lowest menial laborers in Coketown?": [" The disparity I have mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and (virtually) all but disappears.\u2019 \u2018What do you recommend, father,\u2019 asked Louisa, her reserved composure not in the least affected by these gratifying results, \u2018that I should substitute for the term I used just now? For the misplaced expression?\u2019 \u2018Louisa,\u2019 returned her father, \u2018it appears to me that nothing can be plainer. Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him? Yes, he does. The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him? I think nothing can be plainer than that?\u2019 \u2018Shall I marry him?\u2019 repeated Louisa, with great deliberation. \u2018Precisely. And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear Louisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that belong to many young women.\u2019 \u2018No, father,\u2019 she returned, \u2018I do not.\u2019 \u2018I now leave you to judge for yourself,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind.", " And here she was now, in her elderly days, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby\u2019s tea as he took his breakfast. If Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess whom he took about as a feature in his state-processions, he could not have made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did. Just as it belonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction, so it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s. In the measure that he would not allow his own youth to have been attended by a single favourable circumstance, he brightened Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s juvenile career with every possible advantage, and showered waggon-loads of early roses all over that lady\u2019s path. \u2018And yet, sir,\u2019 he would say, \u2018how does it turn out after all? Why here she is at a hundred a year (I give her a hundred, which she is pleased to term handsome), keeping the house of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown!\u2019 Nay, he made this foil of his so very widely known, that third parties took it up, and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness.", " Father\u2019s a;\u2019 Sissy whispered the awful word, \u2018a clown.\u2019 \u2018To make the people laugh?\u2019 said Louisa, with a nod of intelligence. \u2018Yes. But they wouldn\u2019t laugh sometimes, and then father cried. Lately, they very often wouldn\u2019t laugh, and he used to come home despairing. Father\u2019s not like most. Those who didn\u2019t know him as well as I do, and didn\u2019t love him as dearly as I do, might believe he was not quite right. Sometimes they played tricks upon him; but they never knew how he felt them, and shrunk up, when he was alone with me. He was far, far timider than they thought!\u2019 \u2018And you were his comfort through everything?\u2019 She nodded, with the tears rolling down her face. \u2018I hope so, and father said I was. It was because he grew so scared and trembling, and because he felt himself to be a poor, weak, ignorant, helpless man (those used to be his words), that he wanted me so much to know a great deal, and be different from him.", " I used to read to him to cheer his courage, and he was very fond of that. They were wrong books\u2014I am never to speak of them here\u2014but we didn\u2019t know there was any harm in them.\u2019 \u2018And he liked them?\u2019 said Louisa, with a searching gaze on Sissy all this time. \u2018O very much! They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm. And often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or would have her head cut off before it was finished.\u2019 \u2018And your father was always kind? To the last?\u2019 asked Louisa contravening the great principle, and wondering very much. \u2018Always, always!\u2019 returned Sissy, clasping her hands. \u2018Kinder and kinder than I can tell. He was angry only one night, and that was not to me, but Merrylegs. Merrylegs;\u2019 she whispered the awful fact; \u2018is his performing dog.\u2019 \u2018Why was he angry with the dog?\u2019 Louisa demanded."], "According to Bounderby, who are the only people who can receive divorces?": [" \u2018But I have known you people before to-day, you\u2019ll observe, and I know you never die for want of talking. Now, I recommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as doing. You have undertaken to do something; all I remark upon that at present is, do it!\u2019 \u2018I have written to Stephen by the post that went out this afternoon, as I have written to him once before sin\u2019 he went away,\u2019 said Rachael; \u2018and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.\u2019 \u2018Then, I\u2019ll tell you something. You are not aware perhaps,\u2019 retorted Mr. Bounderby, \u2018that you yourself have been looked after now and then, not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business, on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep. The post-office hasn\u2019t been forgotten either. What I\u2019ll tell you is, that no letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it. Therefore, what has become of yours, I leave you to guess.", " So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by business which required his presence elsewhere, for three or four days. It was on a Friday that he intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank, adding: \u2018But you\u2019ll go down to-morrow, ma\u2019am, all the same. You\u2019ll go down just as if I was there. It will make no difference to you.\u2019 \u2018Pray, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, \u2018let me beg you not to say that. Your absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as I think you very well know.\u2019 \u2018Well, ma\u2019am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, not displeased. \u2018Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 retorted Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018your will is to me a law, sir; otherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.", " \u2018I have already said, I fear Louisa has not been understood. Is it asking too much, Bounderby, that you, so far her elder, should aid in trying to set her right? You have accepted a great charge of her; for better for worse, for\u2014\u2019 Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his own words to Stephen Blackpool, but he cut the quotation short with an angry start. \u2018Come!\u2019 said he, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be told about that. I know what I took her for, as well as you do. Never you mind what I took her for; that\u2019s my look out.\u2019 \u2018I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa.\u2019 \u2018I think differently,\u2019 blustered Bounderby. \u2018I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions.", " If the same annual compliment would be acceptable there, why, I see nothing to part us, unless you do.\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018The proposal is like yourself, and if the position I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale\u2014\u2019 \u2018Why, of course it is,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018If it was not, ma\u2019am, you don\u2019t suppose that I should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in. Not that _I_ care for such society, you know! But _you_ do.\u2019 \u2018Mr. Bounderby, you are very considerate.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll have your own private apartments, and you\u2019ll have your coals and your candles, and all the rest of it, and you\u2019ll have your maid to attend upon you, and you\u2019ll have your light porter to protect you, and you\u2019ll be what I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable,\u2019 said Bounderby. \u2018Sir,\u2019 rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018say no more. In yielding up my trust here, I shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence:\u2019 she might have said the sweetbread, for that delicate article in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper: \u2018and I would rather receive it from your hand, than from any other."], "The strange old woman outside Bounderby's house tells Stephen that she visits there once every ___.": [" \u2018Pray, sir,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018didn\u2019t I see you come out of that gentleman\u2019s house?\u2019 pointing back to Mr. Bounderby\u2019s. \u2018I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?\u2019 \u2018Yes, missus,\u2019 returned Stephen, \u2018it were me.\u2019 \u2018Have you\u2014you\u2019ll excuse an old woman\u2019s curiosity\u2014have you seen the gentleman?\u2019 \u2018Yes, missus.\u2019 \u2018And how did he look, sir? Was he portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?\u2019 As she straightened her own figure, and held up her head in adapting her action to her words, the idea crossed Stephen that he had seen this old woman before, and had not quite liked her. \u2018O yes,\u2019 he returned, observing her more attentively, \u2018he were all that.\u2019 \u2018And healthy,\u2019 said the old woman, \u2018as the fresh wind?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 returned Stephen. \u2018He were ett\u2019n and drinking\u2014as large and as loud as a Hummobee.\u2019 \u2018Thank you!\u2019 said the old woman, with infinite content. \u2018Thank you!\u2019 He certainly never had seen this old woman before.", " There!\u2019 said the old woman to Stephen, \u2018you can make all the rest out for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!\u2019 Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike this old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly could be. With a gentleness that was as natural to him as he knew it to be to Rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in her old age. \u2018Well, missus,\u2019 said he, \u2018I ha seen the lady, and she were young and hansom. Wi\u2019 fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha never seen the like on.\u2019 \u2018Young and handsome. Yes!\u2019 cried the old woman, quite delighted. \u2018As bonny as a rose! And what a happy wife!\u2019 \u2018Aye, missus, I suppose she be,\u2019 said Stephen. But with a doubtful glance at Rachael. \u2018Suppose she be? She must be. She\u2019s your master\u2019s wife,\u2019 returned the old woman. Stephen nodded assent. \u2018Though as to master,\u2019 said he, glancing again at Rachael, \u2018not master onny more.", " CHAPTER VI FADING AWAY IT was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby\u2019s house. The shadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him when he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street. Nothing was further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had encountered on his previous visit to the same house, when he heard a step behind him that he knew, and turning, saw her in Rachael\u2019s company. He saw Rachael first, as he had heard her only. \u2018Ah, Rachael, my dear! Missus, thou wi\u2019 her!\u2019 \u2018Well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason I must say,\u2019 the old woman returned. \u2018Here I am again, you see.\u2019 \u2018But how wi\u2019 Rachael?\u2019 said Stephen, falling into their step, walking between them, and looking from the one to the other. \u2018Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with you,\u2019 said the old woman, cheerfully, taking the reply upon herself.", " the old woman said, quickening hers, too, quite easily. Yes, time was nearly out. On his telling her where he worked, the old woman became a more singular old woman than before. \u2018An\u2019t you happy?\u2019 she asked him. \u2018Why\u2014there\u2019s awmost nobbody but has their troubles, missus.\u2019 He answered evasively, because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he would be very happy indeed, and he had not the heart to disappoint her. He knew that there was trouble enough in the world; and if the old woman had lived so long, and could count upon his having so little, why so much the better for her, and none the worse for him. \u2018Ay, ay! You have your troubles at home, you mean?\u2019 she said. \u2018Times. Just now and then,\u2019 he answered, slightly. \u2018But, working under such a gentleman, they don\u2019t follow you to the Factory?\u2019 No, no; they didn\u2019t follow him there, said Stephen. All correct there. Everything accordant there."], "When Stephen sees his wife about to take a lethal dose of medicine what does he do?": [" for that borough. And when they were united in holy matrimony, they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge aforesaid. There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms, whether native or foreign, and all about it. The bridesmaids, down to little Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of the company. After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness, I suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and know what I am, and what my extraction was, you won\u2019t expect a speech from a man who, when he sees a Post, says \u201cthat\u2019s a Post,\u201d and when he sees a Pump, says \u201cthat\u2019s a Pump,\u201d and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick.", " There!\u2019 said the old woman to Stephen, \u2018you can make all the rest out for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!\u2019 Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike this old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly could be.

Mr. Bounderby wants to speak to you. You know his house, don\u2019t you?\u2019 Stephen said \u2018Yes,\u2019 again. \u2018Then go straight up there, will you?\u2019 said Bitzer. \u2018You\u2019re expected, and have only to tell the servant it\u2019s you. I belong to the Bank; so, if you go straight up without me (I was sent to fetch you), you\u2019ll save me a walk.\u2019 Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby. CHAPTER V MEN AND MASTERS \u2018WELL, Stephen,\u2019 said Bounderby, in his windy manner, \u2018what\u2019s this I hear? What have these pests of the earth been doing to _you_? Come in, and speak up.\u2019 It was into the drawing-room that he was thus bidden. A tea-table was set out; and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s young wife, and her brother, and a great gentleman from London, were present.", " Pray, pray!\u2019 She trembled, and was excessively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to reassure her; and not seeming to know what she was about. \u2018But hearken, missus, hearken,\u2019 said Stephen, astonished. \u2018\u2019Tisn\u2019t Mr. Bounderby; \u2019tis his wife. Yo\u2019r not fearfo\u2019 o\u2019 her. Yo was hey-go-mad about her, but an hour sin.\u2019 \u2018But are you sure it\u2019s the lady, and not the gentleman?\u2019 she asked, still trembling. \u2018Certain sure!\u2019 \u2018Well then, pray don\u2019t speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,\u2019 said the old woman. \u2018Let me be quite to myself in this corner.\u2019 Stephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explanation, which she was quite unable to give him; took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few moments returned, lighting Louisa into the room. She was followed by the whelp. Rachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand, when Stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle on the table."], "What position does Mr. Gradgrind take?": [" So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, \u2018You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,\u2019 Mr. Bounderby replied, \u2018If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma\u2019am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I\u2019ll trouble _you_ to take charge of the teapot.\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her old position at table. This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental. She was so humble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she rose, protesting she never could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often as she had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby\u2019s breakfast, before Mrs. Gradgrind\u2014she begged pardon, she meant to say Miss Bounderby\u2014she hoped to be excused, but she really could not get it right yet, though she trusted to become familiar with it by and by\u2014had assumed her present position.", " Mr. Bounderby has made his proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.\u2019 Silence between them. The deadly statistical clock very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy. \u2018Father,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question. \u2018Well, my child,\u2019 he returned, \u2018I\u2014really\u2014cannot take upon myself to say.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, \u2018do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?\u2019 \u2018My dear Louisa, no. No. I ask nothing.\u2019 \u2018Father,\u2019 she still pursued, \u2018does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him?\u2019 \u2018Really, my dear,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018it is difficult to answer your question\u2014\u2019 \u2018Difficult to answer it, Yes or No, father? \u2018Certainly, my dear.

What with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as cool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts; Tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his end of the sofa, and more than ever disposed to admire his new friend at the other end. Tom blew his smoke aside, after he had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his friend. \u2018He don\u2019t seem to care about his dress,\u2019 thought Tom, \u2018and yet how capitally he does it. What an easy swell he is!\u2019 Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom\u2019s eye, remarked that he drank nothing, and filled his glass with his own negligent hand. \u2018Thank\u2019ee,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Thank\u2019ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.\u2019 Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his glass knowingly, at his entertainer.", " But he preserved his easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little surface-island. \u2018My dear Tom,\u2019 said Harthouse, \u2018let me try to be your banker.\u2019 \u2018For God\u2019s sake,\u2019 replied Tom, suddenly, \u2018don\u2019t talk about bankers!\u2019 And very white he looked, in contrast with the roses. Very white. Mr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accustomed to the best society, was not to be surprised\u2014he could as soon have been affected\u2014but he raised his eyelids a little more, as if they were lifted by a feeble touch of wonder. Albeit it was as much against the precepts of his school to wonder, as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind College. \u2018What is the present need, Tom? Three figures? Out with them. Say what they are.\u2019 \u2018Mr. Harthouse,\u2019 returned Tom, now actually crying; and his tears were better than his injuries, however pitiful a figure he made: \u2018it\u2019s too late; the money is of no use to me at present.", " I made an exception of you at first. I don\u2019t know what this\u2014jolly old\u2014Jaundiced Jail,\u2019 Tom had paused to find a sufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof, and seemed to relieve his mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of this one, \u2018would be without you.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, Tom? Do you really and truly say so?\u2019 \u2018Why, of course I do. What\u2019s the use of talking about it!\u2019 returned Tom, chafing his face on his coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his flesh, and have it in unison with his spirit. \u2018Because, Tom,\u2019 said his sister, after silently watching the sparks awhile, \u2018as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can\u2019t reconcile you to home better than I am able to do. I don\u2019t know what other girls know. I can\u2019t play to you, or sing to you. I can\u2019t talk to you so as to lighten your mind, for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when you are tired.\u2019 \u2018Well, no more do I. I am as bad as you in that respect; and I am a Mule too, which you\u2019re not.", " Mr. Harthouse took him persuasively by the coat. \u2018But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got it\u2014\u2019 \u2018Not got it, Mr. Harthouse? I don\u2019t say she has got it. I may have wanted more than she was likely to have got. But then she ought to get it. She could get it. It\u2019s of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now, after what I have told you already; you know she didn\u2019t marry old Bounderby for her own sake, or for his sake, but for my sake. Then why doesn\u2019t she get what I want, out of him, for my sake? She is not obliged to say what she is going to do with it; she is sharp enough; she could manage to coax it out of him, if she chose. Then why doesn\u2019t she choose, when I tell her of what consequence it is? But no. There she sits in his company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily. I don\u2019t know what you may call this, but I call it unnatural conduct.\u2019 There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on the other side, into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior, as the injured men of Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic."], "Who attempts to unionize the factory workers?": [" The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round the placards, devouring them with eager eyes.

Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling wheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets, there were still as many readers as before. Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his audience too that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had brought it in his pocket.", " the old woman said, quickening hers, too, quite easily. Yes, time was nearly out.

He knew that there was trouble enough in the world; and if the old woman had lived so long, and could count upon his having so little, why so much the better for her, and none the worse for him. \u2018Ay, ay!

She sat at the window, when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she sat there, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from it, when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward, upward, up to the house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of the factory chimneys, up to the sky. Without a candle in the room, Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window, with her hands before her, not thinking much of the sounds of evening; the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street cries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by, the shutting-up of shop-shutters.", " (He did not go so far as to say, for her pleasure, that there was a sort of Divine Right there; but, I have heard claims almost as magnificent of late years.) They were now in the black by-road near the place, and the Hands were crowding in. The bell was ringing, and the Serpent was a Serpent of many coils, and the Elephant was getting ready. The strange old woman was delighted with the very bell. It was the beautifullest bell she had ever heard, she said, and sounded grand! She asked him, when he stopped good-naturedly to shake hands with her before going in, how long he had worked there? \u2018A dozen year,\u2019 he told her. \u2018I must kiss the hand,\u2019 said she, \u2018that has worked in this fine factory for a dozen year!\u2019 And she lifted it, though he would have prevented her, and put it to her lips.

Wounded too, and bruised.\u2019 He slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his head before her. \u2018I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for that she worked with me when we were girls both, and for that you courted her and married her when I was her friend\u2014\u2019 He laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan. \u2018And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure and certain that \u2019tis far too merciful to let her die, or even so much as suffer, for want of aid.

I never thought those fellows could be right in anything; but I tell you what!

The objects he had lately pursued, turned worthless beside her; such success as was almost in his grasp, he flung away from him like the dirt it was, compared with her. Its pursuit, nevertheless, if it kept him near her, or its renunciation if it took him from her, or flight if she shared it, or secrecy if she commanded it, or any fate, or every fate, all was alike to him, so that she was true to him,\u2014the man who had seen how cast away she was, whom she had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of which he had thought himself incapable, whom she had received into her confidence, who was devoted to her and adored her.", " Their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind. He was an affectionate father, after his manner; but he would probably have described himself (if he had been put, like Sissy Jupe, upon a definition) as \u2018an eminently practical\u2019 father. He had a particular pride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a special application to him. Whatsoever the public meeting held in Coketown, and whatsoever the subject of such meeting, some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his eminently practical friend Gradgrind. This always pleased the eminently practical friend. He knew it to be his due, but his due was acceptable. He had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which was neither town nor country, and yet was either spoiled, when his ears were invaded by the sound of music.

The evil spirit of his life had flitted away again, months ago, and he had heard no more of her since. The only evidence of her last return now, were the scantier moveables in his room, and the grayer hair upon his head.

He was neither courtly, nor handsome, nor picturesque, in any respect; and yet his manner of accepting it, and of expressing his thanks without more words, had a grace in it that Lord Chesterfield could not have taught his son in a century.

Mr. Bounderby looked more astonished than hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his dining-room. \u2018Why, what\u2019s the matter now!\u2019 said he. \u2018Mrs. Sparsit, ma\u2019am?\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 explained that worthy woman, \u2018I trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find. Stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind, sir, and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside, as have been afforded by the young woman, Rachael, fortunately now present to identify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring that person with me\u2014I need not say most unwillingly on her part.", " And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be.

Very quaint!\u2019 said his friend. \u2018Though you don\u2019t mean it.\u2019 \u2018But I _do_ mean it,\u2019 cried Tom. \u2018Upon my honour! Why, you won\u2019t tell me, Mr. Harthouse, that you really suppose my sister Loo does care for old Bounderby.\u2019 \u2018My dear fellow,\u2019 returned the other, \u2018what am I bound to suppose, when I find two married people living in harmony and happiness?\u2019 Tom had by this time got both his legs on the sofa. If his second leg had not been already there when he was called a dear fellow, he would have put it up at that great stage of the conversation. Feeling it necessary to do something then, he stretched himself out at greater length, and, reclining with the back of his head on the end of the sofa, and smoking with an infinite assumption of negligence, turned his common face, and not too sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him so carelessly yet so potently.", " For I asked him to go there with me. The visit did not originate with him.\u2019 \u2018He had some conversation with the poor man. Did he take him aside?\u2019 \u2018He took him out of the room. I asked him afterwards, why he had done so, and he made a plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and when I remember the circumstances by its light, I am afraid I can imagine too truly what passed between them.\u2019 \u2018Let me know,\u2019 said her father, \u2018if your thoughts present your guilty brother in the same dark view as mine.\u2019 \u2018I fear, father,\u2019 hesitated Louisa, \u2018that he must have made some representation to Stephen Blackpool\u2014perhaps in my name, perhaps in his own\u2014which induced him to do in good faith and honesty, what he had never done before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights before he left the town.\u2019 \u2018Too plain!\u2019 returned the father. \u2018Too plain!\u2019 He shaded his face, and remained silent for some moments."], "How much money is stolen from the bank?": [" \u2018Suspicious,\u2019 said James Harthouse, \u2018certainly.\u2019 \u2018I think so, sir,\u2019 said Bounderby, with a defiant nod. \u2018I think so. But there are more of \u2019em in it. There\u2019s an old woman. One never hears of these things till the mischief\u2019s done; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen; there\u2019s an old woman turns up now. An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick, every now and then. _She_ watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him, she steals away with him and holds a council with him\u2014I suppose, to make her report on going off duty, and be damned to her.\u2019 There was such a person in the room that night, and she shrunk from observation, thought Louisa. \u2018This is not all of \u2019em, even as we already know \u2019em,\u2019 said Bounderby, with many nods of hidden meaning. \u2018But I have said enough for the present.", " I would never complain of anything, and what I have done I do not in the least regret.\u2019 \u2018So spirited, too!\u2019 thought James Harthouse. \u2018When I married, I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt. Heavily for him, I mean. Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets. They were no sacrifice. I sold them very willingly. I attached no value to them. They, were quite worthless to me.\u2019 Either she saw in his face that he knew, or she only feared in her conscience that he knew, that she spoke of some of her husband\u2019s gifts. She stopped, and reddened again. If he had not known it before, he would have known it then, though he had been a much duller man than he was. \u2018Since then, I have given my brother, at various times, what money I could spare: in short, what money I have had. Confiding in you at all, on the faith of the interest you profess for him, I will not do so by halves.", " CHAPTER XIV THE GREAT MANUFACTURER TIME went on in Coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought up, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made. But, less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and made the only stand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity. \u2018Louisa is becoming,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018almost a young woman.\u2019 Time, with his innumerable horse-power, worked away, not minding what anybody said, and presently turned out young Thomas a foot taller than when his father had last taken particular notice of him. \u2018Thomas is becoming,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018almost a young man.\u2019 Time passed Thomas on in the mill, while his father was thinking about it, and there he stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar. \u2018Really,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018the period has arrived when Thomas ought to go to Bounderby.\u2019 Time, sticking to him, passed him on into Bounderby\u2019s Bank, made him an inmate of Bounderby\u2019s house, necessitated the purchase of his first razor, and exercised him diligently in his calculations relative to number one.", " \u2018You are the picture of independence. Mr. Harthouse, I am in a horrible mess. You have no idea what a state I have got myself into\u2014what a state my sister might have got me out of, if she would only have done it.\u2019 He took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them away from his teeth with a hand that trembled like an infirm old man\u2019s. After one exceedingly observant look at him, his companion relapsed into his lightest air. \u2018Tom, you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of your sister. You have had money of her, you dog, you know you have.\u2019 \u2018Well, Mr. Harthouse, I know I have. How else was I to get it? Here\u2019s old Bounderby always boasting that at my age he lived upon twopence a month, or something of that sort. Here\u2019s my father drawing what he calls a line, and tying me down to it from a baby, neck and heels. Here\u2019s my mother who never has anything of her own, except her complaints.

He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth.", " \u2018Now, Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, bursting into his father-in-law\u2019s room late at night; \u2018here\u2019s a lady here\u2014Mrs. Sparsit\u2014you know Mrs. Sparsit\u2014who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.\u2019 \u2018You have missed my letter!\u2019 exclaimed Mr. Gradgrind, surprised by the apparition. \u2018Missed your letter, sir!\u2019 bawled Bounderby. \u2018The present time is no time for letters. No man shall talk to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown about letters, with his mind in the state it\u2019s in now.\u2019 \u2018Bounderby,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, \u2018I speak of a very special letter I have written to you, in reference to Louisa.\u2019 \u2018Tom Gradgrind,\u2019 replied Bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several times with great vehemence on the table, \u2018I speak of a very special messenger that has come to me, in reference to Louisa. Mrs. Sparsit, ma\u2019am, stand forward!\u2019 That unfortunate lady hereupon essaying to offer testimony, without any voice and with painful gestures expressive of an inflamed throat, became so aggravating and underwent so many facial contortions, that Mr. Bounderby, unable to bear it, seized her by the arm and shook her.", " And, Thomas, it is really shameful, with my poor head continually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you have been, and whose education has cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his sister to wonder, when he knows his father has expressly said that she is not to do it.\u2019 Louisa denied Tom\u2019s participation in the offence; but her mother stopped her with the conclusive answer, \u2018Louisa, don\u2019t tell me, in my state of health; for unless you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it.\u2019 \u2018I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire, and whitening and dying. It made me think, after all, how short my life would be, and how little I could hope to do in it.\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said Mrs. Gradgrind, rendered almost energetic. \u2018Nonsense! Don\u2019t stand there and tell me such stuff, Louisa, to my face, when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father\u2019s ears I should never hear the last of it.", " Where is he? Who is he?\u2019 His hair had latterly began to change its colour. As he leaned upon his hand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side. Her eyes by accident met Sissy\u2019s at the moment. Sissy flushed and started, and Louisa put her finger on her lip. Next night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that Stephen was not come, she told it in a whisper. Next night again, when she came home with the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke in the same low frightened tone. From the moment of that interchange of looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it. The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and Stephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of. On the fourth day, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to have miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her letter from him with his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road, sixty miles away."], "Which of the Gradgrind children was raised primarily by Sissy?": [" Her mother had taken it rather as a disturbance than otherwise, to be visited, as she reclined upon her sofa; young people, Louisa felt herself all unfit for; Sissy she had never softened to again, since the night when the stroller\u2019s child had raised her eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby\u2019s intended wife. She had no inducements to go back, and had rarely gone. Neither, as she approached her old home now, did any of the best influences of old home descend upon her. The dreams of childhood\u2014its airy fables; its graceful, beautiful, humane, impossible adornments of the world beyond: so good to be believed in once, so good to be remembered when outgrown, for then the least among them rises to the stature of a great Charity in the heart, suffering little children to come into the midst of it, and to keep with their pure hands a garden in the stony ways of this world, wherein it were better for all the children of Adam that they should oftener sun themselves, simple and trustful, and not worldly-wise\u2014what had she to do with these?", " I shall never learn,\u2019 said Sissy. \u2018And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he wished me to, I am afraid I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her, until it was raised again to glance at her face. Then she asked: \u2018Did your father know so much himself, that he wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?\u2019 Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, \u2018No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.\u2019 \u2018No, Miss Louisa,\u2019 answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her head; \u2018father knows very little indeed. It\u2019s as much as he can do to write; and it\u2019s more than people in general can do to read his writing.

W. B. Childers answered. \u2018Nine oils, Merrylegs, missing tips, garters, banners, and Ponging, eh!\u2019 ejaculated Bounderby, with his laugh of laughs. \u2018Queer sort of company, too, for a man who has raised himself!\u2019 \u2018Lower yourself, then,\u2019 retorted Cupid. \u2018Oh Lord! if you\u2019ve raised yourself so high as all that comes to, let yourself down a bit.\u2019 \u2018This is a very obtrusive lad!\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, turning, and knitting his brows on him. \u2018We\u2019d have had a young gentleman to meet you, if we had known you were coming,\u2019 retorted Master Kidderminster, nothing abashed. \u2018It\u2019s a pity you don\u2019t have a bespeak, being so particular.

Get out, get out!\u2019 said Mr. Childers, thrusting his young friend from the room, rather in the prairie manner.", " Indeed, as he eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before mentioned, he seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one discharge. He seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away. \u2018Girl number twenty,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his square forefinger, \u2018I don\u2019t know that girl. Who is that girl?\u2019 \u2018Sissy Jupe, sir,\u2019 explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and curtseying. \u2018Sissy is not a name,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Don\u2019t call yourself Sissy. Call yourself Cecilia.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s father as calls me Sissy, sir,\u2019 returned the young girl in a trembling voice, and with another curtsey. \u2018Then he has no business to do it,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018Tell him he mustn\u2019t.

Mrs. Sparsit, from her place at the backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the shadows without. \u2018What\u2019s the matter, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby; \u2018you don\u2019t see a Fire, do you?\u2019 \u2018Oh dear no, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I was thinking of the dew.\u2019 \u2018What have you got to do with the dew, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018It\u2019s not myself, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I am fearful of Miss Gradgrind\u2019s taking cold.\u2019 \u2018She never takes cold,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Really, sir?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. And was affected with a cough in her throat. When the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a glass of water. \u2018Oh, sir?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Not your sherry warm, with lemon-peel and nutmeg?\u2019 \u2018Why, I have got out of the habit of taking it now, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby."], "Where does Louisa go after Mr. Harthouse asks her to become his lover?": [" \u2018You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018and therefore, you needn\u2019t be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby. She never had a lover, and the governor proposed old Bounderby, and she took him.\u2019 \u2018Very dutiful in your interesting sister,\u2019 said Mr. James Harthouse. \u2018Yes, but she wouldn\u2019t have been as dutiful, and it would not have come off as easily,\u2019 returned the whelp, \u2018if it hadn\u2019t been for me.\u2019 The tempter merely lifted his eyebrows; but the whelp was obliged to go on. \u2018_I_ persuaded her,\u2019 he said, with an edifying air of superiority. \u2018I was stuck into old Bounderby\u2019s bank (where I never wanted to be), and I knew I should get into scrapes there, if she put old Bounderby\u2019s pipe out; so I told her my wishes, and she came into them. She would do anything for me. It was very game of her, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018It was charming, Tom!\u2019 \u2018Not that it was altogether so important to her as it was to me,\u2019 continued Tom coolly, \u2018because my liberty and comfort, and perhaps my getting on, depended on it; and she had no other lover, and staying at home was like staying in jail\u2014especially when I was gone.", " Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his hand; superscribed, \u2018Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown.

Therefore, if you will allow me\u2014or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man\u2014I\u2019ll tell you something about it before we go any further.\u2019 Mr. Harthouse would be charmed.", " I should have had it before to be of use to me.

And, my good fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Tom, shaking his head dismally, and chewing rosebuds. \u2018I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Harthouse.\u2019 \u2018Now, you see, Tom,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing over a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland: \u2018every man is selfish in everything he does, and I am exactly like the rest of my fellow-creatures.", " Still,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018I need not point out to you, Louisa, that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate.\u2019 \u2018While it lasts, I would wish to do the little I can, and the little I am fit for.

What matter, my dear?\u2019 \u2018Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 she went on in a steady, straight way, without regarding this, \u2018asks me to marry him. The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him? That is so, father, is it not? You have told me so, father. Have you not?\u2019 \u2018Certainly, my dear.\u2019 \u2018Let it be so. Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus, I am satisfied to accept his proposal. Tell him, father, as soon as you please, that this was my answer. Repeat it, word for word, if you can, because I should wish him to know what I said.\u2019 \u2018It is quite right, my dear,\u2019 retorted her father approvingly, \u2018to be exact."], "Mr. Gradgrind regrets he cannot help his daughter in her crisis because he never learned, \u201cthe wisdom of ___.\u201d": [" To speak unreservedly to you, I do. I am far from feeling convinced now, however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday, that I am fit for the trust you repose in me; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me; that I have the right instinct\u2014supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature\u2014how to help you, and to set you right, my child.\u2019 She had turned upon her pillow, and lay with her face upon her arm, so that he could not see it. All her wildness and passion had subsided; but, though softened, she was not in tears. Her father was changed in nothing so much as in the respect that he would have been glad to see her in tears. \u2018Some persons hold,\u2019 he pursued, still hesitating, \u2018that there is a wisdom of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart. I have not supposed so; but, as I have said, I mistrust myself now. I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient.", " She rising as he did so, they stood close together: she, with a hand upon his shoulder, looking fixedly in his face. \u2018With a hunger and thirst upon me, father, which have never been for a moment appeased; with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules, and figures, and definitions were not quite absolute; I have grown up, battling every inch of my way.\u2019 \u2018I never knew you were unhappy, my child.\u2019 \u2018Father, I always knew it. In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon. What I have learned has left me doubting, misbelieving, despising, regretting, what I have not learned; and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by, and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest.\u2019 \u2018And you so young, Louisa!\u2019 he said with pity. \u2018And I so young. In this condition, father\u2014for I show you now, without fear or favour, the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it\u2014you proposed my husband to me.", " If you want a speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it.

However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused. So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don\u2019t, I can\u2019t help it. I _do_ feel independent. Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind\u2019s daughter. I am very glad to be so. It has long been my wish to be so. I have watched her bringing-up, and I believe she is worthy of me. At the same time\u2014not to deceive you\u2014I believe I am worthy of her. So, I thank you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present company, is this: I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have found.", " It was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog barking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with his one practicable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions.

Lo, Louisa coming out of the house! Hastily cloaked and muffled, and stealing away. She elopes! She falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf. Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she struck into a side-path parallel with the ride. Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness. When she stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped. When she went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on. She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad. A train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she understood Coketown to be her first place of destination.", " \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward."], "How does Bounderby react to Mr. Gradgrind\u2019s request that Louisa be allowed to recover at Stone Lodge for a time?": [" He had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware trade before he built Stone Lodge, and was now looking about for a suitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in Parliament. Stone Lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great town\u2014called Coketown in the present faithful guide-book. A very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge was. Not the least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in the landscape. A great square house, with a heavy portico darkening the principal windows, as its master\u2019s heavy brows overshadowed his eyes. A calculated, cast up, balanced, and proved house. Six windows on this side of the door, six on that side; a total of twelve in this wing, a total of twelve in the other wing; four-and-twenty carried over to the back wings. A lawn and garden and an infant avenue, all ruled straight like a botanical account-book.", " A man who was the Bully of humility. A year or two younger than his eminently practical friend, Mr. Bounderby looked older; his seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or eight added to it again, without surprising anybody. He had not much hair. One might have fancied he had talked it off; and that what was left, all standing up in disorder, was in that condition from being constantly blown about by his windy boastfulness. In the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge, standing on the hearthrug, warming himself before the fire, Mr. Bounderby delivered some observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his birthday. He stood before the fire, partly because it was a cool spring afternoon, though the sun shone; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar; partly because he thus took up a commanding position, from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind.", " \u2018In this degraded position! I am amazed.\u2019 \u2018I was tired, father. I have been tired a long time,\u2019 said Louisa. \u2018Tired?

I will hear no more.\u2019 He did not speak again until they had walked some half-a-mile in silence, when he gravely broke out with: \u2018What would your best friends say, Louisa? Do you attach no value to their good opinion? What would Mr. Bounderby say?\u2019 At the mention of this name, his daughter stole a look at him, remarkable for its intense and searching character. He saw nothing of it, for before he looked at her, she had again cast down her eyes! \u2018What,\u2019 he repeated presently, \u2018would Mr. Bounderby say?\u2019 All the way to Stone Lodge, as with grave indignation he led the two delinquents home, he repeated at intervals \u2018What would Mr. Bounderby say?\u2019\u2014as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.", " It was only (she observed) because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and Mr. Bounderby\u2019s time was so very precious, and she knew it of old to be so essential that he should breakfast to the moment, that she had taken the liberty of complying with his request; long as his will had been a law to her. \u2018There! Stop where you are, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018stop where you are!

Why should it be of any importance to me?\u2019 \u2018Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight."], "When Louisa leaves, what does Bounderby focus his rage on?": [" Very near the bottom now. Upon the brink of the abyss. An overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its drooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her carriage, pass down the wooden steps of the little station into a stony road, cross it into a green lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches. One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily crossing and recrossing her, and the reek of her own tread in the thick dust that felt like velvet, were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she very softly closed a gate. She went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and went round it, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows. Most of them were open, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights yet, and all was silent. She tried the garden with no better effect. She thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long grass and briers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the creeping things that be.", " Louisa languidly leaned upon the window looking out, without looking at anything, while young Thomas stood sniffing revengefully at the fire. Adam Smith and Malthus, two younger Gradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody; and little Jane, after manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay on her face with slate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions. \u2018It\u2019s all right now, Louisa: it\u2019s all right, young Thomas,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby; \u2018you won\u2019t do so any more.

Well, Louisa, that\u2019s worth a kiss, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 returned Louisa, when she had coldly paused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her cheek towards him, with her face turned away. \u2018Always my pet; ain\u2019t you, Louisa?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Good-bye, Louisa!\u2019 He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red.", " She died when I was born. She was;\u2019 Sissy made the terrible communication nervously; \u2018she was a dancer.\u2019 \u2018Did your father love her?\u2019 Louisa asked these questions with a strong, wild, wandering interest peculiar to her; an interest gone astray like a banished creature, and hiding in solitary places. \u2018O yes! As dearly as he loves me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried me about with him when I was quite a baby. We have never been asunder from that time.\u2019 \u2018Yet he leaves you now, Sissy?\u2019 \u2018Only for my good. Nobody understands him as I do; nobody knows him as I do. When he left me for my good\u2014he never would have left me for his own\u2014I know he was almost broken-hearted with the trial. He will not be happy for a single minute, till he comes back.\u2019 \u2018Tell me more about him,\u2019 said Louisa, \u2018I will never ask you again. Where did you live?\u2019 \u2018We travelled about the country, and had no fixed place to live in.", " \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby again. \u2018How did she come there?\u2019 \u2018Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now. She specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and\u2014yes, you are right, Bounderby, you are right.\u2019 \u2018Now, stop a bit!\u2019 cried Bounderby, once more. \u2018Louisa saw her when she came?\u2019 \u2018Louisa certainly did see her, for she mentioned the application to me. But Louisa saw her, I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind\u2019s presence.\u2019 \u2018Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018what passed?\u2019 \u2018Oh, my poor health!\u2019 returned Mrs. Gradgrind. \u2018The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!\u2019 \u2018Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby."], "Who visits Rachel every night, waiting for news of Stephen?": [" When they came to the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as she had left it. The men called and listened as she had done, and examined the edge of the chasm, and settled how it had happened, and then sat down to wait until the implements they wanted should come up. Every sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the leaves, every whisper among these men, made Sissy tremble, for she thought it was a cry at the bottom of the pit. But the wind blew idly over it, and no sound arose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, waiting and waiting. After they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the accident began to come up; then the real help of implements began to arrive. In the midst of this, Rachael returned; and with her party there was a surgeon, who brought some wine and medicines. But, the expectation among the people that the man would be found alive was very slight indeed.", " I feel so certain, Rachael, that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him than if I had known him through as many years of trial as you have.\u2019 \u2018And I, my dear,\u2019 said Rachel, with a tremble in her voice, \u2018have known him through them all, to be, according to his quiet ways, so faithful to everything honest and good, that if he was never to be heard of more, and I was to live to be a hundred years old, I could say with my last breath, God knows my heart. I have never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool!\u2019 \u2018We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he will be freed from suspicion, sooner or later.\u2019 \u2018The better I know it to be so believed there, my dear,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018and the kinder I feel it that you come away from there, purposely to comfort me, and keep me company, and be seen wi\u2019 me when I am not yet free from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.", " Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s tea was just set for her on a pert little table, with its tripod of legs in an attitude, which she insinuated after office-hours, into the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that bestrode the middle of the room. The light porter placed the tea-tray on it, knuckling his forehead as a form of homage. \u2018Thank you, Bitzer,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Thank _you_, ma\u2019am,\u2019 returned the light porter. He was a very light porter indeed; as light as in the days when he blinkingly defined a horse, for girl number twenty. \u2018All is shut up, Bitzer?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018All is shut up, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018And what,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her tea, \u2018is the news of the day? Anything?\u2019 \u2018Well, ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t say that I have heard anything particular. Our people are a bad lot, ma\u2019am; but that is no news, unfortunately.\u2019 \u2018What are the restless wretches doing now?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit.", " He never used to go there. It was never in his way. His way was the same as mine, and not near it.\u2019 Sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of him. \u2018I doubt,\u2019 said Rachael, \u2018if he can be here till next day.\u2019 \u2018Then I will come next night too,\u2019 said Sissy. When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his head, and said to his daughter: \u2018Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man. Do you believe him to be implicated?\u2019 \u2018I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty. I do not believe it now.\u2019 \u2018That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing him to be suspected. His appearance and manner; are they so honest?\u2019 \u2018Very honest.\u2019 \u2018And her confidence not to be shaken! I ask myself,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, musing, \u2018does the real culprit know of these accusations?"], "Who does Rachel see Mrs. Sparsit dragging into Bounderby\u2019s house?": [" The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby\u2019s steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an ecstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment, called to them to stop. \u2018It\u2019s a coincidence,\u2019 exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she was released by the coachman. \u2018It\u2019s a Providence! Come out, ma\u2019am!\u2019 then said Mrs. Sparsit, to some one inside, \u2018come out, or we\u2019ll have you dragged out!\u2019 Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended. Whom Mrs. Sparsit incontinently collared. \u2018Leave her alone, everybody!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, with great energy. \u2018Let nobody touch her. She belongs to me. Come in, ma\u2019am!\u2019 then said Mrs. Sparsit, reversing her former word of command. \u2018Come in, ma\u2019am, or we\u2019ll have you dragged in!\u2019 The spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an ancient woman by the throat, and hauling her into a dwelling-house, would have been under any circumstances, sufficient temptation to all true English stragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into that dwelling-house and see the matter out.", " Louisa and Mr. Harthouse strolled out into the garden, where their voices could be heard in the stillness, though not what they said. Mrs. Sparsit, from her place at the backgammon board, was constantly straining her eyes to pierce the shadows without. \u2018What\u2019s the matter, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby; \u2018you don\u2019t see a Fire, do you?\u2019 \u2018Oh dear no, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I was thinking of the dew.\u2019 \u2018What have you got to do with the dew, ma\u2019am?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018It\u2019s not myself, sir,\u2019 returned Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018I am fearful of Miss Gradgrind\u2019s taking cold.\u2019 \u2018She never takes cold,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Really, sir?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. And was affected with a cough in her throat. When the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a glass of water. \u2018Oh, sir?\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Not your sherry warm, with lemon-peel and nutmeg?\u2019 \u2018Why, I have got out of the habit of taking it now, ma\u2019am,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby.", " \u2018You found Miss Gradgrind\u2014I really cannot call her Mrs. Bounderby; it\u2019s very absurd of me\u2014as youthful as I described her?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. \u2018You drew her portrait perfectly,\u2019 said Mr. Harthouse. \u2018Presented her dead image.\u2019 \u2018Very engaging, sir,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her mittens slowly to revolve over one another. \u2018Highly so.\u2019 \u2018It used to be considered,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect. Ay, and indeed here _is_ Mr. Bounderby!\u2019 cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her head a great many times, as if she had been talking and thinking of no one else. \u2018How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.\u2019 Now, these persistent assuagements of his misery, and lightenings of his load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his wife downward.", " \u2018Mr. Thomas,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018these plain viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.\u2019 \u2018Thank\u2019ee, Mrs. Sparsit,\u2019 said the whelp. And gloomily fell to. \u2018How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?\u2019 asked Mrs. Sparsit. \u2018Oh, he\u2019s all right,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Where may he be at present?\u2019 Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative. \u2018He is shooting in Yorkshire,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church, yesterday.\u2019 \u2018The kind of gentleman, now,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, \u2018whom one might wager to be a good shot!\u2019 \u2018Crack,\u2019 said Tom. He had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of late, that he never raised his eyes to any face for three seconds together. Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his looks, if she were so inclined. \u2018Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,\u2019 said Mrs. Sparsit, \u2018as indeed he is of most people."], "What is the name of the mining pit that Stephen falls into?": [" Then the other man came up. In the meantime, under the surgeon\u2019s directions, some men brought a hurdle, on which others made a thick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw, while he himself contrived some bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs. As these were made, they were hung upon an arm of the pitman who had last come up, with instructions how to use them: and as he stood, shown by the light he carried, leaning his powerful loose hand upon one of the poles, and sometimes glancing down the pit, and sometimes glancing round upon the people, he was not the least conspicuous figure in the scene. It was dark now, and torches were kindled. It appeared from the little this man said to those about him, which was quickly repeated all over the circle, that the lost man had fallen upon a mass of crumbled rubbish with which the pit was half choked up, and that his fall had been further broken by some jagged earth at the side.", " Everything was in its place and order as he had always kept it, the little fire was newly trimmed, and the hearth was freshly swept. It appeared to him that he saw all this in Rachael\u2019s face, and looked at nothing besides. While looking at it, it was shut out from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes; but not before he had seen how earnestly she looked at him, and how her own eyes were filled too. She turned again towards the bed, and satisfying herself that all was quiet there, spoke in a low, calm, cheerful voice. \u2018I am glad you have come at last, Stephen. You are very late.\u2019 \u2018I ha\u2019 been walking up an\u2019 down.\u2019 \u2018I thought so. But \u2019tis too bad a night for that. The rain falls very heavy, and the wind has risen.\u2019 The wind? True. It was blowing hard. Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise! To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was blowing!", " Mr. Bounderby was at his lunch. So Stephen had expected. Would his servant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him? Message in return, requiring name of such Hand. Stephen Blackpool. There was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he might come in. Stephen Blackpool in the parlour. Mr. Bounderby (whom he just knew by sight), at lunch on chop and sherry. Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup. It was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s dignity and service, not to lunch. She supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her own stately person she considered lunch a weakness. \u2018Now, Stephen,\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby, \u2018what\u2019s the matter with _you_?\u2019 Stephen made a bow. Not a servile one\u2014these Hands will never do that! Lord bless you, sir, you\u2019ll never catch them at that, if they have been with you twenty years!\u2014and, as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit, tucked his neckerchief ends into his waistcoat.", " He lay upon his back with one arm doubled under him, and according to his own belief had hardly stirred since he fell, except that he had moved his free hand to a side pocket, in which he remembered to have some bread and meat (of which he had swallowed crumbs), and had likewise scooped up a little water in it now and then. He had come straight away from his work, on being written to, and had walked the whole journey; and was on his way to Mr. Bounderby\u2019s country house after dark, when he fell. He was crossing that dangerous country at such a dangerous time, because he was innocent of what was laid to his charge, and couldn\u2019t rest from coming the nearest way to deliver himself up. The Old Hell Shaft, the pitman said, with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the last; for though Stephen could speak now, he believed it would soon be found to have mangled the life out of him. When all was ready, this man, still taking his last hurried charges from his comrades and the surgeon after the windlass had begun to lower him, disappeared into the pit."], "Who does Tom blame for putting him in a situation that forced him to steal from the bank?": [" I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him over to Mr. Bounderby. Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom\u2019s situation. And I wish to have his situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.\u2019 \u2018If this is solely a question of self-interest with you\u2014\u2019 Mr. Gradgrind began. \u2018I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer; \u2018but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest. What you must always appeal to, is a person\u2019s self-interest. It\u2019s your only hold. We are so constituted. I was brought up in that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are aware.\u2019 \u2018What sum of money,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018will you set against your expected promotion?\u2019 \u2018Thank you, sir,\u2019 returned Bitzer, \u2018for hinting at the proposal; but I will not set any sum against it. Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind; and I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed, would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank.\u2019 \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his hands as though he would have said, See how miserable I am!", " But I touch him up with you when he comes it too strong, and so we preserve an understanding. I say! Has father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday, Loo?\u2019 \u2018No, Tom. But he told me to-night that he wished to do so in the morning.\u2019 \u2018Ah! That\u2019s what I mean,\u2019 said Tom. \u2018Do you know where he is to-night?\u2019\u2014with a very deep expression. \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll tell you. He\u2019s with old Bounderby. They are having a regular confab together up at the Bank. Why at the Bank, do you think? Well, I\u2019ll tell you again. To keep Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s ears as far off as possible, I expect.\u2019 With her hand upon her brother\u2019s shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire. Her brother glanced at her face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her waist with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him. \u2018You are very fond of me, an\u2019t you, Loo?\u2019 \u2018Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me.\u2019 \u2018Well, sister of mine,\u2019 said Tom, \u2018when you say that, you are near my thoughts.", " Being then disturbed, they made off; letting themselves out at the main door, and double-locking it again (it was double-locked, and the key under Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s pillow) with a false key, which was picked up in the street near the Bank, about twelve o\u2019clock to-day. No alarm takes place, till this chap, Bitzer, turns out this morning, and begins to open and prepare the offices for business. Then, looking at Tom\u2019s safe, he sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the money gone.\u2019 \u2018Where is Tom, by the by?\u2019 asked Harthouse, glancing round. \u2018He has been helping the police,\u2019 said Bounderby, \u2018and stays behind at the Bank. I wish these fellows had tried to rob me when I was at his time of life. They would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job; I can tell \u2019em that.\u2019 \u2018Is anybody suspected?\u2019 \u2018Suspected? I should think there was somebody suspected. Egod!\u2019 said Bounderby, relinquishing Mrs. Sparsit\u2019s arm to wipe his heated head.", " \u2018I\u2019m sooary I ha spok\u2019n on \u2019t,\u2019 said Stephen, \u2018I ought t\u2019 hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place. I\u2014I blame myseln.\u2019 While he excused himself, the old lady\u2019s cup rattled more and more. \u2018I had a son,\u2019 she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; \u2018and he did well, wonderfully well. But he is not to be spoken of if you please. He is\u2014\u2019 Putting down her cup, she moved her hands as if she would have added, by her action, \u2018dead!\u2019 Then she said aloud, \u2018I have lost him.\u2019 Stephen had not yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain, when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to the door, whispered in his ear. Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for she caught a word as it was uttered. \u2018Bounderby!\u2019 she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. \u2018Oh hide me! Don\u2019t let me be seen for the world. Don\u2019t let him come up till I\u2019ve got away."], "When Merrylegs the dog returns to the circus, Mr. Sleary says it\u2019s a sign that ___.": [" \u2018Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them\u2014which is one of his tricks. He looked at father, and didn\u2019t do it at once. Everything of father\u2019s had gone wrong that night, and he hadn\u2019t pleased the public at all. He cried out that the very dog knew he was failing, and had no compassion on him. Then he beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, \u201cFather, father! Pray don\u2019t hurt the creature who is so fond of you! O Heaven forgive you, father, stop!\u201d And he stopped, and the dog was bloody, and father lay down crying on the floor with the dog in his arms, and the dog licked his face.\u2019 Louisa saw that she was sobbing; and going to her, kissed her, took her hand, and sat down beside her. \u2018Finish by telling me how your father left you, Sissy. Now that I have asked you so much, tell me the end. The blame, if there is any blame, is mine, not yours.\u2019 \u2018Dear Miss Louisa,\u2019 said Sissy, covering her eyes, and sobbing yet; \u2018I came home from the school that afternoon, and found poor father just come home too, from the booth.", " It was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog barking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him, with his one practicable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his particular attentions. Soon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a formidable creature) already pinning Bitzer with his eye, and sticking close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight. The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense. At eight o\u2019clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high spirits. \u2018All right, Thquire!\u2019 said Mr. Sleary, \u2018your thon may be aboard-a-thip by thith time. Childerth took him off, an hour and a half after we left there latht night.

Now, Thquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, I thould like one parting word with you.\u2019 Louisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; Mr. Sleary, stirring and drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went on: \u2018Thquire,\u2014you don\u2019t need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.\u2019 \u2018Their instinct,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind, \u2018is surprising.\u2019 \u2018Whatever you call it\u2014and I\u2019m bletht if _I_ know what to call it\u2019\u2014said Sleary, \u2018it ith athtonithing.

They kept him, many times, from what did him real harm. And often and often of a night, he used to forget all his troubles in wondering whether the Sultan would let the lady go on with the story, or would have her head cut off before it was finished.\u2019 \u2018And your father was always kind? To the last?\u2019 asked Louisa contravening the great principle, and wondering very much. \u2018Always, always!\u2019 returned Sissy, clasping her hands. \u2018Kinder and kinder than I can tell. He was angry only one night, and that was not to me, but Merrylegs. Merrylegs;\u2019 she whispered the awful fact; \u2018is his performing dog.\u2019 \u2018Why was he angry with the dog?\u2019 Louisa demanded."]}
